Investigations into paranormal phenomena, including remote viewing and mind control, have been conducted by various governments, most notably the United States, with roots tracing back to World War II era occult research by the Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## United States' Paranormal Projects

The [[The role of technology and government in the UFO phenomenon|United States]] undertook psychic and paranormal tests involving soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. These efforts intensified in the 1970s due to beliefs that Russians possessed paranormal spies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. One instance cited involves the mysterious leakage of atomic codes, leading to a theory that Russian paranormal spies accessed a general's dreams, reminiscent of the movie *Inception* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Project Stargate

Project Stargate aimed to develop psychics for the army, primarily located at Fort Meade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This project is well-documented in the book *The Men Who Stared at Goats* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
Major General Albert Stubblebine, a three-star army general and head of intelligence, commissioned Colonel Jim Channon to research these phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

The initial experiments were conducted at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) under physicist Hal Puthoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Remote Viewing**: Participants, like Ingo Swan, attempted to describe drawings hidden in a distant drawer. While often incorrect, successful attempts were linked to a "nervous tick" and specific brainwave patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. This led to the development of a "remote viewing" protocol, improving accuracy from 20% to 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Notable Participants**: Uri Geller, known for bending forks, participated in the early phase of Project Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Geller, an Israeli army member, possessed strange abilities, reportedly stopping an armored vehicle and causing lights to go out in a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. He also allegedly predicted the 1972 Munich Olympics tragedy, which involved Israeli athletes, but his warnings were dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. After this, he joined the US Army for the Stargate project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Ultimate Goal**: General Stubblebine stated the ultimate goal was to develop skills beyond remote viewing, culminating in the ability to kill a goat just by staring at it, which gives the book its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. While outright killing was not observed by skeptical journalist Jon Ronson, he witnessed a participant successfully knock out a mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Another objective was to enable soldiers to pass through walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Continuity**: When the project became public, the government downplayed its success with a "Limited Hangout" strategy, claiming low success rates and closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. However, insiders like Joseph McMoneagle claimed the 20% success rate was for otherwise "unresolvable" cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. According to Jon Ronson, the project continued, being reactivated after 9/11 and potentially remaining active with its "10th generation" of paranormal soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

### MK-Ultra Project

The MK-Ultra project is not a conspiracy theory but a documented CIA mind control program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>. It was stumbled upon during the Church Commission in 1974 while investigating illegal CIA killings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. The project involved using substances to manipulate individuals into committing atrocities and brainwashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. The "K" in MK-Ultra stands for "Kontrol," meaning control in German, suggesting its origins or inspiration from German research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.

## Nazi Occultism and Super Soldiers

During World War II, Joseph Mengele was actively pursuing the development of "super soldiers" with unlimited resources and human subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. This focus gained traction under Hitler, influenced by a mystical German conception of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, was a key investor in supernatural and spiritual research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

The Nazis justified their "master race" ideology by reinterpreting history through Theosophy, particularly the teachings of Helena Blavatsky, to claim Aryan descent from Atlantean civilizations who were "children of the Gods" (Nordic gods like Odin and Thor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. This belief fueled the pursuit of developing exceptional skills in soldiers, often within secret societies like the Thule Society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. They believed in mobilizing a spiritual energy called "Vril" to make Germans invincible, especially with access to sacred relics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

### Holy Relics and Weapons

Hitler sought specific relics, including the Spear of Longinus (believed to have pierced Christ's side) and the Imperial Crown, believing their possession would make him invincible and establish a "Third Reich" (Third Roman Empire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. This pursuit is documented in Sidney Kirk Patrick's book *The Holy Relics of Hitler* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. The Nazis also pursued the Ark of the Covenant, believing it would unleash divine power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>, potentially creating a weapon of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

While the US focused on the Manhattan Project (atomic bomb), the Nazis invested in mystical and electromagnetic/anti-gravity technologies, including the "Die Glocke" (The Bell), an alleged anti-gravity UFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Operation Paperclip and Continuity

After World War II, Operation Paperclip saw the United States recruit top German scientists (including figures like Wernher Von Braun and Joseph Mengele) who had worked on advanced projects, often by offering immunity from prosecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. This included not only aerospace engineers but also occultists, who contributed to research in mind control and behavioral control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

Some Nazi projects, including those related to relics and super soldiers, were allegedly continued in South America, particularly Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Joseph Mengele is officially said to have died in Brazil, though conspiracy theories suggest he lived much longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

## Super Soldier Testimonies

While direct documentation is scarce, there are testimonies of super soldiers. One prominent case is Robert Duncan O’Fin, who claims to have been a guinea pig in a super soldier project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
*   **False Memories and Manipulation**: O’Fin experienced vivid war nightmares without combat experience, later discovering his adolescent memories were fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>. He alleges his father, a secret agent, offered him to "Project Talent" (under the MK-Ultra umbrella) at age six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.
*   **Project Talent**: This project sought "receivers"—children whose minds could be controlled remotely via telepathy. O’Fin demonstrated this ability by completing a complex puzzle telepathically guided by a German woman named Elga, a scientist brought over by Operation Paperclip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. The project aimed to create super soldiers who were unaware of their true capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.
*   **Trauma-Based Mind Control**: The primary method for creating dissociative personalities (a core element of super soldiers) was trauma-based mind control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. This involved inducing extreme pain with substances like LSD while preventing fainting, forcing the brain to partition its identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. The goal was to create "sleeper assassins" who could perform missions without conscious knowledge, making them undetectable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.
*   **Physical Manifestations**: O’Fin claims that an MRI scan "fried" a brain implant, causing his repressed memories to resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>. He shows evidence of broken vertebrae yet functions normally, attributing it to an implant in his shoulder and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>. He also recounts incidents of superhuman strength (breaking a man's neck in a bar fight) and even phasing through walls, abilities reminiscent of those sought in Project Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>.

## Pop Culture and Real-World Influence

The concept of super soldiers and mind control has heavily influenced pop culture.
*   **The Manchurian Candidate**: This film, re-filmed with Denzel Washington, depicts soldiers brainwashed to become sleeper agents, with false memories implanted and activation triggered by specific cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>. The term "Manchurian Candidate" originated from the Korean War, where Americans allegedly discovered similar mind control projects by Chinese and Japanese forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a>.
*   **Winter Soldier**: The Marvel character Winter Soldier, activated by coded phrases from a red book, mirrors these mind control theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.
*   **Stranger Things**: The show's narrative is largely based on the Montauk Project, a supposed secret government experiment at a former military base on Long Island. This base, managed by the Department of Energy (like in the show), experimented with giant antennas that influenced local behavior, causing spikes in crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:36">[01:43:36]</a>. The Montauk Project also allegedly involved psychic children and astral projection, leading to encounters with "Montauk Monsters" (the inspiration for the Demogorgon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Alter Egos**: The concept of multiple personalities also appears in the entertainment industry, with artists like Britney Spears, Lady Gaga (Dom Calderone), and Beyoncé (Sasha Fierce) having distinct alter egos. Some theories suggest this phenomenon might stem from mind control, linking it to the entertainment industry's "shadowy" aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. Mel Gibson attributes his public outbursts to an alter ego named "Bjorne," a "Viking soldier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>.

### Modern Figures and Theories

*   **Elon Musk and Underground Bases**: Elon Musk's Boring Company, a tunnel-drilling firm, has investors with interests in luxury underground bunkers, leading to speculation that it is creating shelters for an anticipated "geophysical event" or mass extinction, which Musk himself hints at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. His drive to colonize Mars is presented as an escape from impending global catastrophes like a third world war or pole inversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Antichrist Theories**: Theories connect Donald Trump's birth during a lunar eclipse and blood moon, shortly after Jack Parsons' Babalon Working ritual in 1946 (which aimed to conjure a "moon child" or "antichrist"), to the idea of him being an "antichrist baby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, is also speculated to be a potential antichrist figure due to his role in the Abraham Accords and bringing a "false peace" as prophesied in Revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:11">[02:32:11]</a>.
*   **Occult Alliances in Military**: Claims exist that entities like Michael Aquino, an army officer and leader of the Temple of Set (a Satanic organization), work to "appease" aliens, fallen angels, or demons with offerings in places like Area 51, suggesting direct cooperation between the military and occult forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:02">[02:29:02]</a>.
*   **The Ark of the Covenant as a Weapon**: The Ark of the Covenant is theorized to be a weapon of mass destruction, leading Hitler to seek it, believing it would make him invincible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:47">[02:12:47]</a>. Author Chris Thomas theorizes the Ark is the only object capable of editing the "Akashic Record" (a spiritual blockchain of cosmic events), which malevolent alien entities seek to manipulate to portray themselves as human creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:21">[02:17:21]</a>.

## Conclusion

While many of these stories intertwine [[Ufology and extraterrestrial life|UFO Phenomena]], [[historical_ufo_cases|Historical UFO Cases]], and [[cultural_and_psychological_aspects_of_ufo_experiences|Cultural and Psychological Aspects of UFO Experiences]] with military and occult themes, they remain largely in the realm of speculation and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>. However, the documented existence of projects like Stargate and MK-Ultra underscores that governments have indeed explored the potential of paranormal phenomena for strategic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:09">[01:32:09]</a>.

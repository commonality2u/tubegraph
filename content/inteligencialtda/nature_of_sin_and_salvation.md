The true Gospel of Christ necessitates an understanding of creation, the fall, and [[Christianity and redemption | redemption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The word "gospel" originates from the Greek "evangelium," meaning "good news" or "good message" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## The Genesis of Sin
God created the heavens and the earth in six days, culminating in humanity as His masterpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Man was made in God's image and likeness, possessing communicable attributes like kindness, justice, love, and holiness, making humanity morally just and perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, God gave humanity one command: not to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Man violated this law, introducing sin into all creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Sin is likened to a virus that corrupts a system without destroying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Similarly, humanity became corrupt, leading to curses upon the serpent, woman (pain in childbirth), and man/earth (toil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The worst consequence of sin is spiritual death, which entails eternal damnation to hell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. All descendants of Adam and Eve were condemned with them, inheriting this "infection" of sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## God's Dilemma and the Solution
God must condemn sin because it violates His perfect justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. A just judge must punish sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The dilemma arises: how can a just God save unjust sinners without compromising His justice? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a> God cannot simply forgive sins without violating His justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The solution to this dilemma lies in Jesus Christ and His crucifixion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. God's plan was to send His son, who was God, to become man and replace humanity by dying on the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. On the cross, Jesus takes humanity's sins upon Himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Instead of punishing sins in humanity, God punishes them in Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This is an act of substitution: Christ assumes the guilt and penalty for humanity's sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

> "This is the most beautiful love story, story that the world has already heard..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:59">[01:39:59]</a>

### Jesus: 100% God and 100% Man
For God's plan to be executed, only a perfect man could replace humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:22">[01:42:22]</a>. A perfect man is one who never sinned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>. Jesus came as 100% God and 100% man, coexisting in the same person without mixing (hypostatic union) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:22">[01:42:22]</a>. As a man, Jesus experienced temptations, but unlike humanity, He did not sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>. If Jesus were only man, He would not have been able to endure the penalty and survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>.

God the Father Himself "killed" Jesus on the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. When Jesus died, all humanity's sin was cast upon Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>. God, seeing the immense iniquity, poured out His wrath—His answer to sin—upon Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>. This act demonstrates the terror of sin and God's holiness, as He did not spare His own son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>. The agony in Gethsemane, where Jesus sweat blood, was His experience of hell before the cross, as He began to bear the wrath intended for sinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:23">[03:32:23]</a>. The "cup" Jesus prayed to be spared from was becoming sin, a curse, and bearing God's full wrath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:57">[03:51:57]</a>.

## The Significance of the Resurrection
The gospel does not end with Jesus' death; it continues with His resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>. Only a God could bear the wrath of God and rise from the dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>. The resurrection serves two crucial purposes:
1.  **Proof of Divinity**: It proves Jesus' divinity, as only God could resurrect Himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>.
2.  **Acceptance of Sacrifice**: It proves that Jesus' sacrifice was sufficient and accepted by God as payment for humanity's sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>.

Unlike other religious figures, there are no mortal remains of Jesus because "he is risen from the Dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:36">[02:37:36]</a>.

## Receiving [[The theological significance of salvation and grace | Salvation and Grace]]
[[The theological significance of salvation and grace | Salvation]] is described as a gift, received by grace, requiring no payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:43">[02:44:43]</a>. The response required to the Gospel message is repentance and belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:37">[04:15:37]</a>.
*   **Repentance (Metanoia)**: A change of mind, vision, and path; turning away from sinful ways that lead to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:40">[04:26:40]</a>.
*   **Faith**: Casting one's trust for salvation not in oneself or works, but entirely in Jesus Christ's death and resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:18">[04:47:18]</a>.

Upon repentance and belief, individuals receive a favorable sentence in God's court, being "justified" and declared righteous before God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>. This means passing from death to life, no longer under condemnation, as God sees their sins in Christ and Christ's righteousness in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:18">[04:47:18]</a>.

### The Role of the Holy Spirit in [[Christianity and redemption | Redemption]]
The Father creates the plan of salvation, the Son executes it through His death on the cross, and the Holy Spirit applies the plan to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:11">[05:11:11]</a>. The Holy Spirit works supernaturally, transforming, revealing Christ, providing understanding of the Gospel, and illuminating the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:57">[05:15:57]</a>. His role is to open eyes and hearts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:41">[05:39:41]</a>.

### True Conversion and [[Personal transformation and faith | Personal Transformation]]
True conversion, or [[Personal transformation and redemption journey | regeneration]], is a supernatural work of God's power, greater than the power used to create the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. It is not merely an improvement, but a complete recreation of a fallen, corrupt being into the image of Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

> "Conversion is not an improved, is not wearing a little outfit, religion. God takes away the heart of stone and put the heart of flesh, is as if a manta ray me cross and disfigure me and I become another being. That is conversion." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>

False conversions occur when people declare themselves saved without undergoing this profound transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. Evidence of salvation is not baptism, spiritual gifts, or church membership, but the internal regeneration by the Holy Spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. Without being born again of the Spirit, one cannot enter the kingdom of heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>. The power for this transformation comes from the message of the Gospel itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

### The Reality of Hell
Hell is the ultimate consequence of rejecting Jesus' sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:34">[04:31:34]</a>. The Bible describes hell with terms like "world of the dead" (Sheol/Hades) and "Gehenna" (Valley of Rinon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a>. Gehenna, in Jesus' time, was Jerusalem's perpetually burning garbage dump, symbolizing unimaginable suffering, unceasing pain, absence of beauty, and eternal duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:54">[04:34:54]</a>.

> "Hell is the trash of humanity that's where it's going to be released everything that is rotten in this society." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:50">[04:49:50]</a>

Hell is also called the Lake of Fire, where the devil, fallen angels, demons, the beast, and the false prophet will be thrown, along with all who rejected the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:56">[04:56:56]</a>. The suffering is eternal because the transgression is against an eternal God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:40">[05:11:40]</a>. Hell is not due to God's absence but by His presence, as He punishes sinners as a Lion, not a Lamb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:56">[04:50:56]</a>.

### The Power of [[Christianity forgiveness and salvation | Forgiveness]]
[[Christianity forgiveness and salvation | Forgiveness]] is understood by looking at the cross, where God, the offended party, extended immense forgiveness to humanity for countless transgressions against His holiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:39">[02:51:39]</a>. Receiving such profound forgiveness makes it impossible to deny forgiveness to others, regardless of the offense's level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:15">[02:54:15]</a>. If someone struggles to forgive, it may indicate they have not truly understood or received God's forgiveness themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:11">[02:53:11]</a>.

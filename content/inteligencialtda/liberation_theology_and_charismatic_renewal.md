The relationship and distinctions between [[cultural_and_spiritual_movements_influencing_society | Liberation Theology]] and [[cultural_and_spiritual_movements_influencing_society | Charismatic Renewal]] within the Catholic Church are significant, particularly in their historical contexts and approaches to faith and social engagement.

## Liberation Theology

[[cultural_and_spiritual_movements_influencing_society | Liberation Theology]] is described as a theological movement that had its "peak moment" in a "Pastoral Biblical Interpretation theological from the excluded menus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. This means that all hermeneutics (interpretation) and theology were viewed from the perspective of the excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. It played a "very large" and important role in its era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

Key figures associated with [[cultural_and_spiritual_movements_influencing_society | Liberation Theology]] include:
*   Leonardo Boff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>
*   Gustavo Gutierrez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>
*   Frei Carlos Pocket (masters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>

[[cultural_and_spiritual_movements_influencing_society | Liberation Theology]] was "very connected to the PT" (Workers' Party in Brazil), focusing on "the letters in the working classes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. While it still exists today, it was more widely discussed in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

## Charismatic Renewal

The [[cultural_and_spiritual_to_movements_influencing_society | Charismatic Renewal]] "arose as a call from the Spirit Saint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a> and entered the church through an "evangelical bias" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. Initially, it was viewed by some as a "delay" and was criticized for being "very out of the" norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. However, it is now "well constituted" within the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

The speaker recounts a [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | personal experience]] with the [[cultural_and_spiritual_to_movements_influencing_society | Charismatic Renewal]] where they were "baptized in the Holy Spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. This experience, which involved a "laying on of hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a> and an "invocation of Holy Spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>, led to a "conversion within the my conversion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a> and a feeling of "greater fervor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a> and desire for prayer and the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This is seen as living one's baptism in the Holy Spirit, which is described as "something very strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

## Opposition and Coexistence

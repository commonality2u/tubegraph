The United States has a dedicated Department of [[space_exploration_and_planetary_defense | Planetary Defense]] tasked with mapping, monitoring, and understanding potential collision risks from celestial objects like asteroids and comets [02:06:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:51">[02:06:51]</a>. This sector currently receives the most significant investment in the [[space_exploration_and_planetary_defense | space sector]] [02:46:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:47">[02:46:47]</a>.

## Asteroid Mining and Composition
While asteroid mining is considered a very distant prospect, asteroids are believed to contain valuable minerals and metals like gold, platinum, and silver [02:50:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:32">[02:50:32]</a>. In contrast, comets are primarily composed of ice and are generally not considered to have anything of interest for resource extraction [02:50:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:37">[02:50:37]</a>.

The Pioneer probe, the first to cross the asteroid belt, revealed that asteroids are very distant from each other, making collisions with spacecraft unlikely [03:56:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:55">[03:56:55]</a>.

## Classifying Impact Risks
The Department of [[space_exploration_and_planetary_defense | Planetary Defense]] classifies celestial objects by risk, primarily based on their size and distance from Earth [02:54:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:51">[02:54:51]</a>.

### Global Disaster
Objects capable of causing a global disaster, like the one that led to the extinction of dinosaurs, are very large asteroids [02:55:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:06">[02:55:06]</a>. Approximately 99% of these objects have been mapped and monitored, with no known threat of impact in the next 100 years [02:55:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:19">[02:55:19]</a>.

### Continental Disaster
A continental disaster would not end life on Earth, but an impact in a major city, for example, could severely affect an entire continent [03:15:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>. Over 90% of these objects are also mapped and monitored [03:15:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:32">[03:15:32]</a>.

### Local Disaster
Local disaster-level objects, ranging from 30 to 40 meters in size, are the most problematic to monitor due to their smaller size [03:15:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:38">[03:15:38]</a>. An example is the Chelyabinsk meteor event in Russia in 2013, caused by a 13-meter object [03:27:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:28">[03:27:28]</a>. These objects can burn up in the atmosphere, but still release significant energy, causing local damage [03:37:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39">[03:37:39]</a>. Objects coming from the direction of the Sun are particularly difficult to detect [03:40:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>.

## Mitigation Strategies and Simulations
Currently, there are no readily available solutions to prevent an impact from a hazardous object [03:20:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>. Using missiles is not a good option as it could divert the object to a worse location [03:20:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:26">[03:20:26]</a>. Ideas being studied include sending a ship to tap an object if discovered early enough to subtly alter its trajectory [03:20:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:39">[03:20:39]</a>, and powerful lasers, though this is considered science fiction [03:33:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:06">[03:33:06]</a>.

Space agencies, including NASA and Russia, conduct annual simulations of an asteroid impact to train protocols for evacuation and response [03:24:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:26">[03:24:26]</a>.

## Comets vs. Asteroids
Comets are very visible and typically pass far from Earth, making a collision highly unlikely [03:32:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Asteroids, however, pose a greater concern due to their potential proximity and mineral composition.

## Jupiter's Role in Planetary Defense
Jupiter plays a significant role in protecting Earth by attracting or deflecting objects with its immense gravity, preventing them from hitting inner planets [03:57:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:55">[03:57:55]</a>. However, it can also disturb orbits and potentially send objects towards Earth [03:57:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:15">[03:57:15]</a>.

## Earth's Past Ring
It is theorized that Earth may have had a ring at some point, possibly when the Moon formed about 4 billion years ago from debris after a Mars-sized object (Theia) collided with Earth [04:16:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:17">[04:16:17]</a>. These pieces eventually coalesced to form the Moon [04:22:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:23">[04:22:23]</a>.

Discussions on economic systems often center around the role and impact of state intervention. Two minds, Elias Jabbour and Renata Barreto, debated whether state involvement is beneficial or detrimental to an economy, referencing historical examples and modern-day economic realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Arguments for State Intervention

According to Elias Jabbour, capitalism itself is a state creation, with market mechanisms being products of state action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>. He argues that historical institutional innovations essential for capitalism, such as the law of enclosures or the formation of the Bank of England, were carried out by the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. He maintains that today, it's impossible to discuss capitalism without the state, citing the United States' trillion-dollar investments in knowledge frontiers to compete with China technologically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

Jabbour contends that the formation of oligopolies is a natural trend, a "law of concentration and centralization of Capital," rather than a problem caused by state interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. He supports this by arguing that countries like Germany, South Korea, and the United States became major industrial powers through strong state presence and protectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He also points to Taiwan's industrialization, which occurred with a very strong, state-guided presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. State purchases, he argues, foster national systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>.

Furthermore, Jabbour asserts that technology, including innovations like the iPhone and the internet, are state creations, funded by state money and the military-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He views global capital as operating in large blocks, with powerful states protecting their respective economic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. According to Jabbour, no country has achieved high economic complexity without significant state protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>, and the greater a country's technological advancement, the greater the state's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>.

On the topic of inflation, Jabbour cites modern monetary theory, stating that a direct link between monetary emission and inflation is observed only in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He notes that China's high investment rate (45%) allows it to create currency to manage crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He claims there is a consensus among American orthodox economists that state intervention, making currency non-neutral in the short term, is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He attributes current global inflation to disruptions in the global value chain from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, not solely to money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>.

Jabbour argues that countries like Germany, South Korea, and Japan, characterized by strong state intervention, especially in industrial policies, demonstrate successful models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He refutes the idea that Brazil's state is "bloated" compared to countries like Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He contends that the decline in Brazil's share of wages in its GDP points to a significant economic setback, returning to 1930s levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He highlights that in Germany, powerful oligopolistic companies work alongside state-backed banks, forming strong safety nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>.

He emphasizes China's remarkable growth under state guidance, including increasing life expectancy from 35 years in 1949 to nearly 80 years today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>, surpassing the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He attributes this to correct policies and public health interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. Jabbour also points to China's massive investment in green technologies, surpassing Europe and the United States combined, and its commitment to reaching peak emissions by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. He highlights China's rapid development of high-speed rail and its ability to plan creative destruction, suggesting that the state takes the lead in technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>.

## Arguments Against State Intervention

Renata Barreto argues that while state presence in capitalism is real, capitalism was not born from the state but from the natural evolution of commerce, dating back to the Stone Age with bartering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She differentiates between the state's presence in capitalism and capitalism being a state creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

Barreto contends that the problem of oligopolies and monopolies arises from excessive state interference, not from an inherent flaw in capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She uses Brazil as an example of "state capitalism" where heavy state regulation, bureaucracy, difficult labor legislation, and high tariffs hinder economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. This environment, she argues, makes it difficult for small businesses to start and compete, thereby exacerbating the formation of large monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

She cites data indicating that countries with greater [[economic_freedom_and_regulation | economic freedom]] tend to be more prosperous, such as Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Estonia, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. These countries, in her view, have smaller governments, less bureaucracy, and simpler tax systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She clarifies that liberalism does not advocate for no state, but rather for a state that remains within certain controls and performs crucial roles in specific areas like education, safety, and health, possibly through public-private partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

Barreto criticizes the increase in state interference in the United States, which has led to a decline in its [[economic_freedom_and_regulation | economic freedom]] ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She points out that the US Constitution was designed to limit government power over citizens, not the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

Regarding inflation, Barreto agrees with Roberto Campos's view that most inflation is monetary, stating that excessive money in circulation devalues it, like any other commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She attributes recent inflation to the massive issuance of dollars (43% of current circulation issued in the last two years) and supply shocks caused by state-imposed lockdowns and the energy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She criticizes government mandates on energy sources (e.g., forcing reliance on wind and solar over nuclear) as state interference that creates problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

Barreto argues that China's complete state planning leads to inefficiencies, citing the real estate bubble as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She supports protectionism against countries like China due to ethical and moral concerns, such as theft of intellectual property and human rights abuses (ethnic cleansing of Uyghurs), arguing that the US should not operate under the same moral ruler as China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She also criticizes China for not participating in the Paris Agreement on climate change, allowing it to pollute more than other nations that are constrained by such agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

She refutes the idea that wealthy nations necessarily require heavy state intervention, citing countries like Switzerland and Luxembourg as examples of rich nations without high taxes or bloated states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She argues that the concept of "state capitalism" in Brazil, characterized by excessive regulations and privileges for those close to the government, is a form of cronyism or corporatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

Barreto believes that [[historical_views_on_economic_freedom_and_regulation | economic liberalism]] is not a fantasy, as demonstrated by the prosperity of countries that reduced state intervention between 1850 and 1950, enabling them to build strong economies that could later afford social welfare states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She asserts that the state's role should be to maintain the rule of law, ensure integrity in government, provide low and simple taxation, and foster flexible labor laws to encourage [[impact_of_state_policies_on_economic_growth_and_innovation | entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

She criticizes the notion that capitalism kills millions, arguing that countries with high death tolls from hunger or low quality of life are typically those with low [[economic_freedom_and_regulation | economic freedom]], high state interference, weak property rights, and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. The growth of wealth and population since the Industrial Revolution is, to her, evidence of capitalism's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

In the context of Venezuela, Barreto states that the country's economic problems are a result of its socialist policies, including expropriation of private property and direct interventions, and that the freezing of Venezuelan assets by the Bank of England constitutes theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of democracy and free expression, contrasting them with the lack of freedoms in countries like China and Cuba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

She argues that technological advancements, rather than causing job loss, replace unhealthy and repetitive jobs, leading to increased income and new employment opportunities, contrary to Marxist predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. She highlights the failure of state-owned enterprises in Brazil, such as Telebras, despite some past technological achievements, arguing that privatization leads to better service through competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

Barreto concludes that excessive state intervention in economies, characterized by high bureaucracy, complex regulations, and increased government spending, stifles [[impact_of_state_policies_on_economic_growth_and_innovation | individual freedom]] and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

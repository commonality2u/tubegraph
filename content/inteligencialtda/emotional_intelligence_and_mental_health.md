### The Impact of Modern Life on Mental Well-being

The modern world, characterized by rapid technological advancement and social media, presents unique challenges to [[mental_health_and_disorders | mental health]]. The increasing instability in professions and the blurring lines between virtual and real life contribute significantly to feelings of [[role_of_stress_and_anxiety_in_mental_health | anxiety]], panic, fear, and [[mental_health_and_disorders | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. This societal shift means individuals must learn to "surf this instability" and maintain happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>.

#### Social Media and Mental Health

[[Social Media and Mental Health | Social networks]] have gained significant importance, leading many people to live more virtual lives than real ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a>. This virtual existence can lead to a disconnection from reality, as seen in the case of a reality show participant who experienced a psychotic episode when confronted with real life without the filters and control of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

A major concern among the younger generation is the fear of "cancellation" on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>. A Fiocruz survey from 2011 to 2022 revealed a 6% increase in suicide rates among young people and teenagers, and a 29% rise in self-harm and self-mutilation, with the fear of cancellation being a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>. This environment fosters a "society of performance," where individuals constantly feel the need to prove themselves and fear being perceived as failures, leading to an epidemic of [[mental_health_and_disorders | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>. This pressure to perform and seek external validation transforms individuals into "products on people's shelves," losing their essence as human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>.

### The Role of Emotional Intelligence

In response to these challenges, the development of [[the_importance_of_emotional_intelligence | emotional intelligence]] is crucial, especially for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. Teaching children about brain function and how to manage [[role_of_stress_and_anxiety_in_mental_health | anxiety]] triggers from an early age can help them learn to self-manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. Treating children with respect and allowing them to learn from mistakes, rather than constantly seeking approval, fosters resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

The concept of "liquid relationships," where everything is immediate and disposable if it doesn't provide constant pleasure, highlights the impulsiveness and lack of long-term commitment in modern connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. This contrasts with the idea that love in relationships requires cultivation, effort, and navigating difficult conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>.

### Understanding Mental Health Conditions

*   **Psychotic Episode**: A momentary break from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. This can be triggered by severe stress, lack of sleep, energy drinks, or drug use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>.
*   **Dysthymia**: A chronic form of [[mental_health_and_disorders | depression]], characterized by a persistent negative mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>. Treatment often involves therapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps individuals challenge negative thought patterns and recognize their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>.
*   **Aphasia and Dementia**: Lifestyle choices, such as diet, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, heavily influence brain health and can accelerate conditions like dementia and aphasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:54">[01:30:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Physical activity, for instance, promotes neuronal growth factors crucial for brain health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>.
*   **Gaslighting**: A form of psychological harassment in relationships where one person manipulates another into believing they are to blame for all problems, often leading to extreme dependence and self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>.
*   **Chronic Anxiety**: A persistent state of fear, where the brain interprets hypothetical threats as real dangers, leading to constant activation of the body's stress response system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:20">[02:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:49">[02:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:34">[02:11:34]</a>. This chronic activation can cause physical illness and limit one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:53">[02:11:53]</a>. A key step in treatment is understanding that one does not have control over almost anything in life, including intrusive thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:12">[02:14:12]</a>.
*   **Phobias**: Specific, irrational fears disproportionate to the actual threat, such as the fear of cockroaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:55">[02:28:55]</a>. Exposure therapy, including virtual reality, can be effective in treating phobias by gradually desensitizing the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:59">[02:28:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>.
*   **Syndrome of Wendy**: A pattern where an individual excessively cares for others to the point of neglecting their own needs, living primarily to be necessary to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:09">[02:35:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:54">[02:35:54]</a>.

### [[Psychological and spiritual maturation in relationships | Psychological and Spiritual Maturation]]

Maturity involves taking responsibility for one's life and engaging in [[psychological_and_spiritual_maturation_in_relationships | spiritual deepening]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. This contrasts with a societal emphasis on "endless youth at any cost," which hinders evolution towards maturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>. True maturity is reflected in developing an intellectual and spiritual heritage, valuing things beyond immediate gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:40">[01:42:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:36">[01:43:36]</a>.

Life is a continuous learning process, akin to a university or a video game with increasing levels of challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:44">[01:45:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:56">[01:45:56]</a>. Acceptance of suffering as an inevitable part of life allows for growth and the ability to cope with future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Self-care practices, such as a relaxing bath or a skincare routine, offer moments for reflection and emotional cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:03">[01:47:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:35">[01:47:35]</a>.

### Evolution of Psychology and Psychiatry

The fields of psychology and psychiatry are likely to be among the last professions to be replaced by artificial intelligence due to the irreplaceable human element of interaction and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:26">[02:20:26]</a>. However, the future of these fields will increasingly integrate neuroscientific studies, neuromodulation techniques (like transcranial magnetic stimulation), and evidence-based therapies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:33">[02:20:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:51">[02:20:51]</a>. Genetic testing (neuropharmacogenomics) can also guide medication choices, optimizing treatment efficacy and reducing side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:46">[01:49:46]</a>.

[[Artificial intelligence and technology | Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is transforming various aspects of life, from employment to societal structures, by leveraging algorithms that learn from data and examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:04">[09:55:04]</a>.

## Understanding Artificial Intelligence

[[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | Machine learning]] is a subset of [[artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning | artificial intelligence]] where machines learn rules from data and examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:20">[11:15:20]</a>. Unlike classic [[artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning | artificial intelligence]] where systems are directly programmed to make smart decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:09">[10:39:09]</a>, [[artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning | machine learning]] involves guiding computers to learn from patterns, similar to how a child learns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. This learning is not merely a metaphor; the algorithm genuinely learns rules, for example, to differentiate between a dog and a cat by processing millions of images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:47">[13:45:47]</a>.

There are two main types of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications | algorithms]]:
*   **Generative Algorithms** These algorithms create a product, such as text or images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. Examples include ChatGPT for text generation and Midjourney for image creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. They can even generate audio and video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.
*   **Predictive Algorithms** These algorithms predict outcomes based on vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>. For instance, in healthcare, they can predict disease diagnoses or patient prognoses by analyzing millions of patient data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.

A key concept in [[artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning | machine learning]] is "reinforcement learning," where an algorithm learns through punishments and rewards, similar to how a dog learns to sit or a person learns to play a video game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.

## [[The Impact of Technology on Society | Impact on Employment]]

Technological revolutions throughout history have consistently generated more jobs than they've cut, though this time [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] is affecting cognitive jobs, not just manual ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The shift can be traumatic, but it also leads to new and potentially more interesting job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>.

> "The jobs were created, right? I could imagine that this would happen. So we can't imagine even today what kind of jobs will there be specially created for productivity only from the wealth of society but with. We're sure we'll find new ones. jobs new areas much more interesting for us to do than do something that a robot does, right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>

Examples of evolving roles and new professions:
*   **Radiologists:** While AI can diagnose issues from X-rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:67:00">[02:67:00]</a>, radiologists who integrate [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | artificial intelligence]] into their practice will replace those who don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>. Radiology is, in fact, the fastest-growing medical specialty in the U.S., becoming more productive and affordable due to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:36">[02:27:36]</a>.
*   **Illustrators and Artists:** Generative AI can create original art by combining learned styles (e.g., a robot in Van Gogh's style) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. Artists might shift from direct creation to guiding AI for drafts or exploring new creative avenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:16">[01:54:16]</a>.
*   **Screenwriters:** AI can generate scripts, outlines, and ideas, helping writers overcome creative blocks and improve efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Prompt Engineers:** A new profession, though potentially temporary, involves crafting precise instructions for AI to generate desired outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:53">[02:13:53]</a>.

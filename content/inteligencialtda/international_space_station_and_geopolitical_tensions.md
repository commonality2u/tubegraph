The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique collaborative project built by five main space agencies: Russia's Roscosmos, the United States' NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan's JAXA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. This global partnership has traditionally allowed for joint operations and scientific research in space.

## Impact of the [[impact_of_war_on_space_exploration | War in Ukraine]]

The ongoing [[impact_of_war_on_space_exploration | war in Ukraine]] has had a significant and "gigantic" impact on [[space_exploration_and_astronomy | space exploration]], particularly due to Russia's involvement as a major space-faring nation with global projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Dmitry Rogozin and Roscosmos

Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos (Russia's equivalent of NASA), is a politician, not a space sector technician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. He has been more vocal than Russian President Putin regarding the war, even changing his Twitter profile picture to one of himself in military attire with a nuclear warhead in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

Rogozin has used Twitter and Russian podcasts to issue threats and retaliate against Western sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>:
*   He questioned what would happen if Russia withdrew its parts from the ISS, suggesting it could crash in the United States or another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   Russia ceased selling a specific type of rocket engine used by American rockets and halted support for existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   All Russian personnel were ordered to leave the French Guiana launch base in Kourou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   Roscosmos refused to launch OneWeb satellites, despite the contract being paid, demanding the UK (a OneWeb shareholder) withdraw from the company's shareholders' table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. OneWeb may now launch these satellites with SpaceX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>.
*   The ExoMars mission, a joint project between Roscosmos and ESA involving the Rosalind Franklin rover, was canceled, leaving the rover's future uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

These actions are a direct response to Western sanctions and have created significant confusion in the [[space_exploration_and_astronomy | space sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Russia's actions are leading to its isolation in the [[space_exploration_and_astronomy | space industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

### Elon Musk's Involvement

Elon Musk, who recently acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, has actively engaged with Rogozin on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. He has tweeted in Russian and made provocative statements, sometimes influencing stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. His actions have led to concerns about potentially escalating [[potential_global_and_regional_escalations | global political and economic dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

### Future of the ISS

The current agreements among the ISS partners are facing severe strain, with "letters to one side, emails to the other" regarding the station's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Despite the tensions, astronauts on the ISS, including Americans and Russians, have shown solidarity, emphasizing that "on Earth men fight, here we are a crew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

Eventually, the ISS will transition into a private space station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, with private companies like Axiom Space beginning to launch missions. Axiom's first private mission, carrying four astronauts (three private, one former NASA astronaut), is scheduled to dock at the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Each seat on these private flights can cost around $20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## Key Players in [[space_exploration_and_astronomy | Space Exploration]]

Beyond the primary ISS partners, other nations also contribute significantly to the [[space_exploration_and_astronomy | space industry]]:
*   **Russia**: Despite current issues, Russia remains a major player, historically responsible for transporting astronauts to space for 11 years after the U.S. retired its shuttles in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. A seat on a Russian Soyuz ship cost the U.S. around $80 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
*   **China**: China has a highly developed and independent [[space_exploration_and_astronomy | space program]], with its own space station and a comprehensive system for navigation, remote sensing, and internet that does not rely on other nations' technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. It has achieved significant milestones, including landing a rover (Zhurong) on [[space_exploration_and_mars_colonization | Mars]] (a feat Russia never achieved) and a rover on the far side of the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. China's long-term planning, spanning decades, allows for sustained investment and progress in [[space_exploration_and_astronomy | space exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. China is also focused on exploiting resources like water and Helium-3 on the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>.
*   **Japan**: Possesses capabilities to launch satellites and rockets and has a module on the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.
*   **India**: Has its own rocket and a developing [[space_exploration_and_astronomy | space program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.
*   **European nations (e.g., France, Italy)**: While not always launching their own rockets, they are crucial in producing fundamental components like satellite "buses" (the satellite's main structure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>.

## Space Defense and Asteroid Monitoring

There is a growing emphasis on planetary defense, with the U.S. Department of Planetary Defense being the sector with the most investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>. This department maps and monitors asteroids and comets to predict potential Earth collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.
*   **Global Disaster Objects**: Asteroids large enough to cause global disasters, like the one that led to dinosaur extinction, are 99% mapped and monitored, with no threat of impact in the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>.
*   **Continental Disaster Objects**: Objects that could cause continental-scale disasters are over 90% mapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.
*   **Local Disaster Objects**: Smaller objects (e.g., 30-40 meters) that could destroy a city, like the Chelyabinsk meteor in Russia (2013), are harder to track due to their size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. These are the primary focus of planetary defense efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>. They are particularly hard to detect if they come from the direction of the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.

Current methods to deflect dangerous objects are still theoretical, including sending a ship to tap an asteroid to alter its trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>. Annually, space agencies conduct simulations of asteroid impact scenarios to train and refine protocols for evacuation and response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a>.

## [[the_challenges_of_space_travel and human limitations | Challenges of Space Travel and Human Limitations]]

Long-duration [[space_exploration_and_astronomy | space travel]] poses significant [[the_challenges_of_space_travel and human limitations | physiological challenges]] to the human body:
*   **Bone and Muscle Degradation**: Absence of gravity leads to spinal, muscle, and bone problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Astronauts must exercise extensively on the ISS to mitigate these effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:38">[01:26:38]</a>.
*   **Fluid Shifts**: Liquids in the body suffer in microgravity, affecting vision, hearing (e.g., Brazilian astronaut Marcos Pontes experienced hearing issues after 10 days in space), and inner ear function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.
*   **Cardiovascular Issues**: The heart is affected by zero gravity, leading to arrhythmias and other problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>.
*   **Radiation**: Radiation is a severe threat, suggesting that future human habitats on the Moon or [[space_exploration_and_mars_colonization | Mars]] might need to be underground in lava tubes for natural protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a>.

These challenges highlight that humans "were not made to live" in space, and a lot of research is being done on how to minimize these effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:03">[01:26:03]</a>. The idea of artificial gravity through centrifugal force is currently "economically unviable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.

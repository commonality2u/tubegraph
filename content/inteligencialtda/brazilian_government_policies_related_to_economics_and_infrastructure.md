## Economic Policy Under Bolsonaro
Former President Jair Bolsonaro stated that his administration focused on combating [[political corruption in Brazil | corruption]], claiming that unlike previous leaders, he was not investigated for corrupt practices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a> He asserted that state-owned companies achieved billion-dollar profits under his government, contrasting with previous losses in some entities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

### Anti-Corruption Measures
Bolsonaro highlighted the case of the Port of Santos, which he claimed went from an annual loss of R$500 million to a profit of R$500 million during his term. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a> He also pointed to issues at CEAGESP (General Warehouses and Supply Company of São Paulo), where, he alleged, various forms of illicit payments existed, including R$1,000/month in tips from cart pushers and R$100/month from coffee sellers, along with truck parking and stall rental bribes, and even prostitution and trafficking. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a> Bolsonaro estimated that over R$1 million per month was being diverted from CEAGESP through these illicit activities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a> Colonel Mela Araújo was brought in to address these problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>

### Fiscal and Monetary Policies
A key aspect of Bolsonaro's economic policy was the reduction of the tax burden. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a> He specifically mentioned zeroing federal taxes on fuels, a measure he criticized the current government for reinstating. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>

#### PIX Implementation
The PIX instant payment system was implemented in November 2020 during Bolsonaro's government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a> He noted that the Central Bank, which was headed by Roberto Campos Neto (appointed by Bolsonaro), was responsible for its creation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a> The system was expedited due to the need to distribute emergency aid during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many recipients did not have bank accounts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a> Bolsonaro claims PIX caused bankers to lose over R$20 billion annually due to the elimination of TED and DOC transaction fees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a> He also suggested it helped reduce crime by reducing cash circulation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>

#### Administrative Spending and Taxation
Bolsonaro claimed his government was the first since re-democratization to reduce administrative spending, specifically by revoking around 20,000 commission-based positions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a> He stated that his administration also reduced the IPI (Industrialized Products Tax) by 30% for over 4,000 products and zeroed import taxes on various items, including solar energy equipment and video games. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>

## Infrastructure Development
Bolsonaro highlighted several infrastructure projects completed during his term.

### Bridge Construction
One notable project mentioned was the Abunã Bridge at the tip of Rondônia, providing access to Acre over the Madeira River, replacing a ferry system. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a> This project significantly reduced travel times and costs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:37">[01:46:37]</a>

### International Connections via Itaipu
The Itaipu Binacional hydroelectric dam generated surplus funds that were used for regional development projects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a> These included:
*   Duplication of a highway in Foz do Iguaçu (BR-469). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:36">[02:08:36]</a>
*   Extension of the Foz do Iguaçu airport runway by 600 meters. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:26">[02:08:26]</a>
*   Construction of the Second International Bridge connecting Foz do Iguaçu to Paraguay. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:40">[02:08:40]</a>
*   Another international bridge connecting Porto Murtinho (Mato Grosso do Sul) to Carmelo Peralta (Paraguay). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:46">[02:08:46]</a>
These projects aimed to boost tourism and cross-border trade. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:31">[02:08:31]</a>

### Regional Development
Funds from Itaipu also supported small-scale projects in over 50 municipalities around the Itaipu Lake. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:54">[02:08:54]</a> Plans for fish farming (aquaculture) in the lake, potentially increasing Brazil's fish production by 20%, were also discussed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>

### São Paulo Infrastructure Initiatives
São Paulo Governor Tarcísio de Freitas mentioned several infrastructure initiatives in his state:
*   **Land Regularization:** Efforts to regularize land in Pontal do Paranapanema, a region previously dominated by the MST (Landless Workers' Movement). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:50">[02:34:50]</a> This, he stated, led to political gains in municipal elections. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:01">[02:35:01]</a>
*   **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs):** São Paulo is pursuing PPPs for new schools, aiming to create 35,000 new vacancies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:36">[02:35:36]</a>
*   **Sabesp Privatization:** The privatization of Sabesp (São Paulo's basic sanitation company) is being pursued and has seen legal victories in the Supreme Federal Court. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:47">[02:35:47]</a>
*   **Santos-Guarujá Tunnel:** An agreement was made with the federal government for São Paulo to lead the construction of the Santos-Guarujá tunnel, a project awaited for a century. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:39">[02:36:39]</a> This arrangement leverages São Paulo's ability to provide collateral and legislative authorization faster than the federal government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:48">[02:36:48]</a>
*   **Barreiro Bridge:** An initiative to complete the Barreiro Bridge, which will facilitate the passage of the VLT (Light Rail Transit) to São Vicente's continental area. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>

## Agricultural Policy
Bolsonaro criticized the current government's approach to agriculture, citing a cut in the agricultural budget and crop plan. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:29">[01:44:29]</a> He noted that the current government allocated R$750 million to the MST, while calling agriculture "fascist." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a> He also mentioned the current government's intent to "reactivate Red April," which he interpreted as a negative signal to the agricultural sector. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:58">[01:44:58]</a>

Under his government, Bolsonaro stated they issued 420,000 definitive or provisional land titles, aiming to strengthen land ownership and reduce the influence of the MST. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a> They also allowed rural residents to carry their weapons throughout their property perimeter, rather than just inside their homes, with parliamentary support. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>

## Environmental Policies
Bolsonaro's administration emphasized Brazil's existing environmental preservation efforts, stating that 2/3 of Brazil's territory is preserved. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:09">[03:04:09]</a> He expressed a desire to create a tax on NGOs, alleging that the majority work against Brazil's interests. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:19">[03:04:19]</a> He cited examples of NGOs discouraging photographic records in indigenous areas and opposing the exploration of mineral wealth in indigenous reserves, such as the Yanomami and Raposa Serra do Sol, which he claimed are rich in minerals and water resources. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:50">[03:04:50]</a>

He also criticized what he called the "idiots" who ended the "firefighter ox" program in the Pantanal, which involved cattle grazing to prevent the accumulation of dry organic matter that could fuel wildfires. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:53">[03:07:53]</a> He claimed that wildfires and deforestation increased under the current government compared to his own. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:29">[03:07:29]</a>

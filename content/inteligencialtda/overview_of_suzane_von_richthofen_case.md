The case of Suzane von Richthofen is a [[highprofile_crime_cases_in_Brazil | high-profile crime case in Brazil]] that continues to attract significant public and media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. She was convicted for orchestrating the murder of her own parents in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Background and The Crime

Suzane von Richthofen, along with her boyfriend Daniel Cravinhos and his brother Cristian Cravinhos, was involved in the murder of her parents, Manfred and Marisia von Richthofen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. The crime, which caused national commotion due to its brutality, involved the murder of her parents for inheritance and financial reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:06">[02:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:06">[02:10:06]</a>.

The idea to kill the parents stemmed from Daniel and Suzane's desire for a future free of her parents' existence and with their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:33">[02:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>. They reportedly planned the crime for two years, even rehearsing different methods like cutting a brake cable or setting fire to the farm with her parents inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:30">[02:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:36">[02:12:36]</a>. Ultimately, they decided to use a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:53">[02:12:53]</a>.

A key moment leading to the crime was when Suzane's mother discovered Suzane's continued relationship with Daniel, despite her having said they separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>. This discovery led to a discussion where the father made threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:58">[02:22:58]</a>. The mother left a note on Suzane's car windshield saying "I caught you," which triggered the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:02">[02:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:07">[02:23:07]</a>.

### Daniel and Cristian Cravinhos' Involvement
Daniel Cravinhos, Suzane's boyfriend, was deeply in love with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:11">[02:19:11]</a>. The idea of killing her parents was a manipulation game orchestrated by Suzane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:50">[02:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:19">[02:19:19]</a>. Daniel created a weapon by putting epoxy on a French hand tool to make it more lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:44">[02:20:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:51">[02:20:51]</a>.

Cristian Cravinhos initially refused to participate in the crime, warning that they would be caught as they were not professional criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:55">[02:17:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:02">[02:18:02]</a>. He also threatened to tell his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:04">[02:18:04]</a>. However, Daniel convinced Cristian, telling him that he wouldn't be able to commit the crime alone and that he would do it anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>. Cristian claimed he participated "for love" of his brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:57">[02:21:57]</a>. As a condition for his involvement, Daniel and Suzane offered Cristian all valuables from the house after simulating a robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:30">[02:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>. Cristian took R$5,000, R$8,000, and 2,000 euros, along with jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>.

## Family Dynamics and Psychology

Suzane was raised in a very cold and emotionally distant way by her parents, who were distant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:53">[02:21:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:55">[02:21:55]</a>. They did not hug or kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:53">[02:13:53]</a>. Suzane revealed that the first time her mother hugged her was when she was 18, after her mother discovered her husband's infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:05">[02:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:17">[02:14:17]</a>. Suzane found this hug very touching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:26">[02:14:26]</a>. She also explicitly told a friend that she did not want to be hugged because she had never experienced affectionate hugs from her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:05">[02:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:27">[02:15:27]</a>.

Psychological reports on Suzane indicated she was manipulative, highly seductive, and had "camouflaged aggression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:22">[01:29:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:24">[01:29:24]</a>. She is considered cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:33">[02:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:39">[02:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:45">[02:04:45]</a>. Psychologists believe she has a degree of manipulation and seduction so high that she can even manipulate evaluators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:29">[02:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:32">[02:05:32]</a>.

During psychological assessments, Suzane's responses revealed a self-centered regret, focusing on how the crime destroyed her own life, opportunities, and her brother's life, rather than the lives of her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>. She later adapted her answers in subsequent tests after understanding how she had failed previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>.

The Rorschach test, a projective psychological test using inkblots, was used to assess Suzane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:14">[01:46:14]</a>. Suzane's responses included seeing "skeleton jaws" and "a calyx, a flower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:58">[01:51:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Her assessment concluded she is narcissistic and self-centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:09">[01:58:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>. Psychologists stated that she possesses "camouflaged aggression" and could commit another crime depending on environmental pressures and demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:43">[01:58:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:57">[01:58:57]</a>.

Daniel Cravinhos, in contrast, showed immediate remorse after the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:47">[02:00:47]</a>. He reportedly knelt, petted the victim's head, and repeatedly asked for forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>. During crime reconstruction, Daniel was emotionally destabilized, crying and almost unable to stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:13">[02:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:17">[02:01:17]</a>. Suzane, however, remained cold and unshaken at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:33">[02:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:55">[02:01:55]</a>. The delegate leading the investigation noted he never saw a tear from her, even during her confession or under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:09">[02:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.

## Legal and Media Interactions

Suzane has been involved in several [[manipulation_and_legal_battles_involving_suzane_von_richthofen | manipulation and legal battles involving Suzane von Richthofen]]. She sued TV Globo because they showed her psychological exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. She also sued the state, claiming it did not protect her as a prisoner, demanding protection for her image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Suzane also attempted to prevent the publication of a book about her case, claiming it would damage her image, even before knowing its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. She lost this case because it constituted prior censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Her claims of a damaged image were seen as an "inversion of values" given the brutality of her crime and the national commotion it caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Suzane previously received 120,000 reais for an interview with Gugu Liberato, which led to a discussion on whether "crime pays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This highlights the ongoing debate about the monetization of true crime stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

After the crime, Suzane, Daniel, and Cristian were arrested and confessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. The police investigations were thorough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:03">[02:02:03]</a>. The confessions were detailed, providing a clear narrative of the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. However, when it came to court, their lawyers presented more "flowery and romantic" narratives to reduce the sentence or prevent aggravating factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. This involved portraying Suzane as a victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.

### Prison Life and Relationships
After her conviction, Suzane was transferred to various penitentiaries, including Tremembé and Rio Claro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>. In prison, she became emotionally involved with a cellmate named Luciana Hostel, whose brother, Rogério Olberg, later became Suzane's ex-fiancé <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This relationship was primarily for financial reasons, as the Olberg family would host Suzane during her temporary exits from prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

During her time in prison, Suzane was described as manipulating those around her, including prison officers and even a prosecutor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>. She even made an Orkut profile using a director's computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:14">[02:50:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:18">[02:50:18]</a>. She has also gone through various religious phases, including Lutheranism, Catholicism, Spiritualism, Candomblé, and Evangelicalism, often aligning with whatever was convenient at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:56">[01:36:56]</a>.

Suzane reportedly was "haunted" by the ghost of her mother in jail, a claim she made in psychological reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>. She also faced threats from a prisoner belonging to a satanic sect, who claimed to be an "emissary of the devil" sent to kill her because she killed her parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:29">[02:46:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:32">[02:46:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:25">[02:48:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:30">[02:48:30]</a>. This led to a rebellion among prisoners who wanted to kill Suzane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:39">[02:48:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:41">[02:48:41]</a>.

## Public Perception and Reintegration
Upon her release, Suzane has been met with mixed public reactions. Some people applauded her upon her exit from jail, symbolizing a "welcome to freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:25">[01:33:25]</a>. However, there's also public outrage at the idea of her reintegration into society given the nature of her crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

The public has a right to follow the execution of her sentence, as she committed a crime against society and was judged by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[01:41:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>. There is no "law of forgetfulness" in Brazil for such [[notable_crime_cases_and_investigations | notable crime cases and investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:56">[01:41:56]</a>.

## Comparison to other [[true_crime_case_studies | true crime case studies]]
Suzane's case is often compared to other [[highprofile_crime_cases_in_Brazil | high-profile crime cases in Brazil]], such as the [[details_of_the_elise_matsunaga_case | Elise Matsunaga Case]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. Both women committed violent crimes and received significant media attention. The public debate around whether such individuals should tell their stories or benefit financially from them is common to both cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Books and Films
Several books and films have been made about Suzane's case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. Films released about the case often divide audiences, with questions about their adherence to reality and their focus on the "who manipulated who" dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:14">[02:41:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:19">[02:41:19]</a>. Critics argue that these films often miss key aspects like the detailed [[crime_scene_investigation | police investigation]] and the period between the crime and the trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:01">[02:46:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:25">[02:49:25]</a>.

A book about Suzane is described as an unauthorized biography, drawing from documents, interviews with cellmates, family members, and psychological reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a>. The book emphasizes the importance of understanding the criminal's journey and motivations rather than merely focusing on the shocking nature of the crime itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. These narratives aim to delve into the "private world" of criminals to understand their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:49">[01:37:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:16">[01:38:16]</a>.

From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

Biblical prophecies are understood to be unfolding in the present day, especially those relating to the end times. The book of [[interpretations_of_revelation | Revelation]] is unique among the 66 books of the Bible, as it begins with a blessing for those who read and keep its commandments, encouraging a lack of fear for legitimate Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.

## Current Fulfillment of Prophecies

Current global events, such as pandemics, famines, tsunamis, and earthquakes, are seen as fulfillments of prophecies mentioned in Matthew Chapter 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. Jesus warned that these events are merely the "beginning of sorrows," not the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>. This period of "Principle of Pain" is considered a training ground for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

## Figures and Events in End Times Prophecy

### The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
The book of Revelation describes four horsemen, representing various aspects of the end times:
*   **White Horse (Antichrist)**: The first horseman is on a white horse, symbolizing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. He holds a bow without arrows, indicating that he will initially bring a false peace through his oratory, leading to sudden destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.
*   **Red Horse**: The second horseman is on a red horse, signifying war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.
*   **Other Horsemen**: The third and fourth horsemen are also part of this progression, with the fourth being "Death" on a pale horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a>.

### The False Prophet and the Eighth King
[[interpretations_of_revelation | Revelation]] 17 speaks of an "eighth king" who will be a false prophet, supporting the Antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. This figure is associated with the succession of popes after the Lateran Treaty of February 11, 1929, which granted the Vatican state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on February 11, 2013, the same date as the treaty, is seen as a significant sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. The upcoming "eighth Pope" is expected to be numbered 157 (which sums to 6+6+6), and will provide crucial support to the Antichrist, making his claims believable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>.

### The Return of the Jewish People
The return of the Jewish people to Israel and Jerusalem being recognized as its capital are considered significant signs of the times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>. The preparation for the rebuilding of the Temple by institutions like the Temple Institute is also highlighted as a prophetic fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.

### War and Biological Weapons
Future wars are predicted to be biological, using viruses to preserve city infrastructure while causing casualties, unlike nuclear or chemical warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. These biological weapons are believed to be developed to coerce populations into accepting measures like vaccines and becoming more submissive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

## Prophetic Calendar and Events

Satanism is believed to have its own calendar, which aligns with prophetic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>. For instance, a specific satanic ceremony was planned for October 31st, 2006, where one of "the nine" (a high-ranking satanist) visited Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>.

## Debated Interpretations

### Tribulation Period
There are different [[different_interpretations_of_eschatology_and_end_times | interpretations of biblical prophecies and the end times]] regarding the tribulation period. Some believe in "pretribulationism," where the church is raptured before the tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:13">[03:14:13]</a>. Others believe the church will go through the first half of the tribulation (three and a half years), which is considered more plausible, as faith needs to be tested by fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:43">[03:14:43]</a>. The current period is seen as the "beginning of sorrows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:01">[03:15:01]</a>.

### Second Coming of Christ
The second coming of Christ is expected at the end of the tribulation period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:05">[03:17:05]</a>. This is sometimes referred to as a "secret rapture," where individuals disappear, followed by Christ's visible return to gather his bride (the church) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:13">[03:17:13]</a>.

## Avoiding Fear
Despite these prophecies, the emphasis is on not living in fear if one is a legitimate Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>. Individuals are encouraged to live calmly and observe the signs, just as Joseph in Egypt was given a strategy by God to prepare for famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Strengthening faith helps overcome fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>.

> [!info] The Power of God
> The power of God is considered stronger than magic, preventing magic from having results if one lives a life "straight before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. A "curse without cause finds no landing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This divine protection acts like armor, though "holes" in this armor (such as pride, arrogance, greed, or envy) can allow negative influences to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

> A tripod of spiritual life includes prayer, worship, and knowledge of God's word, which generates faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Forgiveness is crucial, as holding onto unforgiveness can harm one's physical and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. It's not a single mistake that opens the door to negative influences, but a "sequence of errors" in one's conscious life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

## Modern Interpretations and Speculations

### Genetic Engineering and DNA Alterations
Some interpretations suggest that fallen angels, having learned from their past actions (like generating giants in Genesis 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>), now employ genetic engineering to create people with biological alterations that are not outwardly noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:38">[02:27:38]</a>. This could involve manipulating DNA to produce anomalies that are not obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>.

### Vaccine and Mark of the Beast
The development of a "super vaccine" by figures like Bill Gates, intended to immunize against major pandemics, is speculated to involve a stamping technology. This invisible stamp, detectable by an application (and curiously containing a substance called "luciferase"), would serve as a passport for travel and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. Refusal to accept this would lead to exclusion from commercial networks, mirroring the biblical prophecy of not being able to buy or sell without "the mark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. This is seen as a way to prepare the population for submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.

### The Antichrist's Identity
The Antichrist is believed to be currently alive and in training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>. The identity of the Antichrist is a closely guarded secret within certain circles, as revealing it would remove the opportunity for that person to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:20">[03:11:20]</a>.

## Caution Against Misinterpretations
It is important to differentiate between genuine [[biblical_prophecies_and_eschatology | biblical prophecies and eschatology]] and fabricated stories or misinterpretations often spread by charlatans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:50">[02:53:50]</a>. False doctrines can deceive the vulnerable, leading them away from faith or causing harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:06">[02:54:06]</a>.

> False doctrines are compared to poisoned water, which may appear to quench thirst but ultimately cause harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:02">[02:32:02]</a>.

> The Bible is said to warn against "the doctrine of demons," which often involves taking texts out of context to deceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:51">[02:34:51]</a>. If one doubts the truth, the devil has already won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:01">[02:35:01]</a>.

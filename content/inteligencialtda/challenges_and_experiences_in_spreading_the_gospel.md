Spreading the gospel involves various challenges and experiences, from personal struggles to the broader impact of divine calling and spiritual warfare. Modern evangelization also increasingly utilizes new media and faces unique [[challenges_and_experiences_with_evangelization_through_media | challenges and experiences with evangelization through media]].

## The Evangelistic Calling and Early Challenges

The journey of spreading the gospel often begins with a personal calling, as described by one speaker who felt a divine summons rather than a self-generated idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This calling is seen as a way to help as many people as possible, even if it starts with saving just one individual, who can then influence many others like a seed with hidden potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Initial Hurdles in Media Evangelization
In 2013, early attempts at online evangelization faced significant discouragement due to low viewership, with videos only getting about 50 views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The speaker stopped for two years before returning in 2015, by which point he had around 3,000 YouTube subscribers and 1,000 Instagram followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Despite growing to six million followers on Facebook, it is acknowledged that growing an online presence for evangelization is more difficult today than it was in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

A key [[challenges_and_experiences_with_evangelization_through_media | challenge in media evangelization]] is overcoming the inner voice of self-doubt and the difficulty of connecting with people through a screen compared to in-person preaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Spiritual Warfare and Personal Transformation

The process of evangelization and personal conversion often involves intense [[spiritual_battles | spiritual battles]]. The speaker recounts a period of deep distress and thoughts of death after a negative encounter at a Candombl√© center, to the point of writing a farewell letter to his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:50">[02:04:50]</a>.

### Confronting Demonic Influence
Encounters with spiritual phenomena, such as seeing what was believed to be an angel during a vigil, can be powerful but also confusing. Conversely, witnessing what appeared to be a "wizard" after conversion was quickly identified as an enemy influence, prompting the speaker to rebuke it in Jesus' name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

In a small neighborhood church known for its focus on spiritual battles, the speaker witnessed people becoming demonized due to their previous involvement with practices like *terreiro* (Afro-Brazilian religious centers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>. Such experiences highlight the reality of spiritual opposition during evangelistic efforts, sometimes even manifesting as direct harassment like stones being thrown at the church door or mocking laughter from those possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

## The Nature of Christian Conversion and Evangelization

Conversion is seen as a commitment, a public declaration in the spiritual world that one now belongs to Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:42">[03:15:42]</a>. This decision signifies a spiritual pact, making the individual a target for the enemy, who resists losing a soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:11">[03:16:11]</a>.

### Law vs. Grace in Evangelism
The speaker emphasizes that salvation is not earned through human effort or adherence to religious laws but through God's grace via Jesus' sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:17">[01:51:17]</a>. The Law's purpose was to reveal sin, demonstrating humanity's inability to save itself and the need for a Savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:50">[02:04:50]</a>. Evangelism, therefore, should begin by highlighting the Law to expose sin before presenting the grace available through Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.

Preaching a "light gospel" that only emphasizes "Jesus loves you" without explaining the depth of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:22">[02:10:22]</a>.

## Challenges for Christians and Leaders
Even after conversion, Christians face ongoing [[modern_challenges_to_faith_and_spiritual_integrity | challenges to faith and spiritual integrity]]. The "spiritual battle" is continuous, and new converts may experience greater struggles as the devil attempts to remind them of their past sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:56">[02:14:56]</a>.

### Maturity and Accountability
Spiritual leaders, particularly pastors, carry a heavy responsibility over people's spiritual lives. It is a burden that can lead to depression if not genuinely called by God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:29">[02:27:29]</a>. A pastor must have good conduct, knowledge, and be prepared for the constant spiritual battle and potential retaliation from the enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:12">[02:28:12]</a>. New converts are generally not prepared to be spiritual leaders and need time to mature through many experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:32">[02:29:32]</a>.

The speaker highlights [[challenges_and_experiences_in_prostitution | territorial demons]] linked to specific sins like prostitution, emphasizing that they are highly organized and work to perpetuate sin and imprison individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Personal Temptations
One example of a personal challenge faced is the temptation to return to "the world" (secular life), especially when listening to secular music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:11">[02:39:11]</a>. While not all secular things are inherently bad, anything that consistently draws a person away from God or becomes more important than their relationship with Him is considered detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:01">[02:41:01]</a>.

### The Role of Rules vs. Guidance
The speaker advises against strict, man-made rules that can hinder a person's joy and relationship with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:30">[02:43:30]</a>. Instead of rigid prohibitions, the focus should be on what nurtures one's walk with God, as "everything is lawful, but not everything is convenient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:37">[02:47:37]</a>. This includes decisions about entertainment, appearance (tattoos, cosmetic surgery), and daily activities. The aim is to avoid "embarrassments of this life" that hinder the "Christian race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a>.

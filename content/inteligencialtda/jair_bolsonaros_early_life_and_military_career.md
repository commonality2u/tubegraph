Jair Bolsonaro was born in 1955 and was raised in Novo Ribeiro, near Eldorado Paulista, SÃ£o Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. He studied in public schools, which he recalls as being very good at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

## Childhood and Family Life

Bolsonaro grew up in a large family, being one of seven siblings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. His father worked as a practical dentist, making dentures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. He describes his childhood as very healthy, despite lacking modern comforts like television or cell phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

Childhood activities included playing in the street barefoot, rollerblading, cart racing, and flying kites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. He also fished frequently, going three days a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. Some kids, including himself, took on part-time jobs like shining shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a> and delivering newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>, which he won a dispute for because he owned a bicycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:08]</a>. He learned to drive a tractor on a farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

## Military Career

At 15 years old, Bolsonaro developed a passion for the army after seeing uniformed personnel in his city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. He was the first in his family to join the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. He successfully passed the competitive exams for military schools, which covered subjects like Portuguese, mathematics, and general knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>. During his studies, he often used a public library and encyclopedias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

He spent a total of 15 years in the Brazilian Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. During this time, he was an active athlete, participating in basketball, football, and military pentathlon (shooting, track, running, swimming with obstacle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. He was considered a good athlete in the Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

His military career offered a clear path, with promotion to the rank of Colonel being practically guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. He served on the border in Niak, Matruga do Sul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. Here, he became the head of the plant, managing diesel motors, and served as an artillery lieutenant, often spending weekends repairing broken engines with soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.

His entry into [[Political journey and presidency of Brazil | politics]] was unintentional, stemming from a statement he made in a magazine in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. As an active military member, making press declarations was prohibited, leading to disciplinary action and his decision to enter [[Political journey and presidency of Brazil | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.

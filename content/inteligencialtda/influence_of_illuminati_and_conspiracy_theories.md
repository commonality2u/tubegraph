The concept of a [[global_elite_and_its_influence | Global Elite]] working behind the scenes to manipulate world events is a central tenet of various conspiracy theories discussed. These theories often point to an orchestrated plan for a "New World Order" and the eventual rise of an Antichrist figure [00:08:05].

## Origins of the New World Order Plan

The idea of a long-term plan for a New World Order, culminating in a single global government, currency, and religion under an Antichrist, is said to require centuries of work and involvement from individuals across all societal sectors, including the financial system [00:08:25]. This agenda is believed to be orchestrated by a hidden [[global_elite_and_its_influence | elite]] [00:08:49].

One source for this theory is an ex-Satanist named Doc Marx, who wrote a book titled "The Secret of Illuminates" [00:07:09]. According to Marx, in 1870, Albert Pike, considered a "pope of Freemasonry" and author of "The Book of Morals and Dogmas," received a vision from his spirit guides [00:07:42]. This vision allegedly revealed how the New World Order needed to be established [00:08:05]. This project was initially shared only with the "summit" of his people [00:09:02].

## Predicted World Wars and the Hegelian Dialectic

Doc Marx's revelation predicts three world wars necessary for the New World Order to be established [00:09:34]. These wars are described as being on a global scale [00:09:45]. The underlying concept for these events is the Hegelian dialectic: "thesis battling against antithesis so that for the synthesis to arise" [00:09:52].

*   **First World War (Antithesis Establishment)**: The objective was to overthrow the Russian Tsarist government, partly because the Tsar opposed a Central Bank in Russia, a project favored by the [[global_elite_and_its_influence | elite]] [00:10:28]. The vision allegedly stated that the new nation replacing the Tsarist regime needed to be communist, atheist, and militarist [00:10:54]. Notably, this vision was received 22 years after Karl Marx wrote his Communist Manifesto [00:11:02]. It is claimed that Vladimir Lenin received financial support from the world's banking elite for the communist revolution, as detailed in the book "Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution" [00:11:24].
*   **Second World War (Strengthening the Antithesis)**: The objective was to strengthen this new communist nation (the Soviet Union) into a superpower [00:12:25]. This power would then be used to destroy other nations and religions [00:12:32]. The transcript asserts that events in the Soviet Union, including the suppression of freedoms and severe persecution of all religions (Christian, Jewish, and Orthodox), followed this plan [00:12:37]. Communism's foundational premise, based on Marxism, is atheism, where the state, not God, is paramount [00:14:23].
*   **Cold War (Thesis vs. Antithesis)**: The First World War established the "antithesis" (communism) against the "thesis" (capitalism) [00:14:46]. The Second World War empowered Russia to become a superpower [00:14:34]. The resulting conflict between communism (Soviet Union) and capitalism (United States) was the Cold War, which divided the planet [00:15:07]. This ideological division, leading to extreme polarization (extreme right vs. extreme left), is seen as a deliberate strategy to keep people divided, preventing awareness of a larger plan [00:15:27]. This division includes pitting "proletarian against businessman," "black against white," "straight against homo," and "Arab against Jew" [00:15:41].
*   **Third World War (Leading to Synthesis)**: Doc Marx, following Albert Pike's vision, predicted that the third world war would begin between Jews and Arabs (or Islam) [00:16:12]. This prediction was made in 1870, before Israel was a state [00:16:37]. From the "smoke and ashes of the chaos" of this third war, a "super man," a leader formed by the elite, would emerge to offer economic and social solutions, bringing peace and ending the war â€“ this figure being the Antichrist [00:17:12]. The current conflict in Israel is seen as the "scenery drawing on the horizon" for this prediction [00:17:28].

## Satanism, Occult Practices, and the Illuminati Lineage

### Historical Roots of Occultism
The speaker delves into the [[history_of_occultism_and_spiritual_beliefs | history of occultism and spiritual beliefs]], tracing back to the time before the Great Flood, noting "prediluvian pyramids with symbols of the all-seeing eye," which is identified as a Luciferian symbol [02:27:31]. This ancient Luciferian cult is described as seducing humanity by promising to "recover that 100% intelligence" lost after the biblical Fall, through "occult practices" [02:28:07].

These practices are said to involve the worship of "unclean spirits" and "bloodshed," as blood is considered "the currency in spiritual region because it is in the blood life" [02:28:23]. After the flood, Nimrod, Noah's great-grandson, is said to have resurrected Luciferian cults and founded Babylon, described as "the cradle of religions and of the idolatry of the planet" [03:00:17]. This Babylonian cult, involving sun and moon worship, is theorized to have spread globally, changing names but retaining its essence (e.g., Isis and Osiris in Egypt) [03:11:16]. These practices are interpreted as worship of the "masculine aspects of Lucifer and feminine aspects of Lucifer" [03:13:38].

### The Illuminati's Origins and Beliefs
The Illuminati are presented as originating from specific historical movements:

*   **Sabbatism**: Founded by Sabata Evi in 1626, a Kabbalist Rabbi who claimed to be the Messiah [02:54:27]. This sect allegedly considered the God of the scriptures as evil and Lucifer as good, reversing traditional values [02:54:52]. It preached that biblical commandments were no longer mandatory and that "God now allowed everything" [02:55:15], including incest, pedophilia, and other traditionally forbidden sexual practices [02:55:54]. Followers were instructed to "practice sins in order to prepare a Redemption" [02:56:07].
*   **Francoism**: Founded by Jacob Frank about 100 years after Sabbatism, this was an underground sect whose adherents publicly followed Jewish law but secretly rejected it and dedicated themselves to forbidden sexual practices [02:56:13].

According to the theory, the Illuminati were born from these movements [02:56:42]. Adam Weishaupt is cited as founding the secret society of the Illuminati six years after Francoism [02:56:47]. Sabbatarian and Francoist followers subsequently joined the Illuminati [02:56:56]. They believe that Sabata Evi was the true Messiah and his soul transmigrated to the "dynasty of the 13 families that would be the 13 families that control the system" [02:57:11]. These families are described as operating "behind the curtains" [02:57:21].

### The Role of the Rothschilds and Control of Information
The Rothschild family (originally "Meer ell") is implicated as one of these controlling dynasties, specifically in controlling the world's finances [02:58:26]. The name "Rothschild" ("red shield" in German) is linked to a red shield with six points (a hexagram), which is described as a symbol used in Satanism [02:58:50]. This family, through financial control, allegedly acquired a monopoly over media, information, and entertainment industries, including film, radio, news agencies, and even school textbooks [02:59:41]. This allows them to "rewrite the history" and "shape thinking worldwide" according to their desired culture [03:00:04].

### Predictive Programming
A key element of these conspiracy theories is "predictive programming," where media (drawings, books, theater, cinema, music) is used to "advertise future events" [02:09:06]. This is exemplified by:
*   **Thanos in The Avengers**: The character's goal of reaping half of all living beings is seen as programming the idea of world population reduction, an alleged agenda of the "Antichrist government" [02:09:31]. The idea is subtly conveyed that this reduction is "for the good of humanity" [02:10:11].
*   **The Simpsons**: The animated series is claimed to have made "predictions about everything" [02:10:54]. This is interpreted not as genuine prophecy, but as evidence of a hidden agenda, demonstrating control by those "in command" who "make that happen to show people their followers who look how we are in command" [02:11:03].
*   **Xuxa's robot predictions**: An old TV show segment where a robot makes optimistic predictions for 2023 is shown as a stark contrast to reality, implying a deliberate misleading narrative [02:11:37].

This **[[influence_and_impact_of_media | media influence]]** is considered a tool for subtly shaping public perception and preparing the world for desired outcomes [02:08:49].

## Cultural Revolution and Spiritual Degradation

The 1968 student protests, particularly the one in Paris, are presented as a pivotal moment orchestrated by leftist and communist leaders [01:56:54]. This "cultural revolution" influenced young people globally [01:57:17].

### Degradation of Morals
This period marked a "gradual degradation of morals" that transformed Western culture, leading to an increase in "iniquity" and a "cooling of love" [01:57:38]. "Iniquity" is defined as "disrespect for the right to right, to disrespect order and related criteria," including atheism, rebellion against the law, contempt, and direct opposition to God [01:56:26].

*   **Rupture with Christianity**: From 1968 onwards, there was a "massive rupture" with [[influence_of_christianity | Christianity]] in Europe and North America [02:00:38]. Traditionally Christian values (family, morality) were "literally thrown away" [02:01:19].
*   **Woodstock and the Age of Aquarius**: The Woodstock festival in 1969 is seen as a representation of this "countercultural era" [02:03:34]. Its promotion of the "Age of Aquarius" symbolized the end of one era (associated with Christianity) and the beginning of a new one, characterized by "mysticism" and "new world order" concepts [02:01:41].
*   **Drug Use**: This counterculture promoted drug use (LSD, synthetic drugs, heroin) as a way to "expand the mind" [02:04:08]. This was influenced by intellectuals like Harvard professor Timothy Leary, who advocated drugs for perceiving the world better [02:04:00]. This programming led to millions of young people being "cut down by drugs" and long-term societal issues [02:04:40].
*   **Sexual Revolution**: German psychiatrists allegedly influenced the "sexual revolution" with the idea that sexual repression caused war, leading to the motto "make love, not war" [02:05:21]. This promoted "free sex" and a "sexual moral degradation," replacing the idea of sex as a pure act between loving people with "depravity and orgies" [02:05:31].

### Influence of Herbert Marcuse and the Frankfurt School
Herbert Marcuse, a philosopher from the Frankfurt School, is identified as a key figure [02:05:55]. The Frankfurt School is described as being created to "destroy Western culture" by attacking capitalism and the religious dimension of life and tradition [02:06:01]. This was an adaptation of original Marxism, aiming to change culture through "messages, language, and ideas" rather than armed revolution [02:06:30]. Marcuse is credited with implanting communism in the United States, realizing that American proletarians were too content to rebel [02:07:24]. He then advocated using "outsiders" â€“ students, artists, intellectuals, and influencers â€“ as "transforming agents" [02:08:01].

### Music and Subversion
Music is highlighted as a powerful instrument for social transformation and the propagation of ideas [02:08:37].
*   **The Beatles**: Influenced by the "Beatniks" counterculture movement, The Beatles are presented as incarnating "socialist ideas" [02:11:51]. John Lennon's song "Imagine" is cited as describing the New World Order, envisioning a world without borders or religion, and effectively entering the "collective subconscious" [02:13:05].
*   **Punk Movement**: Emerging in the 1970s, the punk movement expressed "revolt" against bourgeois and capitalist values [02:16:07]. Its "peace and love without Christ" message is symbolized by a broken cross [02:15:31]. Punk bands like Dead Kennedys (with songs like "Holiday in Cambodia" about Pol Pot's massacres) and Sex Pistols (attacking the monarchy) propagated themes of pessimism, wrath, hate, and rebellion [02:17:18]. Even children's songs are cited, like "Old Santa Claus, pig capitalist, I want to kill you," as examples of promoting hatred for capitalism [02:19:05].
*   **Heavy Metal**: Introduced Satanism through music, bringing "worship to Satan" closer to young people and breaking societal paradigms [02:21:34].

This **[[influence_of_esoteric_concepts_in_pop_culture | influence of esoteric concepts in pop culture]]** through music and arts is seen as designed to foster contempt for parental authority ("my father doesn't know nothing, he is outdated") and increase iniquity [02:21:55]. The rise in divorces and the "epidemic of sadness" and depression in modern society are attributed to this cultural revolution that subverted traditional values and principles [02:22:48]. The spiritual void results from seeking satisfaction in material goods rather than in a relationship with God [02:23:49].

## UN Agenda 2030 and Global Governance
The United Nations (UN) is depicted as exceeding its original mandate of avoiding conflicts after World War II [02:33:35]. Over decades, the UN has strengthened, creating "fronts to talk about all areas, all segments" including health and education, and determining how nations should operate [02:34:00]. This expansion is viewed as a pathway to a "Unified world government" [02:34:50]. The UN Agenda 2030 is seen as part of this plan, aimed at unifying nations around the UN's purposes [02:35:16].

## Future Catastrophes and Return to God
Doc Marx's occult predictions for the beginning of the third world war include simultaneous global catastrophes: earthquakes (e.g., in Los Angeles), hurricanes, nuclear war between Koreas, famine, epidemics, and pandemics [02:29:46]. These events are theorized to be "programmed" and manipulated through technology, such as weather manipulation and earthquake creation [02:31:11].

These alarming events are presented as signs for humanity to reflect on their mortality and "return to God" and "repent of sins" [02:31:33]. This is framed as a crucial moment for humanity to seek a relationship with God through Jesus Christ, which is presented as the only way to find peace, complete oneself, and secure an eternal destiny beyond the coming tribulations [02:44:59].

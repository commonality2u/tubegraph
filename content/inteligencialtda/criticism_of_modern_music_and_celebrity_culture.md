The modern music landscape is characterized by a significant shift in audience engagement and the rise of celebrity culture, often overshadowing artistic merit and deeply impacting fan behavior and the industry itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. This transformation is largely attributed to [[the_influence_of_technology_on_music_consumption | technological advancements]] and the pervasive influence of [[media_and_cultural_commentary | social media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## The Decline of Music's Importance and Quality

Music, once a transformative element in life, is now often reduced to background noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. The shift from physical media like vinyl LPs, which encouraged listening to complete albums as coherent stories, to digital files has diminished the immersive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

> "The idea of the record being a complete story... you listened to people listening to a song here, another one here, you don't understand what that disc represented... what was lost was the importance of music as a transformer as an element, life transformer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>

Modern audiences, especially younger generations, tend to treat music as a mere soundtrack for other activities, often skipping songs before they finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. This fragmented consumption hinders the development of "affective memory" associated with songs and specific life moments, unlike past generations who listened repeatedly until the music became deeply ingrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. This leads to a collective "mental retardation" where young people struggle to grasp fundamental concepts like sound transmission through physical media or the holistic nature of an album <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

The rise of instant access has also led to a decline in the perceived artistic quality of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. In the past, scarcity of physical records and the difficulty of acquiring imported music fostered a deep appreciation for each new discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Celebrity Culture

Modern culture often blurs the line between genuine success and mere fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. Success, in music, is defined by public acceptance and a consolidated career based on one's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. Fame, however, can be achieved through non-musical endeavors, trivial actions, or simply by "being a celebrity for being a celebrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

> "Success and doing it right, being successful is completely different from being famous... being successful is your job, you have a public acceptance and you have a base." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>

This shift has led to the trivialization of music content, with media portals prioritizing sensational celebrity news over artistic achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. Artists often prioritize image, costumes, choreography, and large stage productions over musical substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:07]</a>. While visual elements can enhance a performance, they should not replace a strong musical foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>. The use of playback in concerts by major artists like Michael Jackson and Madonna is cited as an example of this compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.

## Impact of Technology and Social Media

[[the_influence_of_technology_on_music_consumption | Technology]], particularly social media, has profoundly changed how music is consumed and how artists interact with their audience. The internet has made music readily available as files, leading to a focus on individual songs rather than albums as complete narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

Social media platforms have given a voice to "any imbecile," allowing anyone to offer an opinion, which has diluted meaningful [[dealing_with_criticism_and_feedback | criticism and feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>. This environment fosters a "collective dumbing down process" and a worrying trend of "collective mental retardation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>.

> "Any imbecile feels entitled to give an opinion now if you are going to follow this imbecile there you are as imbecile as." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>

The direct access to artists via social media has eroded the previous "distancing of the public from the artist," making artists seem less unattainable and more prone to public scrutiny for non-artistic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>. This hyper-connectedness encourages superficial interaction rather than deep engagement with the art itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

The rise of algorithms in streaming services, while seemingly helpful in suggesting new music, can also limit genuine discovery by tailoring suggestions based on existing preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Criticisms of Specific Genres and Artists

### Funk Carioca
Funk Carioca is criticized for its origins, which allegedly involve glorifying drug trafficking and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. While later attempts were made to sanitize it, the genre's initial themes included advocating for killing police officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. The use of terms like "community" for favelas by mainstream media like Rede Globo is seen as a disingenuous attempt to sanitize the perception of these areas and the music originating from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

### Greta Van Fleet
Greta Van Fleet is seen as "proof that every rocker has the restaurant that deserves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:51">[03:14:51]</a>. They are criticized as a "manufactured" band that "regurgitates" classic rock sounds, bordering on plagiarism, with a "hippie look" but lacking genuine artistic depth or originality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:08">[03:14:08]</a>. The band is described as a "pastiche" of Led Zeppelin, appealing to a "needy" segment of older rock fans who miss the "great bands of the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:18">[03:15:18]</a>. Their shows are also criticized for the vocalist's "unprofessional" stage presence, such as performing in "slippers and socks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:01">[03:15:01]</a>. In essence, Greta Van Fleet is summarized as "the Restart for rockers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:05">[03:16:05]</a>.

### Pop Artists and Reality TV Show Winners
Many modern pop artists are seen as lacking "musical background" and prioritizing superficial appeal over substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>. The success of reality TV show winners is often fleeting, as broadcasters are primarily interested in audience numbers during the show, not in developing long-term musical careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:53">[02:28:53]</a>. Winners often sign short-term contracts that tie them to the network for a limited period, after which they are on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:13">[02:53:13]</a>. These artists are also criticized for a lack of charisma and poor vocal performances, sometimes described as "gargling with a roller" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:28">[02:26:28]</a>.

### K-Pop
K-Pop groups are characterized as "manufactured" products, often consisting of a large number of members with dyed hair and "zero testosterone," designed to create a visual spectacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. These artists are subjected to immense pressure, undergoing rigorous training in "training centers" for years before debut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:35">[03:37:35]</a>. This intense environment is linked to a high rate of suicide among young K-Pop artists, unable to withstand the "industry of grinding animal meat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The music itself is dismissed as a "cheap and bad imitation" of older boy bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:35">[03:35:35]</a>.

## The Music Industry's Evolution

### Role of Record Labels
In the past, record companies acted as "mentors," taking bets on artists and financing their careers, including those who didn't sell many records, such as Chico Buarque or Caetano Veloso, by using profits from popular acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. Today, record labels have largely transformed into mere "distributors," with a focus on "artistic postgraduate studies" rather than nurturing raw talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

### Impact of MTV
MTV Brazil played a fundamental role in the success and "survival" of many Brazilian rock bands in the 80s and 90s, offering exposure through music videos and acoustic performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:11">[01:41:11]</a>. However, MTV's decline began when it "lost its identity" by incorporating non-musical programming like talk shows and reality shows, alienating its original music-focused audience and becoming a "concentration of delayed programs for the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:13">[01:44:13]</a>.

### Concert Industry Issues
A recent law allowing event organizers to not refund money for postponed shows is heavily criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Producers often indefinitely postpone events, knowing that if they officially cancel, they would be "obliged" to refund ticket money, including shipping fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This practice is seen as an "absurd impudence," exploiting consumers who are left with no recourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.

## Fan Behavior and Criticism

Modern fan culture often exhibits "blind loyalty," where fans are "unable to recognize that the idol makes mistakes" or that their work might be "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This leads to a collective "idiot sensation" where fans cannot objectively evaluate their idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

On social media, this translates into an inability to differentiate between professional and personal [[dealing_with_criticism_and_feedback | criticism and feedback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:46">[03:09:46]</a>. While criticism itself is inherently personal in terms of opinion, it is not an "attack on the person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:52">[03:10:52]</a>. The expectation for critics to be "impartial" is unrealistic, as all opinions are based on personal frameworks and require "solid arguments" rather than mere personal preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>.

The "cancel culture" phenomenon is also discussed, where individuals or artists are summarily dismissed based on perceived offenses or "fake news," often without a proper understanding of the context or a chance for redress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a>. This trend is seen as problematic, especially when it involves historical figures or complex narratives like that of Wilson Simonal, who was ostracized due to a "cancellation based in a fake news that the person himself victim created" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>.

The Brazilian population is described as racist, citing examples like Wilson Simonal and Erlon Chaves, who faced backlash for their relationships with white women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>. This deeply ingrained racism contributes to the ostracism of black artists, often based on superficial reasons rather than artistic merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:11">[02:27:11]</a>.

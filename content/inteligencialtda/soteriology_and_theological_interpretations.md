Soteriology is the doctrine that studies [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. In Brazil, and globally, the primary theological schools that interpret [[religious_texts_and_interpretations | salvation]] are Calvinism and Arminianism, though other positions like Molinism and Wesleyan Arminianism exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Unifying Principles

Both Calvinism and Arminianism are considered orthodox traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. They both believe the Bible is the inerrant and infallible word of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. The core of Christianity, which unites believers, is the belief in Christ as their Redeemer and Savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Differences in doctrinal interpretation, such as those between Calvinism and Arminianism, do not separate believers as brothers in Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

Both traditions agree that [[role_of_free_will_in_salvation_theology | salvation]] comes solely from God (a monergistic principle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. Man does not have the ability to save himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. The Holy Spirit is believed to open the heart of man and convince him of sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

## Calvinism

Calvinism, as a developed theological system, emphasizes [[biblical_prophecies_and_eschatology | God's sovereignty]] and predestination.

### Origin and Development
Calvinism saw a significant shift in the 17th century, focusing more intensely on the doctrine of predestination and election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This period, known as Protestant scholasticism, established election as the core of theological science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. John Calvin himself did not emphasize election as much in his *Institutes of the Christian Religion* as later Calvinists did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Jacob Arminius, originally a Calvinist and director of the University of Leiden, reacted against the rigorous aspects of predestination and election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. After Arminius died in 1609, his followers presented a document outlining their disagreements with Calvinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This led to the Synod of Dort (1618-1619), which established the "five points of Calvinism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### The Five Points of Calvinism (TULIP)
The five points of Calvinist soteriology, forming the acronym TULIP, are:
1.  **Total Depravity:** Man is so corrupted by sin that he cannot understand or desire holy things on his own, requiring God's action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Unconditional Election:** God chooses individuals for salvation freely, not based on any foreseen merit or action from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>. This choice is based on God's "good pleasure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:08">[02:59:08]</a>.
3.  **Limited Atonement:** Christ's death was for the elect only, not for all people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>. This means the death of Christ is effective only for those God has chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>.
4.  **Irresistible Grace:** God's grace, when extended to the elect, cannot be resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. God works in the elect's hearts to convince them of sin, righteousness, and judgment, leading them to believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.
5.  **Perseverance of the Saints:** Those chosen by God will persevere in faith and cannot lose their salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>. If someone apostatizes, it indicates they had a false or dead faith and were never truly elect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.

### Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility
Calvinism teaches that God has predetermined all things, including human behavior, desires, and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:59">[02:57:59]</a>. Every detail of life is under God's control and part of His decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:24">[02:59:24]</a>.

> [!quote] "His mind has to be the same as mine only that much greater is not God, who is unfathomable this here I have to look at this speak Lord I do not understand I am me I am a creature my God I am a being finite my my mind is finite my understanding is finite I can't harmonize this here with the condemnation that you applied to these people I I agree that you have hardened yourself you made these people go astray of your ways the Lord the Lord is the source of this here Christian Christian not only lists or Arminian agrees that our mind does not reach everything that Bible says it is impossible for our mind can't reconcile issues texts finally all these only in eternity we will know this these things you can't know now why I don't have answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>

Despite God's sovereignty, Calvinism maintains that man is fully responsible for his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. This creates a "theological tension" or "paradox" that is considered "insoluble and untouchable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>. Examples include:
*   God hardening Pharaoh's heart while Pharaoh is still responsible for his rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>.
*   The Assyrians being raised by God to destroy Israel but still being held guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.
*   Judas's betrayal being foreordained by God, yet Judas remains guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:12">[02:22:12]</a>.
*   The prophet Isaiah questioning why God makes people deviate from His paths and hardens their hearts, while God still condemns them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:55">[01:42:55]</a>.

Calvinists argue that God's knowledge of the future is not because He merely foresaw it, but because He determined and wrote it beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:39">[02:40:39]</a>.

> [!example] Biblical Support for Divine Determination
> *   Psalm 139:16: "Your eyes saw my substance, yet unformed; And in your book were written All the days that were formed for me, When as yet there were none of them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:10">[02:39:10]</a> This is interpreted to mean that God knows because He determined.
> *   2 Kings 19:25 (referring to Sennacherib): "Have you not heard long ago how I made it, And in ancient times that I formed it? Now I have brought it to pass, That you should be for crushing fortified cities into heaps of ruins." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:18">[02:40:18]</a> This indicates God planned events long ago and now brings them to pass.
> *   Matthew 17:27 (Jesus knowing about the coin in the fish's mouth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:10">[02:43:10]</a> and other examples show God's specific knowledge of future events, interpreted as His determination.

## Arminianism

Arminianism emerged in reaction to the more rigid aspects of Calvinism, particularly concerning predestination and atonement.

### Emphasis on Universal Love and Free Will
Arminianism strongly asserts that Jesus Christ died for all men, and God loves everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
> [!quote] "Jesus Christ died on the cross for all men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>
> "God loves everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>

This is supported by texts like Romans 11:32, which states God "has shut them all up in disobedience, that He might have mercy on all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:52">[02:32:52]</a>, and Hebrews 2:9, which says Jesus "tasted death for every man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:47">[02:41:47]</a>. The argument is that if the gospel is to be preached to "every creature," it must be a sincere and true offer of salvation for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:45">[02:46:45]</a>.

Arminianism defines free will as the freedom to make decisions without coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:20">[02:21:20]</a>. While Adam had full free will in Eden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:42">[02:21:42]</a>, after the Fall, human will is affected by sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:55">[02:16:55]</a>. However, Arminianism emphasizes that God's grace (prevenient grace) enables individuals to respond to the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:36">[02:18:36]</a>. This grace is extended to all who hear the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:48">[02:20:48]</a>.

> [!example] Biblical Support for Universal Atonement and Responsibility
> *   Romans 11:32: "For God has committed them all to disobedience, that He might have mercy on all." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:52">[02:32:52]</a>
> *   Hebrews 2:9: "But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:47">[02:41:47]</a>
> *   1 Timothy 2:4: "who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a>
> *   1 John 2:2: "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>
> *   Titus 2:11: "For the grace of God that brings [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]] has appeared to all men." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>
> *   Genesis 4:7 (God to Cain): "If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire is for you, but you should rule over it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a> This suggests Cain had the choice to change and be accepted.

Arminianism acknowledges election but interprets it through God's foreknowledge, meaning God chooses those He *foresees* will believe and persevere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:56">[03:10:56]</a>. God's omniscience means He knows the future because He *sees* it, not necessarily because He decreed every single event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:02]</a>.

> [!info] Monergism vs. Synergism
> *   **Monergism:** The belief that God is the sole agent in regeneration and [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]]. (Calvinist view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>
> *   **Synergism:** The belief that [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]] is a cooperative effort between God and man, where man cooperates with God's grace. (Arminian view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>
> *   2 Corinthians 6:1: "We are God's fellow workers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a> This is cited to support cooperation in [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]].

### Points of Contention for Arminianism
*   **Limited Atonement:** Arminians argue that if Christ only died for the elect, it implies Jesus does not love everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:16">[02:51:16]</a>. They believe God's love is part of His essence and extends to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:27">[02:52:27]</a>.
*   **Final Judgment:** Arminians argue that a final judgment would make no sense if individuals had no true choice and were predetermined to their fate, as it would imply God judges them for actions they could not avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.
*   **Order of Salvation (Ordo Salutis):** Arminians generally disagree with the classical Calvinist idea that regeneration (being born again) precedes belief. They believe prevenient grace enables belief, and regeneration follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:39">[02:52:39]</a>.

## Conclusion: Inscrutable Mind of God

Both sides ultimately acknowledge that there are aspects of God's nature and actions that are beyond human comprehension.

> [!info] The Inscrutable Mind
> When faced with apparent contradictions in scripture (e.g., God's sovereignty vs. human responsibility, universal love vs. creation of vessels of wrath), Calvinists respond by stating that God's mind is "unfathomable" and "inscrutable." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:53">[02:58:53]</a> These are "theological tensions" that cannot be reconciled by human logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. One must worship God's greatness rather than try to force a logical explanation that the Bible doesn't provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>.

> [!quote] "I don't understand these things are too much for I know that the Lord decrees all things. things you wrote the future nothing can frustrate your plans and your decrees the Lord when I create in Lord, I only believed because the Lord told me empowered through his spirit the Lord said let there be light for the darkness of my heart and heard light and I could see the glory of the Lord in the face of Christ and I I believe I see all this at the same time I see that you are loving, Lord love the world the Lord is love to you essence is love and at the same time I I see that you harden people I I see that you make vessels of Wrath I I can't understand what you call people choose few call many choose a few I don't understand these things but that just shows my creativity my smallness then praise be to the your name by your greatness your mind is unfathomable is insurmountable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>

This article summarizes a debate between Pastor Marcos Granconato and Pastor César Cavalcante on the theological doctrines of Arminianism and Calvinism, focusing on their differing views on salvation. The discussion emphasizes that these two perspectives, while distinct, are generally considered orthodox within Christianity [01:16:19].

## Introduction to the Debate
The program features a debate on [[spiritual_topics_debates | spiritual topics and debates]] that has been highly requested [01:01:00]. The main topic for discussion is the [[concepts_of_calvinism_arminianism | doctrines of Calvinism and Arminianism]], which are defined as "doctrines of salvation" or "lines of salvation" [01:10:20].

## Debaters' Credentials
*   **Marcos Granconato**: A pastor of the Baptist Church Redemption in Tucuruvi, São Paulo, for 26 years, and a pastor since 1987. He holds a master's degree in ecclesiastical history from the Presbyterian and Andrew Jumper College [00:04:06]. Pastor Granconato was advised by Carosaldo Cardoso Pinto, whom he considers the greatest theologian to have set foot in Brazil [00:05:26].
*   **César Cavalcante**: Serves as a pastor in the Geru Christian Community of Campinas and is the director of the Bethesda Theological College (FTB) [00:06:51]. He graduated in Christian apologetics from the Christian Research Institute (ICP) before studying theology and Biblical Hebrew, which is his area of specialization [00:07:21]. He has been a Hebrew teacher for several years and coordinates courses, including an international theology course that ends in Israel [00:07:35]. He also directs a daily debate program on Rádio Musical FM and hosts "Growing in Faith," a program answering biblical questions live [00:07:53].

## Historical Context of [[concepts_of_calvinism_arminianism | Arminianism and Calvinism]]
Arminianism emerged within Calvinism and is not entirely different from it [01:10:36]. Jacob Arminius, who died in 1609, was a Calvinist and director of the University of Leiden in Holland [01:10:44]. Arminius began to have difficulties with the "more rigorous aspect" of the doctrine of predestination and election, which became extremely emphasized in 17th-century Calvinism, a period referred to as "Protestant scholasticism" [01:11:00]. This emphasis was influenced by the intellectual environment of the time, particularly the University of Padua, which dictated intellectual rules [01:11:50]. Calvinism, attempting to adjust, found its theological axis in predestination [01:12:05].

Arminius reacted, arguing that this emphasis did not do justice to God's character [01:12:18]. After Arminius's death in 1609 (or more accurately, his followers' presentation in 1610), his followers presented a document outlining their disagreements [01:12:30]. This led to the Synod of Dort (1618-1619) in the Netherlands, which established the five points of Calvinism [01:12:41]. Those who thought differently could not exercise pastoral ministry, leading to the banning of Arminians from their ministries [01:13:05]. Arminianism later developed further outside the Netherlands as many adherents had to leave [01:13:22].

Pastor Granconato notes that Calvin died in 1564, and Arminius was born in 1560, making them contemporaries in terms of century, but Arminius was only 4 years old when Calvin died [01:45:18]. The intellectual environment changed significantly after Calvin's death, and Arminius belonged to this "Protestant scholasticism" era where biblical exegesis was not as emphasized as in the time of biblical humanists like Luther and Calvin [01:45:46]. Calvin is considered a "waterfall" in exegetical production, with an unsurpassed method focused on the author's voice through grammatical, contextual, and historical elements [01:46:20].

## The Five Points (TULIP) and Doctrinal Differences
The Synod of Dort defined five points of Calvinist soteriology, known by the acronym TULIP [01:12:51]:
1.  **T**otal Depravity [01:14:45]
2.  **U**nconditional Election [01:14:49]
3.  **L**imited Atonement [01:14:50]
4.  **I**rresistible Grace [01:14:53]
5.  **P**erseverance of the Saints [01:14:56]

These points were not developed by Arminius or Calvin themselves, but rather by their followers later [02:00:00].

### Limited vs. Unlimited Atonement
A major point of contention is whether Jesus Christ died for all humanity or only for the elect.
*   **Calvinist View (Limited Atonement)**: Pastor Granconato explains that classic "five-point Calvinists" believe Jesus died to "buy his chosen ones" [03:04:49]. This view holds that Christ's death is effective only for the elect [02:06:04]. If God chose some before the foundation of the world, then Christ's death was logically for those chosen [02:09:19].
    *   Some Calvinists (e.g., the brine school in France, or "four-point Calvinists") hold a "hypothetical universalism," believing Christ died for the whole world so that *if* someone believes, they *can* believe [03:00:20]. However, Dort Calvinism states Christ died to "buy his chosen ones" [03:00:48].
*   **Arminian View (Unlimited Atonement)**: Pastor Cavalcante believes Jesus died for "every man" [02:42:58]. He cites Romans 11:32, stating God "ended all in disobedience in order to use mercy towards everyone" [03:34:03]. He argues the Bible states this "time after time" [03:27:07]. He also cites Hebrews 2:9, saying Jesus "tasted death for every man" [04:22:11].
    *   Cavalcante argues that if Jesus died only for a specific group, the gospel call to "preach the gospel to every creature" would not be "sincere" [03:46:17].
    *   Pastor Granconato interprets "all" in texts like Romans 11:32 to mean "Jews and Gentiles" [03:40:07], and not every single human being [03:46:44]. He also notes the malleability of "all" in the New Testament, citing John 12:32, where Jesus says he will "draw all men to myself," which cannot mean literally everyone on earth [03:48:51].

### God's Love and Wrath
*   **Arminian View**: Pastor Cavalcante states that [[spiritual_topics_debates | God loves everyone]] [05:13:07]. He argues that a God who does not love everyone is not the "true God," as God's essence is love (1 John 4:8) [05:28:10]. He states that God's proposal for salvation is "honest to all men" [06:41:40].
*   **Calvinist View**: Pastor Granconato explains that Calvinism maintains an "insoluble theological tension" [05:41:36]. God is infinite love, but also infinite wrath and justice [05:51:55]. He cites Proverbs 16:4: "the wicked for the day of calamity" [05:15:39], and Romans 9, which speaks of God making "vessels of wrath prepared for perdition" [05:57:01]. These concepts are harmonized in God's "unfathomable" and "inscrutable" mind, even if humans cannot fully understand how [05:57:01]. He criticizes the Arminian approach as "dishonest" or "inappropriate" for reinterpreting texts that speak of God's wrath to fit a loving God concept [05:58:01].

### Free Will and Human Responsibility
*   **Calvinist View**: Pastor Granconato believes that man has "will" but not "free will" in the theological sense of being free from corruption [02:16:05]. He explains that after Adam's fall, human will was corrupted, leading to an inclination towards evil and disgust for holy things [02:16:55]. Man cannot come to God unless the Father enables him (John 6:44) [02:17:48]. While God opens hearts (Acts 16:14), humans do decide to believe in Christ [02:08:52]. The "Irresistible Grace" means God works over time to convince the elect of sin, righteousness, and judgment [02:09:31]. The paradox is that God decrees all things, yet man is still responsible for his actions [02:17:15]. This is an "insoluble and untouchable" tension in theology [02:17:02].
    *   He defines human freedom as operating "within a sphere called God's decree" [02:26:50]. This doesn't mean absence of limits, but rather operating within God's determined plan [02:27:00].
*   **Arminian View**: Pastor Cavalcante agrees that salvation comes *only* from God (monergism) [02:11:01]. However, he believes God also calls humans to participate "synergistically" [02:11:41]. He cites 2 Corinthians 6:1, where Paul says, "we cooperating also with God... we exhort you not to receive the grace of God in vain" [02:12:10]. He believes man "can receive, can accept, can extend the hand and receive this grace" [02:13:21].
    *   He argues that if God decreed everything, then the final judgment makes no sense, as individuals would not be truly responsible for their actions [02:15:06]. He cites Genesis 4, where God tells Cain he can do well and be accepted, implying a choice [02:14:24]. He also questions the idea that Judas was predetermined to betray Jesus, asking how he could be held accountable [02:23:03].

### Foreknowledge vs. Preordination
*   **Calvinist View**: Pastor Granconato argues that God's "foreknowledge" (prognosis) in Peter 1:20 and Romans 8:29 means "chose" or "pre-ordained" [02:56:16]. He cites Genesis 18:19 and Amos 3:2 where the Hebrew word "know" is translated as "chose" in Portuguese [02:06:50]. He contends that God knows the future because He "wrote" or "planned" it beforehand [02:41:24]. This encompasses every detail, including the fall of Adam [02:22:40].
*   **Arminian View**: Pastor Cavalcante insists that "foreknowledge" means God "knew beforehand" because of His omniscience, not because He determined it [02:35:56]. He believes God "discovered" the future, rather than "invented" or "wrote" it [02:25:02]. God's omniscience means He knows all past, present, and future [02:33:57]. He questions how Judas could be judged if his actions were predetermined [02:37:05].

## Christian Unity
Both pastors emphasize that these doctrinal differences, while important, do not make believers "enemies" [01:44:47]. Pastor Cavalcante states that [[christian_unity_and_division | Christianity]] unites believers as "brothers in faith," regardless of their position on TULIP [01:44:50]. He stresses that the core belief in Christ as Redeemer and Savior is what truly matters [01:59:09]. He also notes that both aspects (Arminianism and Calvinism) are considered "orthodox" and not "heretical" within [[church_history_theological_discussions | church history and theological discussions]] [01:16:22].

## Conclusion
The debate highlights the complexities of theological discussions and the differing interpretations of biblical texts within [[historical_context_development_protestant_theology | Protestant theology]]. Both speakers acknowledge the paradoxical nature of some divine attributes and human free will, ultimately deferring to God's incomprehensible mind on certain points [03:11:07]. The discussion ends with a reminder that one's personal belief in Christ is the ultimate assurance of salvation [01:52:22].

The discussion of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), has gained significant attention, particularly with recent governmental efforts to take sightings more seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:50">[03:46:50]</a>.

## Evolution of Terminology
Initially referred to as UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects), the terminology has officially evolved to UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>. This changed again to "Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon" to include objects appearing in the sea, acknowledging that not all phenomena are strictly aerial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>. The acronym UAP was retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:29">[03:28:29]</a>.

## Government Involvement
In recent years, governments, especially the American government, have begun to address [[ufo_sightings_and_abductions | UFO sightings and abductions]] with more seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:50">[03:46:50]</a>.

### United States
The US government established a committee within Congress to handle UAP reports, leading to annual official reports since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:02">[03:56:02]</a>. This surge in interest, occurring slightly before the pandemic around 2019, was partly influenced by former President Trump's statements about opening relevant documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:20">[03:19:20]</a>. Key [[reports_and_credibility_of_ufo_sightings | reports and credibility of UFO sightings]] included sightings filmed by US Navy ships, such as the famous "Tic-Tac" video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This raised public awareness that unknown objects were flying over military assets, prompting investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>.

NASA also formed an independent commission of scientists to analyze UAP data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Their initial findings indicated a need for appropriate equipment, correct detection methods, and analysis of unified data, with a focus on removing the stigma associated with reporting sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. NASA suggested that many phenomena could be atmospheric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:42">[03:47:42]</a>.

The US government also launched a website for citizens to report any unusual aerial phenomena they observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:39">[03:57:39]</a>. This initiative aims to collect widespread data, potentially aiding in surveillance and identifying unknown foreign objects like Chinese balloons or drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:11">[03:58:11]</a>.

### Mexico
The Mexican government recently held a public hearing on UAPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. However, this hearing faced criticism for featuring a well-known ufologist with a history of fabricating evidence, including manipulated videos, photos, and assembled bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. The "little animals" presented, claimed to be from Nasca, Peru, were found to be manipulated, with scientific analysis showing assembled bones and mixed DNA from various sources like humans, beans, and oxen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This charade was widely condemned by figures like former US Air Force pilot Ryan Graves, who strives to bring scientific rigor to the study of these phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

### Other Countries
[[brazilian_ufo_and_mystery_cases | Brazilian UFO and mystery cases]] and those in Central and Latin America are notably numerous, with many reports in Peru, Chile, and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The movement towards official investigation is not isolated, with Canada also showing interest following incidents like a Chinese balloon passing over its airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## Natural Phenomena Often Mistaken for UAPs
Many [[ufo_sightings_and_abductions | UFO sightings and abductions]] can be explained by natural atmospheric phenomena.

### Sprites
Sprites are atmospheric electrical discharges that occur at high altitudes, resembling lightning flashes but not touching the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. They can blink in various locations, leading observers to mistake them for multiple, fast-moving ships or objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. While often associated with storms, they can be seen up to 2000 km away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Sprites primarily appear reddish but can also be bluish or yellowish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Historically, before the advent of advanced cameras, such phenomena likely led to [[historical_ufo_cases | historical UFO cases]] and misinterpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Ball Lightning
Ball lightning is a natural electrical phenomenon appearing as a luminous sphere, often observed in areas with certain agricultural conditions like sugarcane or soybean plantations, especially during dry spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. These "balls running" are sometimes associated with folklore like Boitat√° <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Scientific Approach to UAP Identification
When assessing UAPs, the scientific method involves an "exclusion" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Before concluding that a phenomenon is related to [[extraterrestrial_life_and_ufo_sightings | extraterrestrial life and UFO sightings]], it is essential to rule out all known natural or human-made explanations, such as lightning, sprites, balloons, or military drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. This rigorous process emphasizes that [[the_role_of_technology_and_government_in_the_ufo_phenomenon | the role of technology and government in the UFO phenomenon]] is to implement scientific methodology for investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

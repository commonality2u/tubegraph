Igor Guimarães, known as Guinho, is a talented imitator and comedian whose career has seen him evolve from struggling stand-up to a prominent figure in Brazilian comedy, particularly recognized for his unique characters and work on the *Pânico* program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Early Career and Comedy Style

Guimarães's trajectory began with initial attempts at classic stand-up comedy, which he admits did not go well. He describes these early shows as "horrible," noting that he struggled to elicit laughter from the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. This led him to decide he would "never do it again" in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

He eventually found his stride by adopting a style where he could "say what I want to say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. This evolved into a "schizophrenic" and loud approach, which he embraced as his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. He also prefers performing with multiple comedians in a show, believing it offers a better audience experience compared to solo acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:40">[02:55:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:46">[02:55:46]</a>.

### Solo Show and Characters
Guimarães developed a solo show titled "10-year solo" that incorporated a mix of his various characters and performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:16">[02:15:16]</a>. This show allowed him to present all his known talents, including singing and dancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:35">[02:19:35]</a>.

He is well-known for his impersonations, particularly his impression of Alok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. His characters include:
*   **Josias the puppet:** A character that originated on *Pânico*, known for its "heavy" humor and absurdity, which he believes captivated a younger audience that was leaning towards lighter comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. This character was created at the suggestion of [[marcos_chiesas_career_and_journey_in_entertainment | Morgado]] and writer Beth Moreno <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.
*   **Lawyer Paloma** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>
*   **Indian Ana Jones:** A character inspired by Danny Trejo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

Guimarães used costume changes and pre-recorded videos during his solo show to divide time and allow for character transitions, including quick makeup changes and prop removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:35">[02:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>.

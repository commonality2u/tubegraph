## Early Life and Entry into Acting

He started acting when he was around 10 or 11 years old, initially appearing in commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. This led to auditions for TV series and subsequent appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. His parents were very supportive of his acting aspirations from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:51">[03:33:51]</a>. Despite working as a child actor, he maintained a relatively normal childhood by attending public school in Florida whenever he wasn't filming *Everybody Hates Chris* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.

## *Everybody Hates Chris* (2005-2009)

### Dealing with Rejection

The entertainment industry is rife with rejection, a reality Martella learned to navigate from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. He described the audition process for *Everybody Hates Chris* as lasting almost two months with multiple auditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:20">[02:41:20]</a>. He has experienced filming pilots that were never picked up and even being replaced in a cast after a re-audition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>. He advises aspiring actors to only pursue acting if they truly love it, as financial success is difficult to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>.

### Relationship with Cast and Crew

Martella maintained close relationships with his co-stars and the production team. He considered the opportunity to work alongside experienced actors like Terry Crews and Tichina Arnold as invaluable, learning from their long careers in sitcoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:15">[05:54:15]</a>. He also frequently interacted with the show's writers, especially in later seasons, to understand the episodes' progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:15">[05:59:15]</a>. Chris Rock, the show's creator and narrator, notably advised Martella not to "smoke crack" when he was 13, a humorous and memorable piece of advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. Martella sees his fellow cast members like high school friends, and he continues to support their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

### Show's Success in Brazil

*Everybody Hates Chris* gained immense popularity in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Martella attributes this to several factors:

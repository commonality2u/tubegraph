Canine units, often referred to as K9s, play a crucial role in the detection of contraband, particularly in environments like airports and ports. Their effectiveness stems from their keen sense of smell and specialized training, complementing other [[criminal_investigations_and_procedures | investigative techniques]] and risk management strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>.

## Role and Capabilities

Dogs primarily operate by identifying the odor of specific substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:38">[03:12:38]</a>. They are not trained to be addicted to drugs but rather to associate the scent of contraband with a reward, typically a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:38">[03:12:38]</a>. This training allows them to detect various illicit items, including:
*   Drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:44">[03:12:44]</a>
*   Explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:45">[03:12:45]</a>
*   Money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>

Their sense of smell is highly sensitive to any changes or specific odors associated with illegal merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:53">[03:12:53]</a>. When a dog detects a target odor, its trained behavior is to sit and stare at the source of the smell, indicating a find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:16">[03:13:16]</a>. This is then followed by their handler rewarding them with a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:36">[03:13:36]</a>.

## Training and Breeds

Canine detection dogs undergo rigorous training from a young age, often since they are puppies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:45">[03:13:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:47">[03:13:47]</a>. Training centers, such as one in Vit√≥ria, Brazil, are recognized for their expertise in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:19">[03:12:19]</a>.

Common breeds used for detection work include:
*   Belgian Shepherd Malinois <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:13">[03:14:13]</a>
*   Border Collies (currently being trained) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:58">[03:13:58]</a>

The selection process for these dogs is stringent, ensuring they possess a suitable temperament that is neither too passive nor overly aggressive, and they must enjoy playing without being aggressive towards humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:47">[03:16:47]</a>. Different dogs may be suited for different types of work; for instance, a dog for detecting drugs on a passenger's body or in carry-on luggage needs to be calm and non-intrusive, not drooling or scraping at people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:20">[03:14:20]</a>.

## Complementary Role and Effectiveness

Canine units work in tandem with human intelligence and [[technological_advancements_in_forensic_science | technological advancements]] in detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>. While human officers conduct [[criminal_investigations_and_procedures | risk management]] analysis based on passenger data, dogs provide a "shave hair and mustache" approach, broadly inspecting all passengers on a flight, for example, to catch anything missed by initial analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:50">[02:11:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:24">[02:32:24]</a>. This is particularly useful for detecting unusual or unexpected cases, such as drugs being carried by an elderly person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:18">[02:38:18]</a>.

Dogs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in detecting [[drug_trafficking_and_challenges_in_policing | drugs]] hidden in very elaborate ways, such as inside a 1.5-ton granite stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:01">[03:15:01]</a>. Their ability to detect odors even through small gaps in containers or packages highlights their acute sense of smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:39">[03:15:39]</a>.

## Public Engagement

Canine units also participate in public outreach, visiting schools and universities to demonstrate their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:53">[03:15:53]</a>. These demonstrations often involve playful scenarios where children hide "bait" (substances with the target odor) in suitcases, and the dogs find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:12">[03:16:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:14">[03:16:14]</a>. This helps educate the public, especially young people, about the importance of [[law_enforcement_and_public_safety | law enforcement]] and potentially deter future involvement in activities like being a "mule" in [[drug_trafficking_in_airports | drug trafficking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:31">[03:16:31]</a>.

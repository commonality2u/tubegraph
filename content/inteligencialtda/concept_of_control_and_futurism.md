The world is reportedly moving towards a new era defined by a "dispute of control," shifting from historical territorial expansion to controlling the minds and hearts of people, as well as influencing DNA and other aspects of human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>. This emerging period is characterized as an "era of control" where human beings will be highly monitored and manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:46">[08:01:46]</a>.

## Perspectives on Control and Free Will

### Yuval Noah Harari's Vision
Historian Yuval Noah Harari, known for books like *Sapiens* and *Homo Deus*, proposes that future humans will be "improved" through the introduction of chips and electronic devices, enabling them to compete with [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:14">[03:27:14]</a>. Harari suggests that the 20th-century worldviews, such as communism and liberalism (or capitalism), are outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:33">[03:47:33]</a>. He asserts that human beings do not possess free will, never have, and will not in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:07">[05:19:07]</a>.

Harari's view is that humans are merely the result of electrochemical processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:02">[05:34:02]</a>. He illustrates this by stating that an individual who stabs a neighbor is not inherently evil, but rather experiencing disorders or pathologies in these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:06">[05:50:06]</a>. He questions the concept of free will, suggesting that if technology could prevent undesirable decisions, it should be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:14">[07:14:14]</a>.

### Technological Advancements and Control
The current landscape already demonstrates [[technological_control_and_its_impact_on_society | technological control]] through social networks and streaming platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:59">[08:09:59]</a>. These platforms control what content users see, creating "bubbles" that limit exposure to differing opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:43">[08:29:43]</a>. Data collection through online activity, including location and viewing habits, maps an individual's life, with [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications | artificial intelligence]] suggesting content based on this data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:21">[13:25:21]</a>.

The discussion highlights the gradual loss of free will as algorithms guide choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:23">[10:53:23]</a>. Medical advancements, particularly in treating mental pathologies like depression with electromagnetic sessions, demonstrate the potential for technology to interfere with internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:04">[16:33:04]</a>. However, the danger lies in who controls these devices, especially if they are implanted within individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:30">[12:51:30]</a>. Such devices could affect choices, decisions, and even read thoughts, leading to a highly monitored and manipulated future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:24">[23:51:24]</a>.

### Spiritual and Philosophical Perspectives
The concept of free will is contrasted with [[spiritual_perspectives_on_modern_technology_and_control | spiritual perspectives on modern technology and control]], where intrusive thoughts are sometimes attributed to external spiritual influences (demons) rather than solely internal chemical processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. The Bible, for instance, is cited as asserting that "our fight is not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers of the celestial regions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:20">[32:43:20]</a>.

Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's idea of "God is Dead" is discussed, where the decline of belief in an absolute moral God leads to a society without inherent moral or ethical restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:10">[35:04:10]</a>. This concept gave rise to the "Ãœbermensch" (Superman), an individual unbound by traditional morality, empowering them to pursue desires without fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:53">[36:20:53]</a>. This perspective, particularly influential on figures like Hitler, demonstrates the danger of a world without a higher moral authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:22">[36:59:22]</a>.

## The Fourth Revolution and Eugenics
The current era is described as the "Fourth Revolution," following the agricultural, industrial, and technological (computer) revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:59:58">[41:59:58]</a>. This revolution is characterized by [[advancements_in_technology_and_potential_impacts | biotechnology]] and [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications | artificial intelligence]], which will directly interfere with people's lives and even biodiversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:34">[42:58:34]</a>. The idea of implanting chips that analyze DNA is presented, touching upon epigenetics, which suggests that thoughts and feelings can influence genes and be passed down through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:18:28">[43:18:28]</a>.

This [[advancements_in_technology_and_potential_impacts | advancement]] raises concerns about eugenics, the historical attempt to create a "superior race" by controlling genetic traits. Movies like "Gattaca" are cited as examples of this dystopian future where individuals are judged and limited based on their genetic perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. The speaker expresses worry that without proper regulation, this path could lead to a society where only the wealthy have access to genetic "improvements," creating an "inferior race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.

## Biblical Prophecy and the Spirit of Antichrist
The increasing [[influence_of_technology_on_human_behavior_and_free_will | influence of technology]] and control aligns with biblical prophecies regarding the future government of the Antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The speaker explicitly links the "mark of the beast" to a system of control, potentially involving voluntary chips that later become mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09">[01:36:09]</a>. This system, influenced by the World Economic Forum, seeks to leverage global events to implement necessary changes for humanity's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>.

The "Spirit of Antichrist" is seen as driving a global cultural war, aiming to increasingly portray Christian faith as politically incorrect and encourage rejection of Jesus' teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. This aligns with [[current_global_tensions_and_the_end_of_times_perspective | end-of-times perspective]] where there will be both armed conflicts and a spiritual war that challenges traditional faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.

### Apostasy and Religious Extremism
Apostasy, defined as a "divorce from the truth" or a "break with Jesus," is discussed as a significant sign of the end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:21">[02:26:21]</a>. This includes churches that reinterpret or dismiss biblical teachings, leading to a relativization of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>.

Religious extremism, exemplified by countries like North Korea, Iran, and Syria, is presented as another form of control, where certain religions prohibit others, and Christians may face persecution or loss of social status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>. Communist regimes, following Marx's view of religion as "the opium of the people," actively suppress faith to prevent resistance against secular authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.

## Resistance and Hope
Despite these concerns, the speaker emphasizes that the church's role is to resist the Spirit of Antichrist not through force, but through love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55">[01:56:55]</a>. The message of Christ, characterized by peace and love, is seen as the true path to unify a divided world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

The speaker highlights personal experiences of spiritual warfare and divine protection, reinforcing the belief in a spiritual world where angels fight against demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. Faith is presented as a means to overcome spiritual struggles and anxiety, emphasizing trust in God's plan and intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. The ultimate hope lies in Christ's ability to transform lives and bring salvation, regardless of past sins or current struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:50">[02:53:50]</a>.

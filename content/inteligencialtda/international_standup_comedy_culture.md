The world of [[Standup comedy experiences and challenges | standup comedy]] varies significantly across different cultures, influencing everything from comedic style to audience reception and even acceptable topics. Comedians traveling between countries often face unique [[Challenges and experiences in standup comedy | challenges]] and opportunities, adapting their craft to local sensibilities.

## Cultural Differences in Humor

Humor styles and audience expectations can differ greatly from one country to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

### Brazilian Humor
Brazilian humor is often characterized by self-ridicule and finding laughter in misfortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. It can be seen as "fifth-grade humor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>, and there's a strong culture of memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. Brazilians are described as very playful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:37">[02:20:37]</a>.

### French Humor
French humor tends to be drier and more observational, similar to English humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. It can sometimes be difficult for Brazilians to discern if a French person is joking or being arrogant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. There's a cultural tendency to turn pain into laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:22">[02:38:22]</a>.

### German Humor
German humor is generally perceived as drier, making it challenging to understand if a statement is a joke or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Germans tend to be more accepting of jokes made about their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:22">[02:52:22]</a>.

## Standup in Different Countries

Performing [[Foreign comedians experience in Brazil | standup comedy]] across borders requires understanding local audiences and cultural norms.

### Performing for Brazilian Communities Abroad
Comedians have successfully performed for Brazilian communities living abroad, with shows selling out in places like Bellini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a> and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, even receiving standing ovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

### Challenges in France
Shows in Portuguese are generally not desired in France, as audiences prefer jokes in French, English, or German that make sense within their cultural context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:51">[01:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Humor based on Brazilian references often doesn't translate well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

However, performing in French, especially on topics related to the experience of being a foreigner or a French person who has lived abroad, can find an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:49">[03:02:49]</a>. The popularity of a comedian in another country can also increase their value and recognition in their home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:22">[03:39:22]</a>.

### Humor as a Relief Mechanism
Humor is used as a form of comic relief in movies, theater, cartoons, and comics in various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:49">[02:37:49]</a>.

## [[Cancel culture and its impact on comedy | Limits of Humor and Cancel Culture]]

The boundaries of humor, especially concerning sensitive topics, vary significantly.

### Censorship and Offense
While in theory, one can joke about anything if the joke is good, in practice, this is often not the case, and comedians may face lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:16">[02:37:16]</a>. In Brazil, humor can be seen as reinforcing prejudice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:30">[02:38:30]</a>.

Certain topics are generally avoided by comedians to prevent offending audiences or losing followers:
*   **Politics:** It's often advised to avoid political jokes, as it can lead to audience division and loss of followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>. In Brazil, merely wearing specific colors (e.g., a national team shirt) can be interpreted as a political stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
*   **Football (Soccer):** This is another sensitive area in Brazil that comedians avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.
*   **Amazon Rainforest:** Jokes about the Amazon are sensitive due to political conflicts between French and Brazilian presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.
*   **Religion:** While some Christian comedians might joke about Jesus, it's generally advised to avoid religious topics due to their importance to Brazilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
*   **National Identity:** Jokes that mock a country's people or culture directly can be poorly received, especially from foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

### The Context of Jokes
The acceptability of a joke depends heavily on the context where it's delivered, such as on the street versus in a theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:37">[02:41:37]</a>. Jokes told within a close circle of friends might be considered offensive if said publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:31">[02:42:31]</a>.

### "Cancel Culture" in Brazil
There's a perception that some people in Brazil actively "search to cancel someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:08">[02:44:08]</a>. This phenomenon is often linked to the attention economy and can be driven by a desire for fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:19">[02:44:19]</a>. However, some argue that excessive criminalization of jokes devalues real problems like racism and creates more taboos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:45">[02:42:45]</a>.

## The Business of International Comedy

For comedians, navigating the international landscape also involves understanding the business side, from tours to social media engagement.

### Touring and Specials
Comedians undertake international tours to record specials in multiple countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. These tours can be expensive, requiring significant investment in production and travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Social Media Presence
Brazil is noted as one of the top countries for social media usage, making it a good environment for influencers to grow an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:34">[03:33:34]</a>. In France, there's less of a culture of "idolizing" influencers, and people are more private, preferring not to expose their personal lives on platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:59">[03:39:59]</a>.

[!NOTE|Personal Experiences]
One comedian recalled losing 2,000 followers in 30 minutes after posting a political pun that was misinterpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. Another had a viral video about a French swear word that gained 9 million views on TikTok before being taken down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:0:19">[04:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.

### Breaking into Standup
For aspiring comedians, a recommended path includes performing 50 to 100 open mics to learn and develop material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:07">[03:06:07]</a>, gradually building up to longer sets and eventually a solo show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:16">[03:06:16]</a>. Becoming a good comedian can take one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:26">[03:06:26]</a>.

## Foreign Comedians in Brazil

The [[Foreign comedians experience in Brazil | experience of foreign comedians in Brazil]] often involves cultural immersion and adapting to local customs.

### Learning Portuguese
Foreigners often learn Portuguese by immersing themselves in the language and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. The Brazilian emphasis on politeness means that direct answers can be difficult to receive, and there's a tendency to use indirect language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

### Adapting to Social Norms
Social customs in Brazil, such as dating and physical displays of affection, can be more liberal than in some European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>. Group payments at restaurants, where everyone splits the bill evenly regardless of individual consumption, can also be a point of cultural difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.

### Perceptions and Challenges
Foreigners in Brazil may sometimes be perceived as wealthy and targeted by scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>. They might also be tricked into using inappropriate slang or asked to perform unusual tasks for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>.

Despite these challenges, many foreign comedians express gratitude for the Brazilian audience and the warmth of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:45">[03:11:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:07">[03:39:07]</a>. The Brazilian cultural openness and welcoming nature are often cited as reasons for living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:57">[02:19:57]</a>.

## Media Appearances and Credibility

Appearances on television shows like [[Danilo Gentilis standup comedy career and challenges | Danilo Gentili's program]] can provide significant credibility for comedians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:35">[03:09:35]</a>. While a viral video might offer comparable visibility, a TV appearance acts as a "stamp" of legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:42">[03:09:42]</a>. However, TV interviews can be stressful due to audience size, multiple cameras, and the inability to edit mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:05">[03:10:05]</a>.

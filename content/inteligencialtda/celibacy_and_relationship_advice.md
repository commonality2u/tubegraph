Sara Shiva, a pastor and emotional intelligence mentor, offers insights into [[faith_and_spirituality_discussions | Christian faith]], celibacy, and [[relationship_dynamics_and_the_concept_of_love | relationship dynamics]], drawing from her personal experiences and biblical interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>.

## Celibacy: A Path to Holiness

Sara Shiva openly shares her personal commitment to celibacy, stating she has not kissed anyone or been sexually active for over 22 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:36">[01:54:36]</a>. This choice stems from her belief that sex is exclusive to marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:48">[01:54:48]</a>.

### Challenging Societal Norms
She highlights how society often equates abstinence with humiliation or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>, particularly for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:24">[01:45:24]</a>. However, Shiva asserts that true happiness and fulfillment do not depend on having a romantic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>. She emphasizes that one must first be "full and happy" oneself to attract a similar partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>.

### The Example of Christ
Shiva notes that Christ himself "died a virgin at 33 years old," and believers are not forced to die virgins but are asked to wait for marriage to experience the fullness of sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:17">[01:55:17]</a>. This perspective encourages a radical approach to holiness, which can be challenging but ultimately leads to a deeper relationship with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

## Relationship Advice: Building a Godly Partnership

Shiva provides comprehensive advice on [[dynamics_of_longterm_relationships | relationship dynamics]], emphasizing biblical principles and spiritual discernment.

### The Sacred Alliance of Marriage
Marriage is presented as a perpetual alliance, a reflection of God's fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:06">[03:56:06]</a>.
To be married "before God and before the law of Men," a couple needs to complete three steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>:
1.  **Legalization before human law**: This involves a civil ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>.
2.  **Priestly Blessing**: A priest or pastor, who believes in God's word, administers a blessing over the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.
3.  **Consummation**: The marriage is consummated through carnal conjunction (sexual intercourse) in the "bridal tent" or honeymoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:56">[01:41:56]</a>.

Shiva criticizes couples who skip these steps, especially those who only engage in sexual activity without legal or spiritual blessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>. For couples who began their relationship in sin, she advises a period of repentance and sexual consecration, such as abstaining for at least 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>.

### Choosing a Partner
A key piece of advice is to marry your "best friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:24">[01:56:24]</a>.
*   **Men** are primarily drawn by a woman's physical beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a>.
*   **Women**, however, are primarily attracted by admiration and feeling protected, not just looks or sexual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:29">[01:57:29]</a>.

It is crucial for a partner to be a person of strong character, as admiration is vital for a woman to stay committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:26">[01:57:26]</a>.

### Dating Practices
Dating should be a period of discernment, not physical intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>.
*   **No Kissing**: For those with a promiscuous past, kissing during dating should be avoided as it instantly triggers desires that are not appropriate before marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>. Dating is a time to "meet, to fight, to argue, to see the bad side, of arguing, of stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:12">[01:53:12]</a>.
*   **The "Hand Test"**: On a first date, a person should politely remove their hand if the other person places theirs on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:55">[02:08:55]</a>. The reaction to this boundary can reveal an abusive or disrespectful character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:21">[02:09:21]</a>.
*   **Honesty**: It is important to be honest about one's intentions, even if it's "just to have fun," to avoid misleading others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:48">[02:03:48]</a>.

### Holiness in Married Life
For married couples, kissing is the "flame of marriage" and essential for a healthy sexual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>. Shiva advises against a "mediocre sexual life" in Christian marriages, encouraging couples to maintain passion and intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>. Sexual relations within marriage, when consecrated, represent the "communion of the Holy Spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:25">[02:58:25]</a>.

## Desires and Temptation: The Spiritual Battle

Shiva explains that all suffering stems from unsatisfied desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:50">[04:09:50]</a>. Desire is "never satisfied" and always seeks more, whether it's money or sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:56">[04:09:56]</a>.

### Five Entry Doors
Temptation enters through five "entry doors" of the physical senses: vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. These senses can awaken desires that lead to sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a>.

### Arts and Sexuality as Pillars of Worship
Shiva identifies arts (especially music) and sexuality as the "two pillars of invocation on earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Music**: All music is either inspired by heaven or hell; there is no neutral music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:47">[02:49:47]</a>. The devil, originally the chief of heaven's music, still possesses the power to create music that can corrupt and weaken nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Sexuality**: God uses the language of sex to describe spiritual infidelity, comparing idol worship to prostitution and adultery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>.

Both areas are battlegrounds where the devil works to "desecrate" and corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:53">[03:04:53]</a>. God is tolerant of all sins except "worship" and "evocation" of other gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:24">[03:05:24]</a>. Sins related to sexual pleasure and arts are often harder to repent from because they involve deep-seated gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:51">[03:05:51]</a>.

### Holiness as Protection
Holiness in one's private life is the ultimate protection against spiritual attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:47">[02:26:47]</a>. The devil fears the holiness of believers who refuse to compromise with sin, even hidden ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>. This authority comes from individual obedience to God's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>.

## Personal Journey and Ministry

Sara Shiva grew up as the daughter of famous Brazilian musicians, Baby do Brasil and Pepeu Gomes, inheriting a background of [[personal_anecdotes_and_relationship_stories | musical and alternative movements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. She was raised with significant freedom and no repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>, leading to a promiscuous lifestyle in her youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:48">[01:53:48]</a>.

### Conversion and Calling
Her conversion experience in October 1997 involved a supernatural encounter where she witnessed a demon possessing someone, which shattered her humanist and esoteric beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. This led her to seek God through prayer and a profound, intimate experience where God revealed himself as real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.

After her conversion, Shiva joined her sisters in a secular music band, SNZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. However, her desire shifted to singing praise music that "frees, transforms, and changes the soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. A powerful vision, triggered by reading a CD insert, revealed to her the spiritual battle over music and arts, confirming that all shows are "cults in disguise" that worship either God or the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>. This vision led to her band being dismissed, which she saw as a liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:48">[01:32:48]</a>.

### Ministry and Challenges
Shiva's ministry now focuses on sound theology, desires, and relationships, particularly counseling for singles and families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. She runs programs like the "princess cult movement" for women, teaching [[psychological_and_spiritual_maturation_in_relationships | emotional intelligence]] and strict boundaries in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>. She also developed courses for men on understanding female sexuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Her outspoken nature and unconventional approach to addressing sensitive topics like sexuality and spiritual warfare have often led to controversy and attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>. Despite constant spiritual battles and fake news campaigns, Shiva remains committed to her mission, believing that God uses her to bring people to holiness and freedom from sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:56">[02:25:56]</a>.

### [[life_challenges_and_wisdom | Life Challenges]] and Spiritual Growth
Shiva considers her most difficult life challenge to be the "empty nest syndrome" when her daughter moved out, coupled with her diagnosis of attention deficit disorder (ADHD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:49">[03:06:49]</a>. This period of isolation and self-discovery, though painful, led to significant [[psychological_and_spiritual_maturation_in_relationships | personal growth]] and forgiveness for past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:17">[03:09:17]</a>.

She expresses a deep faith in Jesus Christ's imminent return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:38">[03:10:38]</a>, and her ultimate desire is for her life to glorify His name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:52">[03:58:52]</a>.

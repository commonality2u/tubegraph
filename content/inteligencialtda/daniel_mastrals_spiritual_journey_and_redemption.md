Daniel Mastral, author and speaker, shared his personal [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | spiritual journey]] from deep involvement in Satanism to his conversion to Christianity, highlighting the challenges and insights gained from this transformative experience.

## Background in Satanism

Mastral revealed that his initial "strolling through this satellite thing" of Satanism went "very deep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. He was not merely an interviewer; he was a participant who "already went backwoodsman use of the game itself on the satanic doctrine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. He became part of a "Brotherhood of High Magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. His involvement began at age 17 and lasted for "almost nine years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>, reaching the level of a wizard and eventually a high priest within the Brotherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:44">[02:38:44]</a>.

The doctrines of the Brotherhood taught him to believe that the devil was good and God was evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:32">[02:43:32]</a>. Their rituals often involved blood and death, as blood is considered vital energy that entities feed on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>. His initiation ritual included a mark on his body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:21">[03:01:21]</a>, a symbol similar to an inverted Euro sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:32">[03:02:32]</a>. He was chosen for the Brotherhood based on Kabbalistic, numerological, and astrological traits, and his bloodline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:13">[03:04:13]</a>. His direct supervisor at his workplace was also a Satanist, which facilitated his entry into the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:39">[03:02:39]</a>.

## Conversion Experience

Daniel Mastral's conversion was a profound moment that led to his [[role_of_faith_in_overcoming_spiritual_struggles | redemption]]. He recounts an instance where he attempted to use a spell to kill a pastor, a ritual that involved all-night ceremonies and precise details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:17">[01:56:17]</a>. He even gathered five other wizards to assist, performing rituals like the pentagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. However, the spell failed, and the pastor, Luiz Augusto, remained unharmed after a car accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>.

This failure piqued Mastral's curiosity, leading him to meet Pastor Luiz Augusto. During their encounter in the pastor's room, Mastral felt an overwhelming sense of fear, a feeling he had never experienced before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:47">[01:57:47]</a>. The pastor prayed for him, and Mastral described feeling an immediate, profound peace, a sensation he had "never felt in my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:37">[01:59:37]</a>. In that moment, he "felt the peace that transfer understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:41">[01:59:41]</a> and decided to accept Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:34">[01:59:34]</a>.

## Post-Conversion Challenges

Immediately after his [[personal_conversion and faith journey | conversion]], Mastral faced significant challenges and threats from the Satanic Brotherhood, who had taught him there was "no turning back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:08">[02:00:08]</a>. They set a specific "day and time to kill" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:14">[02:21:14]</a>, making threatening calls to his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:31">[02:21:31]</a>.

He recounts an incident where a girl from the Brotherhood contacted him, wanting to leave but fearing for her life. After their conversation, she disappeared, intensifying his fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. On the designated night for his execution, when his friends from church refused to stay with him, he and his wife prayed for God's protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>. He experienced a profound sense of "tranquility" and "serenity" upon returning home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>, and his wife also felt the presence of angels guarding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:17">[02:25:17]</a>. God allowed him to see "humanoid forms" emanating light, which he understood to be angels protecting his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:52">[02:25:52]</a>.

Later, he learned that the two individuals sent to kill him had died in a car accident, confirming to him the reality of God's protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:36">[02:27:36]</a>. This experience solidified his faith, and he "never doubted God again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:40">[02:28:40]</a>.

## The Story of Pastor Luiz Augusto

Pastor Luiz Augusto, the man who led Daniel to Christ, also experienced a challenging [[personal_conversion_and_faith_journey | journey]]. After helping Mastral, he was "sent away from the church" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:26">[02:12:26]</a> because the church didn't believe in [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | spiritual battle]] or [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | demonic possession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:58">[02:12:58]</a>. He then moved to work in another church, where he faced bullying and mistreatment from the congregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:42">[02:13:42]</a>. This led him to leave the ministry and start selling children's shoes in Vila Velha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:58">[02:13:58]</a>.

During this period, he succumbed to drug addiction (cocaine) and became involved in prostitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:08">[02:14:08]</a>. His wife, however, "never gave up on him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:28">[02:14:28]</a>. Daniel Mastral and his wife invited Pastor Luiz to stay at their home in Vale da Benção. Reluctantly, Luiz agreed to pray with them, openly stating that he had once prayed for Daniel and freed him, and now hoped Daniel's prayer would free him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:20">[02:15:20]</a>. Luiz cried "like a baby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:38">[02:15:38]</a> and was reconciled with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:43">[02:15:43]</a>. Although he wished to return to pastoring, the church that preached forgiveness "never gave it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:48">[02:15:48]</a>, so he began selling gingerbread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:51">[02:15:51]</a> and later worked in chaplaincy, sharing his testimony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>. Pastor Luiz Augusto died a "normal dead death," succumbing to a hospital infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:12">[02:16:12]</a>. Daniel carries a photo with him that, when examined, visibly shows a "very dark stain" behind Pastor Luiz, which Daniel interprets as an entity that had been on his "tail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:42">[02:16:42]</a>, suggesting the spiritual battle he fought throughout his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:12">[02:17:12]</a>.

## Insights on Faith and Spiritual Protection

Mastral emphasizes the importance of a strong spiritual life for protection against evil. He asserts that if one lives "a life straight before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a> and in God's will, there is no need to fear curses or spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. He quotes Proverbs 26:2, stating that "curse without cause he finds no landing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. He uses the analogy of armor: if there are no "gaps" (sins like pride, arrogance, greed, envy, lying), the curse "hits and bounces back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. However, conscious and repetitive sins create these "holes" that allow negative spiritual influences to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

A tripod of prayer, worship, and knowledge of God's word builds faith, leading to more love and trust, making spells ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. He stresses the importance of forgiveness, seeing it as releasing oneself from "cancer from within" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Daniel also discusses how negative energy can be transmitted even through thoughts, citing experiments with plants that reacted negatively to harmful thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. Being in a positive state, having "joy in the Lord," acts as a strength against such influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

Regarding [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | exorcism]] and spiritual warfare, Mastral clarifies that prayer should be verbalized aloud, as the devil "does not have the ability to read your mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>, and the "sword of the spirit" is the verbalized word of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>. He also mentions the use of anointing oil, which he considers a "tool" or "weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a> because its recipe was divinely commanded, carrying the "fragrance of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.

## Current Work and Reflections

Daniel Mastral now dedicates his life to sharing his testimony and insights through books, videos, and public speaking, aiming to enlighten and protect people from spiritual dangers. He advises his followers to live "step by step," avoiding suffering in advance by not fearing prophecies but rather strengthening their faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>. His work provides guidance on how to interpret biblical prophecies and navigate the complexities of the spiritual world.

One of his continuing struggles is understanding human corruption when faced with power, fame, or money. He questions how spiritual leaders can "be sold for so much little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:13">[03:35:13]</a> when their eternal fate is at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:19">[03:35:19]</a>. This remains an unanswered question for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:24">[03:35:24]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of faith, especially during difficult times like the pandemic. He highlights that his son's diary, which chronicles his battles with depression, is available for free download on his website, aiming to help others coping with similar struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:56">[03:32:56]</a>. His message is one of strength in God, renewal of hope, and finding comfort in faith to overcome even the deepest, unseen wounds of the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:01">[03:36:01]</a>.

## Current Conflicts and Eschatological Interpretations
Recent events, including the war in [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]], are perceived by some as rapidly unfolding developments. From an eschatological viewpoint, the ongoing conflict in [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] is seen as alarming, with some interpretations suggesting it could lead to a Third World War between [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] and the Palestinians, or Arabs in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Prophecies from Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Jesus are studied to understand these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Some theories propose that three world wars are necessary for a "New World Order" to be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The first two World Wars, according to this interpretation, were designed to create and strengthen an antithesis to capitalism (communism, embodied by the Soviet Union), leading to a global division (thesis vs. antithesis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The third world war is predicted to start between Jews and Arabs, specifically Jews and fundamentalist Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

This predicted war is believed to culminate in chaos, from which an "antichrist" figure would emerge to offer economic and social solutions, bringing about a new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

## Atrocities and Regional Tensions
The recent invasion of [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] by terrorists, such as Hamas, involved severe atrocities including kidnapping and killing civilians, beheading babies, molesting children, and raping women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]]'s response to such aggressive acts was deemed unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. This response is aimed at destroying the terrorist group and preventing agreements, such as the one between [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

Extremist groups do not desire peace; they seek to destroy [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]], with [[geopolitical_alliances_in_middle_east | Iran]] playing a significant role in financing these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. The potential for the conflict to expand, with [[geopolitical_alliances_in_middle_east | Hezbollah]] joining the fight and [[geopolitical_alliances_in_middle_east | Iran]]'s involvement, could draw in the [[geopolitical_alliances_in_middle_east | United States]] and Russia, potentially triggering a world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

## The Religious Nature of the Conflict
The current conflict is fundamentally a [[geopolitics_and_religion_relationship | spiritual war]] driven by religious reasons, specifically between Jews and fundamentalist Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. It's important to note that not every [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islamic country]] is Arab, and not all Muslims are radical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Research suggests only 15% to 20% of Muslims are extremists, but this still represents a significant number (around 320 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. The fastest-growing religion globally is Islam, partly due to high fertility rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

Radical Islam believes that Islam must be the world's only religion, leading to the persecution of other faiths, including Christianity and Judaism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

## Historical Roots of Anti-Israel Extremism
The deep-seated hatred against [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] by some Palestinian and Arab groups stems from a specific [[islamic_history_and_cultural_influence | Islamic theology]] developed by Alm Vard, dating back to 1000 years before Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. This theology distinguishes between "Dar al-Islam" (house of Islam), where Islam rules, and "Dar al-Harb" (house of the sword), which are territories to be conquered by Jihad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

Under this theory, any land once ruled by Islam (such as Jerusalem, conquered in 638 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:16">[03:06:16]</a>) can never again be governed by non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. This means extremists fundamentally reject the existence of the State of [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]], making a two-state solution impossible in their view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. This perspective fuels the desire for the "extermination of [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.

Historically, since its founding in 1948, [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] has faced extermination attempts from neighboring Arab countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. Despite having a much smaller population and less military strength initially, [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] miraculously prevailed in these wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

## Geopolitical Polarization and Narratives
The world is increasingly polarized regarding the [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]]-Palestine conflict, with governments and people taking sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. The far-left is often aligned with Palestine and Hamas, while right-wing or capitalist countries tend to align with [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. This polarization is seen as a continuation of the "thesis-antithesis" dynamic, keeping people divided and unaware of a larger, subtle plan for a "new world order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

Media narratives also play a crucial role, often constructing opinions against [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. Anti-Semitism is predicted to return with full force, disguised by new narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.

## The Question of Land Ownership: A Biblical Perspective
To understand the land ownership issue, one must consider the Holy Bible as a historical record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

*   **Abrahamic Covenant**: Around 2000 BC, God promised Abraham's descendants the land of Canaan, which is present-day Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
*   **Exodus and Conquest**: The Israelites, after 400 years of slavery in Egypt, were led by Moses to reclaim this Promised Land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. Joshua led them in conquering seven nations residing there, with no descendants from these nations remaining in the territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Jerusalem as Capital**: King David founded Jerusalem and made it the indivisible capital of [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. Solomon built the first temple there, on the site where the Dome of the Rock now stands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   **Exile and Return**: The temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (586 BC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>, rebuilt after 70 years, and later improved by Herod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
*   **Roman Destruction and Diaspora**: In 70 AD, the Romans destroyed the second temple and massacred over a million Jews during a revolt, leading to the Jewish diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Emperor Hadrian (132 AD) banned Jews from Jerusalem and prohibited their religious practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. Over centuries, Jews were scattered globally and persecuted, with an estimated 13 million deaths between 70 AD and the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.
*   **Ottoman Rule and British Mandate**: After four centuries, Christian Crusades attempted to reclaim the Holy Land from [[islamic_history_and_cultural_influence | Islamic rule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. The Ottoman Turks then governed Palestine from 1517 to 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>. After WWI, the British took control, dividing Palestine and establishing Transjordan for non-Jews, with the western part reserved for Jewish migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.
*   **Re-establishment of Israel**: In 1948, with the UN resolution, [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] became a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>.

## Palestine and Gaza Strip
The Palestinians have a right to a state, and many Palestinians in the West Bank (Cis Jordan) support a political solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. However, extremist groups like Hamas in the Gaza Strip do not seek land but rather the extermination of the Jewish people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. If [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] were to lay down its weapons, it would cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

The residents of Palestine today are Arabs brought by the Ottoman Turkish Empire from other Arab countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. The Gaza Strip itself belonged to Egypt from 1948 to 1967 before [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] took control after the Six-Day War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. In 2005, [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] removed all 9,000 Jewish residents from Gaza in an attempt to foster peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Hamas won elections in Gaza in 2006 and has since used the territory to attack [[the_impact_of_israels_historical_conflicts | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

## Conclusion and Call to Action
The global events, including the current Middle East conflicts, are seen as significant and potentially leading to the end of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. It is argued that these events should prompt individuals to reflect on their spiritual lives and seek God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:50">[03:17:50]</a>.

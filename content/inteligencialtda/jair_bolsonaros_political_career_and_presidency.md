Jair Bolsonaro's journey into [[Brazilian politics and governance | Brazilian politics]] was unexpected, beginning with a controversial statement and evolving into a long career in Congress before his presidency.

## Early Life and Military Career
Jair Bolsonaro was born in 1955 and grew up in Eldorado Paulista, where he attended public school [00:07:42]. He is one of seven siblings [00:08:12]. His father was a "practical dentist" [00:10:09] and his family, though large, lived a "very healthy" life without modern comforts like cell phones [00:08:49]. Bolsonaro describes a childhood spent playing in the street, barefoot, rollerblading, and flying kites [00:09:23].

At 15, Bolsonaro fell in love with the army, becoming the first military man in his family [00:11:58]. He spent a total of 15 years in the [[Military experience and early life of Jair Bolsonaro | Brazilian Army]] [00:12:22]. During his military academy years (1975), he participated in various sports including basketball, football, and military pentathlon [00:13:03]. Within the military career, officers can typically reach the rank of Colonel, and about four per class become General [00:13:47]. Bolsonaro's early career included serving on the border in Nioaque, Mato Grosso do Sul, where he became the head of the plant due to a prior electricity course [00:17:19]. He also contributed crossword puzzles to the newspaper "Estado de São Paulo" in the 1970s [01:09:09].

## Entry into Politics
Bolsonaro's entry into [[Brazilian Political Landscape | politics]] was unintentional [01:14:19]. It began in 1986 with an article he wrote for *Veja* magazine, which led to disciplinary action against him as an active military member [00:25:26]. This incident, however, gave him public visibility [00:25:56].

In 1988, he ran as a councilor for the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) in Rio de Janeiro and was the most voted candidate from his party [02:26:02]. Two years later, he launched himself as a federal deputy, serving seven consecutive terms for a total of 28 years in the Chamber of Deputies [02:36:36]. Overall, he states he has been in politics for 30 years (2 as councilor, 28 as federal deputy), plus 15 years in the army, totaling 45 years in public life before his presidency [02:46:41].

## Presidency
Bolsonaro was elected President in 2018, a victory he admits "no one believed" possible, even at home [01:43:00]. His campaign was notably low-budget, spending R$2.4 million in 2018, and he had only 7 seconds of television time [02:45:32].

Upon taking office in 2019, Bolsonaro prioritized forming a technical ministry [00:40:54]. He cited figures like Tarcísio Gomes de Freitas (Infrastructure Minister) and Marcos Pontes (Science and Technology Minister) as examples of technical appointments, contrasting this with past governments where ministerial positions were often political exchanges to please parties [00:41:00], [00:42:12]. His government initially reduced the number of ministries from 39 to 22, later increasing to 23 [00:46:56], [00:47:00].

### Economic and Social Policies
During his presidency, Bolsonaro's administration focused on:
*   **Debureaucratization and Deregulation**: The Economic Freedom Law (2019) aimed to simplify business openings, allowing businesses to open if city halls didn't respond within 30 days [00:49:38]. Regulatory standards were reduced by 90% to ease burdens on businesses [00:50:32].
*   **Infrastructure**: Investments were made in highways, completing projects that had been stalled for decades, often utilizing army engineering battalions [00:46:02], [00:32:00]. Airport and port concessions were also pursued [00:46:41].
*   **Cost Reduction**: The government aimed to cut "absurd" expenses, including controversial consultancy contracts and wasteful spending, such as R$50 million for teaching Indigenous people how to use Bitcoin [00:47:05], [00:47:25].
*   **Lei Rouanet (Culture Incentive Law)**: Bolsonaro's government reduced the tax waiver for this law, arguing it should help new artists rather than established ones [00:48:30]. This policy led to criticism from the artistic community [00:49:25].
*   **Fuel Prices**: His government reduced fuel prices by lowering state (ICMS) and federal taxes, leading to a significant drop in gasoline prices [00:56:45]. This was presented as a legislative change, not an artificial interference like past "stroke of a pen" price reductions that accumulated debt for Petrobras [00:58:17].
*   **Agriculture and Food Security**: Bolsonaro's administration continued investments in agribusiness, a sector he notes became a global power after the 1970s [02:05:05]. Efforts included titling land for 420,000 small farmers, allowing them to seek financing and reducing land invasions by groups like the MST [02:34:00], [02:34:40]. He also mentions future plans for fish farming in Lake Itaipu and exploring Brazil's vast fertilizer reserves currently located on indigenous lands [02:08:00], [02:15:00].
*   **Social Aid**: The "Auxílio Brasil" program paid R$600 per month, three times more than the previous Bolsa Família [02:50:00]. Bolsonaro argues this significantly reduced hunger, making it "very easy" for people to register and receive aid [02:51:00].

### Controversies and Criticisms Faced by Bolsonaro
Bolsonaro's presidency was marked by numerous controversies and criticisms, particularly regarding:
*   **Pandemic Management**: He describes the pandemic as the "most difficult moment" of his life [02:33:27]. While his government declared an emergency in February 2020 and acquired vaccines, he criticized states and municipalities for excessive restrictive measures ("stay at home" policies) that he believed harmed the economy and mental health [02:06:00], [02:06:20]. He consistently opposed closing schools [02:07:48] and voiced skepticism about vaccine side effects, famously stating "the guy turns into an alligator" as a "figure of speech" [02:10:13]. He claims his administration was transparent, providing emergency aid and maintaining jobs to prevent social chaos [02:34:00].
*   **Relationship with the Press and "Fake News"**: Bolsonaro states that the mainstream media (e.g., Globo, Record, SBT) has lost credibility by taking political sides and focusing only on negative news [01:41:14]. He argues that he doesn't need to create fake news about the PT because "he will tell the truth" [01:39:21]. He sees media regulation as a dangerous form of "prior censorship" [01:40:09]. His administration "garroted advertising expenses" to official government propaganda, leading to media backlash [01:12:39].
*   **"Secret Budget" (RP9 Amendments)**: Bolsonaro explains that this budget mechanism, criticized as a "secret budget" by opponents, was created by Parliament in 2020 [01:32:54]. He vetoed it, but his veto was overturned by Congress, including PT deputies [01:33:23]. He clarifies that the funds are not in his hands but are allocated by a rapporteur to specific municipalities or states, without the parliamentarian's name being public [01:37:17]. He argues that if he were "buying votes" with it, he wouldn't allocate funds to PT deputies who never voted with his government [01:36:35].
*   **Personal Finances and Real Estate**: Bolsonaro addressed accusations related to his family's real estate purchases, allegedly made with cash. He asserts that "currency current" on property registrations does not necessarily mean cash [01:45:50]. He mentions a 2017 investigation by the Prosecutor General that found no "minimum signs" of irregularity in his properties [01:46:03]. He attributes these accusations to attempts to "wear him down" [01:44:59].
*   **Rachadinha (Scheme of Salary Kickbacks)**: Bolsonaro reframes this accusation by pointing to the "Mais Médicos" program of the PT government, where Cuban doctors received 12,000 per month but 9,500 went to Fidel Castro, totaling over 1 billion per year for the Cuban dictatorship [02:25:00]. He dismisses the "rachadinha" accusations against his son Flávio as a continuous attack [02:30:50].
*   **Social Agendas**: He defends his stance on social issues, stating he is not homophobic and supports gay marriage ("everyone has the right to suffer too") [00:36:10], [00:36:41]. He opposes "gender ideology" in schools, arguing against material "not compatible with age" and children changing sex without parental consent [00:36:03], [02:21:40]. He also defends reducing the age of criminal responsibility, stating that 16 or 17-year-olds who commit crimes should face consequences [02:18:11].

## Reflections and Challenges
Bolsonaro maintains that his government is characterized by a "zero corruption" approach [01:48:50]. He acknowledges that he has "improved" his language, reducing swearing, in response to public feedback [02:46:19]. He encourages voting, urging people not to choose "null" or "abstention," as this can lead to leaders governing without a majority mandate [02:45:11].

He discusses what he views as [[Controversies and criticisms faced by Bolsonaro | false narratives]] against him, such as claims of being a cannibal (referring to an isolated indigenous ritual he witnessed 30 years ago) [02:16:54], [02:17:16], or disliking Northeasterners (his wife's family is from Ceará) [02:48:10], or black people (his father-in-law is "black and Indian" and he saved a drowning black man) [02:48:15]. He claims these narratives are used by opponents who lack positive achievements [02:48:56].

On [[Comparison of Jair Bolsonaro and Lula da Silva | Lula's]] past statements, Bolsonaro highlights Lula's alleged support for abortion (despite recent denials) [01:55:25] and drug legalization [02:09:49]. He also points to a 2009 Lula decree (PNDH3) that allegedly promoted "gender ideology" themes [02:10:52]. He accuses Lula of having changed his stance on these issues for political gain [02:56:43].

Bolsonaro admits to having changed his own views over time, specifically moving from a statist and nationalizing position to one favoring privatization, having observed that a "bloated state does not work" [01:57:24]. However, he notes that further privatizations were hampered by the pandemic and parliamentary resistance [01:57:52].

He believes that after the upcoming elections, depending on the winner, there will either be an end to current tensions or an "escalation" of misunderstandings [02:52:20]. He reiterates his belief that he has had "little friction with Parliament" and expects "almost none" if reelected due to his party's large caucus [02:47:20].

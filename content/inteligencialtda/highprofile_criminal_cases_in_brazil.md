This article explores various high-profile criminal cases in Brazil, drawing on insights and experiences from a forensic expert. It delves into the details of investigations, forensic techniques, and the psychological aspects of the individuals involved in these cases.

## General Overview of Criminal Investigations
The program often discusses major crimes in Brazil and worldwide, with guests sharing their experiences and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The importance of public participation through questions is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

A key debate revolves around whether to give media attention to criminals, as it can inadvertently glamorize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Examples like [[Suzane von Richthofen case | Suzane von Richthofen]] having fan clubs and the "Maniac of the Park" receiving letters illustrate this concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. There's a view that excessive media exposure can turn criminals into "heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Forensic Investigation and Psychopathy
The program features an expert, "Salad," who discusses various aspects of forensic investigation. He explains that psychopathy is a personality trait, not simply being a "bad" or "unbalanced" person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>. Society is "full of psychopaths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, but few develop an aggressive side toward humans due to "brakes" acquired through family, education, religion, and moral parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. When these brakes break, it's hard to reinstate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.

[!note] Types of Psychopathy Development
Psychopathy can develop differently; for example, one psychopath might join a criminal organization like the PCC, while another might be born into a Buddhist monastery and become a demanding "great guru" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. This means psychopathy can manifest in various ways, from corporate "executioners" (like Steve Jobs, described as an "executioner" for his demanding behavior) to destructive family members or spiritual leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

## Featured High-Profile Cases

### [[Suzane von Richthofen case | Suzane von Richthofen]]
This case is a prominent example of [[notable_criminal_cases_and_investigations_in_brazil | high-profile criminal cases]] in Brazil. The expert was involved from the beginning, arriving at the scene while the bodies were still present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

#### The Crime Scene Investigation
The Homicide Department and Personal Protection (DHPP) in São Paulo handles cases of unknown authorship and preserved crime scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>. The scene where Suzane's parents, Manfred and Marísia, were killed, was on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>.
*   **Initial Scene**: The first impression was a robbery-murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. A firearm was found, and the couple appeared to have been surprised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Discrepancies**: However, the violence was extreme, with Marísia suffering multiple skull fractures, indicating "51 extreme coups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. Manfred also had significant head trauma, cracking his skull base, suggesting "brutal violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. The wounds suggested blunt objects, not firearms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Simulated Robbery**: Jewelry was scattered in a "ridiculous" manner, clearly attempting to simulate a robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>. A false-bottom closet containing valuable jewelry and a real gun was untouched, indicating someone familiar with the house was involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>. The way items were spread could even pinpoint where the person stood while throwing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>.
*   **House Tidiness**: The house was impeccably tidy, which was the family's standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. This contrasted with the "mess" in the office, where Suzane's father had a folder containing a large sum of money, which was found cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. Suzane claimed she didn't touch anything in the office, but the expert notes the folder was facing down and she would have had to touch it to see the cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.

#### Suzane's Behavior and Psychological Profile
Suzane's behavior immediately after the crime raised suspicion.
*   **Alibi**: She and Daniel Cravinhos (her boyfriend) presented an alibi, claiming they were at a motel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. However, they produced a motel receipt, which is unusual for patrons to request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.
*   **Lack of Empathy**: Investigators noted her "coldness and indifference" at the police station, hugging and kissing Daniel after her parents' murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:53">[01:44:53]</a>. This behavior, described as an "absurdity above any human being normal," surprised police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:27">[02:12:27]</a>.
*   **Seduction and Persuasion**: She is described as "very smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>, "extremely seductive," and charismatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. This seduction is not carnal but persuasive, allowing her to gain trust and influence others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>. This trait is seen as a key aspect of her potential psychopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.
*   **Confession**: Suzane confessed during her temporary arrest, likely to benefit from a lighter sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:08">[02:10:08]</a>.
*   **Premeditation vs. Explosion**: The expert believes the crime was premeditated rather than an "explosion" of emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:16">[02:27:16]</a>. Evidence suggesting premeditation includes purchasing an electric saw a week before the murder (claimed for gardening, but likely for dismemberment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:08">[02:28:08]</a>. Her initial story of being abused by her father was also questioned, with her testimony revealing she lost her virginity to Daniel, not abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:49">[01:53:49]</a>.

[!info] The "Voice of the Dead"
The expert explains his role as giving a "voice" to the victims, as crime scenes and bodies "speak" a "silent language" that specialists learn to interpret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of observation and not just following protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:55">[02:56:55]</a>.

### [[Elize Matsunaga case | Elize Matsunaga]]
This is another [[notable_criminal_cases_and_investigations_in_brazil | high-profile court case]] discussed. The expert was called into the case after the body parts were already found, focusing on the investigation in the apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:05">[02:04:05]</a>.

#### Investigation Details
*   **Luminol and Evidence**: The investigation involved using luminol to detect blood traces in the apartment, especially in the master suite's masonry bathtub, which was considered the most suitable place for dismemberment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:50">[02:04:50]</a>.
*   **Mattress Change**: A key piece of evidence came from the maid, who revealed Elize had asked her to change the mattress in the bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:51">[02:06:51]</a>. This mattress, likely containing blood, was then located at the maid's house, and luminol confirmed blood traces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>.
*   **Simulated Reproduction**: A simulated reproduction of the crime was performed, with Elize describing her version of events. She claimed a fight with Marcos, leading to her shooting him, then dismembering the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>. However, forensic analysis contradicted her account, particularly regarding the distance of the shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:42">[02:17:42]</a>.
    *   **Shot Distance**: Elize claimed she shot Marcos from 1.92 meters away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:33">[02:17:33]</a>. However, the lack of gunshot residue ("scorching," "smoke," or "tattoo" marks) on Marcos's body indicated a shot from a distance greater than 30 cm, making Elize's claim inconsistent with forensic findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:48">[02:17:48]</a>. The presence of a "tattoo" mark on Marcos indicated a very short distance, contradicting Elize's statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>.
    *   **Victim's Position**: The Coroner noted that Marcos was likely in a "privileged" situation, caught by surprise with "no chance of defense," which contradicts Elize's story of an argument and him being able to react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:46">[02:23:46]</a>.
*   **Dismemberment**: The Coroner's report on the dismemberment indicated cuts made by someone with "surgical knowledge" (knees and abdominal region) and other cuts made by someone without such knowledge (upper limbs, neck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:32">[02:50:32]</a>. This suggests at least two people were involved in the dismemberment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>. Elize's claim that she waited to dismember him to avoid bleeding (as blood wouldn't coagulate) was also dismissed, as a nurse (her profession) would know how to stop bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:37">[02:54:37]</a>.

#### Motivation and Psychological Analysis
Elize's motivation is viewed as a "contractual" relationship rather than love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>. She was a "focused" person who desired to escape a humble past and climb socially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:34">[03:37:34]</a>. Marcos provided her with a life of luxury and experiences she never imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:52">[03:42:52]</a>. The discovery of his betrayal, especially through another woman, is seen as the "explosion" that led to the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

[!example] Forensic Science and Investigation
Forensic experts use specialized tests like luminol to detect latent blood traces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> and PK Cut, originally for detecting blood in feces, which can detect human blood at nanogram levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:10">[03:36:10]</a>. DNA extraction from blood can identify whose blood it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:39">[03:39:39]</a>. Even cleaned surfaces can retain traces in crevices or porous materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Forensic lights are used to stimulate molecules and reveal hidden substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:15">[03:41:15]</a>.

### The Cannibals of Garanhuns
This extremely disturbing case involved Jorge and Bruna, who committed cannibalistic acts.
*   **Jorge's Schizophrenia**: Jorge, diagnosed with schizophrenia, heard voices that commanded him to "purify the earth" by killing "useless people" who didn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:26">[03:14:26]</a>. He documented his crimes in a diary and filmed himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:04">[03:15:04]</a>.
*   **Cannibalism**: They ate the victims' flesh because the body was considered "sacred" and could not be discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:45">[03:16:45]</a>. They even made and sold "coxinha" pastries containing human flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:56">[03:16:56]</a>.
*   **Bruna's Role**: Bruna, who became part of a love triangle with Jorge and his wife, was drawn into his madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:42">[03:14:42]</a>. Her psychopathic mind, characterized by a lack of empathy, enabled her participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:30">[03:16:30]</a>.

### Other Notable Cases Mentioned
*   **Pedrinho Matador (Little Pete the Killer)**: Mentioned in the context of whether to bring criminals onto media platforms, with concerns about "glamorizing" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>.
*   **[[Elisa Samúdio case | Elisa Samúdio]] and [[Dori case | Dori]]**: Referenced as past subjects discussed on the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Father Robson**: The expert analyzed his profile, finding him "one of the coldest guys out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:02">[03:04:02]</a>.
*   **Tayná and Bel Cases**: Referenced as cases where the expert's analyses sometimes drew criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:53">[03:03:53]</a>.
*   **Henry Case**: A well-known case mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:41">[03:32:41]</a>.
*   **Evandro Case**: The expert expresses interest in doing an episode on this case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:01">[03:27:01]</a>.

These discussions highlight the complex nature of [[highprofile_court_cases_and_judicial_proceedings | judicial proceedings]] and the crucial role of forensic science in uncovering the truth. The challenges faced by the [[the_influence_and_actions_of_brazilian_judiciary_and_supreme_court_decisions | Brazilian judiciary]] and law enforcement in these [[notable_criminal_cases_and_investigations_in_brazil | criminal investigations]] are also implicitly demonstrated.

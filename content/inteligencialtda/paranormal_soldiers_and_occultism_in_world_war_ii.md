The topic of paranormal soldiers and occultism during World War II explores the historical and alleged efforts by various nations, notably the United States and Nazi Germany, to integrate psychic abilities, mystical beliefs, and secret societies into military strategies and the [[development_of_super_soldiers_and_mind_control_projects | development of super soldiers and mind control projects]] [00:00:37]. These accounts often blend documented projects with sensationalized theories and have significantly influenced popular culture.

## American Investigations into the Paranormal

The United States military pursued [[research_into_unexplained_phenomena | research into unexplained phenomena]] and psychic abilities, particularly from the 1970s onward, often influenced by perceived Soviet advancements [00:16:03].

### Project Stargate
The primary project, **Project Stargate**, aimed to create psychics for the army, based at Fort Meade [00:15:42]. This project is documented in the book *The Men Who Stared at Goats* [00:15:48], which, unlike its comedic film adaptation, delves into real events [00:19:43].

*   **Origins:** The US became interested after believing Russians used "paranormal spies" who could leak atomic codes by accessing dreams, similar to the concept of *Inception* [00:16:07].
*   **Development:** General Albert Stubblebine commissioned Colonel Jim Channon to research this [00:17:20]. Channon, after two years, returned with a document called "First Earth Battalion," outlining protocols for paranormal activities [00:17:49].
*   **Remote Viewing:** Scientists at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), including physicist Hal Puthoff, developed "remote viewing" [00:18:15]. This technique allowed individuals like Ingo Swann to perceive distant objects or events through drawings and extrasensory perception [00:19:11]. The success rate reportedly increased from 20% to 70% after analyzing brainwave patterns associated with correct guesses [00:19:22].
*   **Key Participants:**
    *   **Uri Geller:** The famous illusionist Uri Geller participated in the early phase of Project Stargate, known for bending forks [00:19:29]. Geller, a former member of the Israeli army, claims to have used his abilities to stop armored vehicles or lights in buildings [00:20:50]. He also allegedly predicted the Munich Massacre and refused to work for the Israeli military after his warnings were ignored [00:21:14].
    *   **Joseph McMoneagle and Major Ed Dames:** These individuals were also key figures in the project. Major Ed Dames, in particular, is noted for using remote viewing to find his ideal wife in Poland and reportedly winning lotteries and breaking casinos [02:26:25].
*   **Objectives:** The ultimate goal of Project Stargate was not just remote viewing, but also to [[development_of_super_soldiers_and_mind_control_projects | develop abilities]] like killing a goat merely by staring at it [02:22:01] and even passing through walls [02:29:50]. While Ronson, the skeptical investigative journalist for *The Men Who Stared at Goats*, claims to have witnessed a mouse being knocked unconscious but not killed by staring [02:28:33], the higher claims remain in the realm of speculation.
*   **Continuity:** Despite official statements of closure due to low success rates (a "limited hangout" strategy to conceal continued research) [02:39:59], the project reportedly continued, especially after 9/11/2001, into its 10th generation of "paranormal soldiers" [02:24:22].

### Mind Control and Project Talent
The US also engaged in [[development_of_super_soldiers_and_mind_control_projects | mind control projects]], notably **MK Ultra**, which is a documented CIA project, not a conspiracy theory [02:45:40].

*   **Origins:** MK Ultra's roots are traced back to German scientists brought over during Operation Paperclip after WWII, including experts in mind control like Josef Mengele [02:45:10]. The "K" in MK Ultra is thought to refer to "kontroll" (control in German) [02:46:20].
*   **Methods:** The project aimed to manipulate individuals through substances and brainwashing to commit atrocities [02:46:05]. It also involved "trauma-based mind control" and "satanic ritual abuse" (SRA), combining science and occultism [03:39:19].
*   **Project Talent:** Allegedly a sub-project of MK Ultra, Project Talent focused on creating super soldiers by inducing dissociative identity disorder in children through severe childhood traumas [05:51:57]. The idea was to create multiple personalities: one an ordinary individual, and another a super assassin who would not know who sent them [05:53:07]. This technique was supposedly aided by substances like LSD to amplify pain and prevent fainting during the "fractionation" process [06:09:23].
*   **Robert Duncan O'Fin:** O'Fin claims to be a guinea pig of a super soldier project. He states his memories were false, having nightmares of war despite never serving [05:08:53]. He discovered his father, a secret agent, offered him to Project Talent at age six [05:16:15]. O'Fin alleges a German woman named Elga, involved in the MK Ultra project via Operation Paperclip, was controlling his mind telepathically, effectively "piloting" him [05:22:04]. His experience is said to be similar to the plot of *The Bourne Identity* [05:07:29]. His claims include walking through walls, superhuman strength, and implants in his body that show up on MRI scans [05:51:56]. These abilities are sometimes attributed to spiritual forces or alliances with spiritual beings [03:59:58].

## Nazi Occultism and Super Soldiers

The Nazi regime, particularly under Heinrich Himmler, was deeply invested in occultism and mysticism to justify its ideologies and create a superior race [02:51:07].

*   **Mystical Foundation:** The Germans held a mystical belief that they were descendants of Atlantean civilizations and Nordic gods (like Odin and Thor), possessing "divine DNA" and exceptional skills [02:53:30]. This ideology was heavily influenced by theosophy, particularly Helena Blavatsky's ideas, which linked Aryans to Atlantean heirs [02:56:07].
*   **[[Influence of secret societies in Nazi Germany | Influence of secret societies in Nazi Germany]]:** The Thule Society, a secret society, played a crucial role in these developments [02:59:16]. They sought to mobilize a spiritual energy called "vril" to make Germans invincible and create weapons of mass destruction [02:58:34].
*   **Sacred Relics:** Hitler and Himmler believed that possessing certain sacred relics would grant them invincibility and establish a "Third Reich" (Third Roman Empire) [02:59:16].
    *   **Spear of Longinus:** This spear, believed to have pierced Christ's side, was among the first items Hitler seized upon invading Austria [03:04:12]. Hitler believed that with this spear and the crown of emperors, he would be invincible [03:10:52].
    *   **Ark of the Covenant:** The Nazis also pursued the Ark of the Covenant, as depicted in *Indiana Jones*, believing it to be a weapon of mass destruction that would unleash divine power [03:07:48].

[!INFO] **The Ark of the Covenant as a Weapon**
A theory by Chris Thomas posits the Ark of the Covenant as a weapon of mass destruction, capable of editing the "akashic record" (a spiritual blockchain of the universe's events) [02:17:21]. This theory suggests that evil alien beings, who purportedly forged archaeological records to appear as human creators, seek the Ark to permanently alter history and present themselves as God [02:14:18]. God is said to have hidden the Ark to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands [02:18:14].

*   **[[Role of astrology and mysticism in military strategies during WWII | Racial Superiority Justification]]:** The belief in their divine ancestry justified the Nazi ideology of a superior Aryan race, destined to rule the world [03:40:17]. Their adoption of the swastika, a common symbol in Indian and Iranian cultures, was modified (rotated 45 degrees to the left) to signify constant change and the extraction of power from the "dark hand," symbolizing an alignment with evil [03:27:53].

## Allied Counter-Occult Efforts

Facing the Nazi occult threat, the British initiated their own mystical defense.

*   **The Mystical Battle of Britain:** In 1939, British occultist Dion Fortune, a member of the Golden Dawn society, formed a team of magicians to combat the Germans through magic rather than conventional warfare [03:17:16].
    *   **Tactics:** Due to wartime restrictions and the bombing of her temple, Fortune's group communicated via letters, meditating remotely at noon on Sundays [03:52:16]. Their goal was to spiritually strengthen British troops' morale [03:53:51] and, in response to German aerial attacks, to bring forth clouds and fog to impede the Luftwaffe [03:57:55]. These rituals reportedly resulted in real fog that saved British forces in several battles [04:04:08].
    *   **Prophecy:** Fortune concluded her rituals in 1943, stating that the war would be won and that a "United Nations" (UN) would emerge, which she visualized years before its actual formation [03:47:48].
*   **Psychic Espionage:** The British mystics engaged in psychic espionage to uncover information from Hitler's astrologers, anticipating Nazi strategies [03:53:51].

## Post-War Continuity and Pop Culture

The influence of these alleged programs extends beyond WWII, shaping conspiracy theories and popular entertainment.

*   **Operation Paperclip:** The US's Operation Paperclip, which brought top German scientists to the US after WWII, included not only aerospace engineers but also occultists and experts in mind control [03:45:10]. This continued German [[research into unexplained phenomena | research into unexplained phenomena]] and the [[development_of_super_soldiers_and_mind_control_projects | development of super soldiers and mind control projects]] in the US.
    *   **Jack Parsons:** A rocket scientist who co-founded JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), Parsons was also a representative of the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), a secret society led by Aleister Crowley [04:26:07]. He engaged in sexual magic rituals, such as the "Rite of Babalon," attempting to spiritually conceive a "Divine child" [04:47:04], drawing inspiration from ancient myths like Horus [04:17:17].
    *   **L. Ron Hubbard:** The founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, a science fiction writer, was involved with Parsons in these rituals [04:21:40]. The alleged goal was to initiate a "New World Order" and the "Age of Horus" [04:55:04].
    *   **Donald Trump's Birth:** A theory suggests that Donald Trump, born in 1946 during a lunar eclipse and blood moon, was the "Moonchild" sought by Parsons and Crowley [03:11:00].
*   **[[The Influence of Occultism in Music and Pop Culture | Pop Culture Influence]]:** Many of these themes have permeated popular culture, particularly in movies and comics.
    *   **Comic Books:** Stan Lee and DC Comics were reportedly inspired by these mystical stories and legends, with examples such as Marvel's Hydra (resembling occult Nazi groups) and the Illuminati [03:03:00].
    *   **Movies and Series:**
        *   *The Men Who Stared at Goats* (Project Stargate) [00:15:48]
        *   *Stranger Things* (Montauk Project, Demogorgon from the Montauk Monster) [01:44:06]
        *   *The Matrix* (spoon bending) [01:57:00]
        *   *Under the Silver Lake* and David Lynch's films (Hollywood's sinister side) [01:13:51]
        *   *The Manchurian Candidate* (mind control, false memories, sleeper assassins) [01:13:51]. The concept of "Ghost Writers" – highly classified soldiers or operatives operating in black attire and vehicles – is also mentioned [01:59:00].
        *   *Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (Illuminati) [01:48:47]
        *   *Akira* and *Neon Evangelion* (paranormal children commanding bio-structures) [01:48:56]
        *   *The Three-Body Problem* (alien interference in human technology) [01:40:17]
    *   **Celebrity Alter Egos:** The concept of multiple personalities, possibly resulting from trauma, is linked to celebrity alter egos in the music industry (e.g., Beyoncé's Sasha Fierce, Lady Gaga's Dom Calderone, Britney Spears' multiple personalities) [01:46:00]. Mel Gibson himself discusses his "Bjorne" alter ego, a "Viking soldier" who takes control [01:12:47].

The blending of historical fact, alleged government projects, and occult theories continues to fuel interest in the clandestine aspects of military history and the potential for [[Spiritual Warfare and Demonic Influence | spiritual warfare]] and [[understanding_the_psychological_effects_of_spiritual_warfare | psychological manipulation]] in conflict.

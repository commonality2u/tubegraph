Sleep deprivation can have significant and dangerous consequences, affecting an individual's physical, mental, and cognitive health. The impact can range from subtle changes in daily life to severe medical emergencies [00:22:13].

## Personal Account of Severe Sleep Deprivation

A personal account highlights the severe effects of chronic sleep deprivation. For 7 to 8 years, an individual consistently slept only 4:30 to 5:30 hours a night [00:22:42]. This long-term sleep restriction led to the feeling of having "aged a lot" and becoming physically unwell [00:22:13].

### Physical and Mental Health Impacts
Chronic lack of sleep made basic tasks difficult and affected overall well-being:
*   **Loss of Desire** The individual lost the desire to engage in activities they once enjoyed [02:23:13].
*   **Physical Symptoms** Symptoms such as feeling "rhinestones around" (stress/anxiety) and experiencing acid reflux due to nervousness became common [00:23:17].
*   **Physical Weakness and Injuries** The body started to give in, leading to loss of strength and an increase in injuries. Training, which previously served as meditation, became exhausting [00:37:47].
*   **[[Role of stress and stress management | Mental Exhaustion]]** The routine became unsustainable, leading to mental exhaustion and an inability to zero out the mind during activities like training [00:23:01, 00:23:33].

### Cognitive and Memory Impairment
A particularly frightening experience demonstrated the severe cognitive effects:
*   **Memory Lapses and Disorientation** While driving and dining, the individual experienced profound memory lapses, including feeling a "déjà vu" (seeing something new as already seen) and "jamais vu" (erasing recent memories). This led to disorientation, not knowing where they were or what was happening, and repeatedly asking "where am I?" [00:24:14, 00:24:30, 00:24:51, 00:26:30].
*   **Altered Perception of Time** During the episode, time perception was completely distorted. An hour felt like "hours and hours of dawn," and minutes seemed like much longer periods [03:33:33, 03:37:37].
*   **Medical Emergency** The individual, a doctor, immediately recognized the severity, suspecting a stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage due to symptoms like a lightning bolt sensation in the head and transient global amnesia [00:25:50]. This acute situation highlighted the serious risks associated with extreme sleep deprivation, similar to the dangers faced by night shift workers with inverted circadian cycles [00:22:34].

### Long-term Consequences
The incident served as a wake-up call, emphasizing that chronic sleep restriction is "very dangerous" and can lead to serious health issues, especially for individuals genetically predisposed to certain conditions [00:22:24]. It can even cause "absent seizures" or memory lapses, necessitating significant rest [03:32:31, 03:32:33].

## Addressing Sleep Deprivation

To mitigate the consequences of severe sleep deprivation, several strategies were implemented:
*   **Lifestyle Adjustments** Recognizing the need for change, the family moved closer to work to reduce commute times and allow for more sleep [00:23:01, 01:18:18].
*   **Setting Boundaries** Learning to say "no" to excessive work commitments became crucial. Previously, the doctor would accept every patient, leading to 12-hour workdays akin to residency shifts [00:34:42, 00:34:50]. This often meant working after hours on administrative tasks and patient follow-ups, creating a "spiral" of endless work [00:35:10, 03:52:00].
*   **Team Support** Building a support team of nutritionists, doctors, and physical education professionals helps manage workload and ensures that the individual does not feel compelled to take on every responsibility, allowing for reduced work hours and more rest [00:50:06, 00:50:09].
*   **Prioritizing Rest and Family** Prioritizing [[Health and Sleep | sleep]], training, and family time became essential. The understanding shifted from "living just to work" to working to "be able to live" [03:08:08, 03:09:59]. This includes setting aside time for children and taking vacations [03:36:00, 03:37:37].

This experience underscores that while professional dedication is important, self-care and recognizing physiological needs like [[Health and Sleep | sleep]] are paramount for long-term well-being and sustained performance [00:37:20, 00:39:48, 01:40:06].

The discussion on secularism and religious truth centers on the nature of truth itself, its origin, and its implications for modern society and individual choices. Frei Gilson asserts that the **Catholic Church** defends a singular, absolute truth, which is fundamental to its teachings and understanding of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>.

## The Origin and Authority of Truth
According to Frei Gilson, the ultimate source of truth is God, as revealed in the [[Religious Texts and Interpretations | Bible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. The Bible's authorship is divine, not human; for instance, the tablets given to Moses were "written with the finger of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. God commanded that things be written down "so that you never again forget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, emphasizing the importance of a written record for divine communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. Therefore, the Bible is not merely the "word of men" but "the word of God that acts effectively" in believers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. This divine authorship means that its teachings are eternal and unchangeable by human opinion, including that of priests or even the Pope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:05">[02:58:05]</a>.

The concept of truth is personified in [[The Role and Nature of Religion | Jesus Christ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>. [[The Role and Nature of Religion | Jesus Christ]] explicitly states, "I am the path, the truth and the life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>. He was born "to bear witness to the Truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:19">[01:40:19]</a>, and those who are "of the Truth" will hear his voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:31">[01:40:31]</a>. Denying this truth leads to a state of [[views_on_secular_influences_and_religious_practices | lies]], akin to the devil who "did not remain in the truth because the truth is not in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>.

## Secularism and the Challenge to Religious Truth
The debate arises when secular perspectives challenge the Church's defined truths. Frei Gilson observes a "spiritual and moral calamity" in modern society where "evil they call good and good evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>. This societal trend, where what is evil is presented as good and vice versa, is seen as a sign of decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. The Church, therefore, cannot compromise on its truths, even if it means clashing with prevailing ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:38">[01:33:38]</a>.

### Examples of Conflict
*   **Abortion:** The Church's defense of life in the womb is presented as a defense of "scientific, real, factual" truth: a child exists within the mother's belly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>.
*   **Gender Identity:** The analogy of a "yellow cup" is used to illustrate how society attempts to deny an obvious truth (the cup is yellow) by imposing an ideology (claiming the cup is red) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:49">[01:35:49]</a>. This applies to discussions around sex and gender, where the Church adheres to a biological truth while acknowledging respect for individual choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:35">[01:54:35]</a>.
*   **Marriage:** The Church upholds the biblical teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman, and remarriage is not permitted while the first spouse lives, based on Jesus's direct teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:45">[02:58:45]</a>. This is seen as an unchangeable truth, not subject to human opinion or societal trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## The Role of the Church in a Secular World
The Church's role is to proclaim the truth without imposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>. While the state is secular, this does not mean that religious figures cannot speak about their faith or propose its "good news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. Freedom of expression is vital for evangelization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>. The Church sees an increasing trend of state interference within religious institutions, dictating what can or cannot be said, which is perceived as dangerous to this freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>.

## Impact on Individuals and Society
The loss of the "sense of Truth" has led humanity to be "disoriented" and "lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>. This can manifest in parents not knowing how to teach right from wrong to their children, blaming external institutions instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:49">[01:31:49]</a>.

Despite societal pressures and the "seducer of the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a> (the devil) attempting to paint evil as good, individuals retain [[role_of_faith_and_rationality_in_understanding_belief | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:56">[03:09:56]</a>. God has a plan for each person â€” to be "holy and blameless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:28">[03:10:28]</a>, which translates to happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:08">[03:11:08]</a>. Sin, defined as an act against truth, cannot bring lasting happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:20">[02:02:20]</a>. Salvation is offered to all who genuinely believe in [[The Role and Nature of Religion | Jesus Christ]] and adhere to his teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>. The journey to holiness is personal, but it requires renouncing sin and embracing Christ's virtues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

Even in moments of doubt or God's perceived silence, it is an opportunity for [[role_of_faith_and_rationality_in_understanding_belief | faith]] to deepen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:41">[02:48:41]</a>. The call is to continue seeking God, as his silence can be a form of communication or a preparation for deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:26">[02:50:26]</a>.

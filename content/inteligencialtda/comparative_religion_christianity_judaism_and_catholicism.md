This article explores the commonalities, differences, and spirit of [[interfaith_dialogue_among_a_rabbi_priest_and_pastor | interfaith dialogue]] between Judaism, Catholicism, and [[christian_denominations_and_their_differences | Protestantism]], based on a conversation featuring a Rabbi, a priest, and a pastor. The discussion highlights theological points, historical context, and the importance of respect and understanding across religious traditions.

## The Spirit of Dialogue
The podcast gathering a Rabbi, a priest, and a pastor is described as a "historic night" aimed at expanding knowledge and exploring common and unusual aspects of their respective religions [00:00:17]. This [[interfaith_dialogue_among_a_rabbi_priest_and_pastor | interfaith dialogue]] is distinguished from "ecumenism," which is a more official movement by the [[role_of_the_catholic_church_in_historical_christianity | Catholic Church]] to unite churches officially [01:11:32]. The dialogue emphasizes the importance of listening, mutual respect, and finding unity despite doctrinal differences [01:11:46], [01:16:16], [01:42:52].

> [!quote] Pope Francis and Rabbi Abraham Skorka
> A significant example of [[interfaith_dialogue_among_a_rabbi_priest_and_pastor | interfaith dialogue]] is recounted: after an attack on a synagogue in Buenos Aires, then-Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis) approached Rabbi Abraham Skorka not just to pray, but to ask how they could help rebuild. This led to multiple public debates between them, recorded and released in a book titled "Between Heaven and Earth," demonstrating how intelligent dialogue can find confluence and create unity and communion [02:05:05].

## The Concept of God and Faith
All three traditions at the table agree that they worship the same God [01:47:05]. This God is seen as the creator of the universe, making all human beings brothers [01:03:00].

### Jewish Perspective on God and Faith
In the Jewish view, there is one God who is omnipotent and an infinite light [01:47:47]. Faith is understood as experiencing God even when one doesn't fully comprehend Him, especially during difficult times [01:48:10]. Judaism emphasizes [[religious_beliefs_and_atheism | knowledge]] as central to developing love for God, as written in the Torah [01:54:10]. The name of God is handled with deep respect, often referred to as "axemi" to avoid pronouncing the sacred name in vain [03:28:49].

> [!quote] The essence of the name "Judah"
> The essence of the name Judah is "gratitude" [05:01:21]. This reflects the Jewish practice of constant thanksgiving, reinforcing their connection to the Creator [05:01:27].

### Christian Perspective on God and Faith
[[influence_of_christianity | Christianity]], particularly Catholicism, emphasizes God's presence, stating that God is "with us" or "in our midst" [04:55:04]. This idea of God's loving presence becomes radicalized in the Christian belief of the Word becoming flesh in Jesus [05:08:29]. The [[the_concept_and_role_of_catholic_rituals_and_practices | Catholic concept of Sacrament]] is also defined as presence or mystery [05:13:30].

[[catholic_beliefs_and_practices | Catholic theology]] includes the concept of the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) [05:17:34]. This multiplicity within unity is seen as fundamental, reflecting God's communal nature [05:28:20].

### Types of Faith
The discussion differentiates between two types of faith:
*   **Doctrinal Faith (Fides Quae)**: This refers to beliefs or doctrines (e.g., fasting on Yom Kippur, the Holy Sacrament, Jesus' return, keeping the Sabbath) [02:51:51], [02:57:51]. This is the "cerebral" aspect of faith [02:57:51].
*   **Relational Faith (Fides Qua)**: This is a personal relationship with the Creator. Doctrinal beliefs only gain meaning if they are rooted in this personal relationship [03:07:34].

An "intelligent faith" is promoted, contrasting with fundamentalism which lacks such intelligence [03:19:12]. Intelligent faith involves being open to reading "inside" and understanding the deeper meaning, rather than adhering to rigid, surface-level interpretations [03:19:45].

## Sacred Texts and Practices
The Torah is described as the foundation of Judaism, with its customs originating from the Jewish people's dispersion and adaptation over centuries [04:59:10]. The Christian Bible, including the Old and New Testaments, is seen as proving biblical episodes through archaeology [08:08:43].

### The Sabbath
The observance of the Sabbath (Shabbat) is a point of distinction. For Jews and Adventists, the Sabbath is kept on Saturday, beginning Friday evening [03:54:19], [04:00:20]. For Catholics, Sunday is the day of worship, though the liturgical day for Catholics also begins the evening before [04:08:33], [04:10:04]. The speaker notes that despite these differences, the Father, Pastor, and Rabbi can "meet on Saturday which is Sunday and Sunday which is Saturday" in a poetic sense at sunset [04:15:37].

### The Virgin Mary
The discussion touches upon the virginity of Mary, a point of contention between some [[christian_denominations_and_their_differences | Christian denominations]]. An Adventist pastor defends the Catholic dogma of Mary remaining virgin during childbirth, explaining it through the literal reading of the Bible that connects Mary as the "new Eve" [07:30:29].

### The Figure of Jesus
For [[influence_of_christianity | Christians]], Jesus is the Messiah who died on the cross for salvation, and His return is eagerly awaited [02:59:22], [03:02:52]. For Judaism, Jesus is not considered the Messiah but rather a "brother," a wise man, or a prophet, and the concept of him being God is viewed as heresy [02:58:05], [03:08:29]. The Jewish tradition awaits the coming of their Messiah (Mashiach), who will be a wise descendant of King David, rebuild the Third Temple, and bring world peace [03:07:37], [03:12:35].

## Salvation and Works
A key theological difference is the understanding of salvation:
*   **Jewish View (Meritorious):** Salvation is acquired through works and adherence to the Torah/Law. The divine characteristics within human beings allow them to acquire merit through their own actions and gifts [05:20:47], [05:27:31].
*   **Christian View (Pauline):** Salvation is not meritorious; it comes through the death of Christ on the cross [05:30:40]. Works are seen not as a means to salvation, but as a result of it [05:40:53].

## Historical Context and Coexistence
The historical context of the [[role_of_the_catholic_church_in_historical_christianity | Catholic Church]] and its relationship with other groups is mentioned, including the Spanish Inquisition and [[protestantism_and_its_relationship_with_jewish_communities | Luther's anti-Semitism]] [05:26:45]. However, stories of individuals and institutions protecting Jews during the Holocaust (e.g., priests, pastors, Jewish leaders like Dom Isaac Abravanel) demonstrate moments of solidarity and heroism across faiths [05:49:50].

## The Purpose of Life and Happiness
All speakers agree that life has a purpose â€“ to connect with the Creator and to love God's creatures [06:44:20]. Happiness is not found in material possessions but is an "emotional state," a "state of mind" [01:15:09]. This profound longing for "paradise" or a return to a state of spiritual rest is shared across traditions, highlighting a universal human desire for meaning and connection beyond the mundane [01:13:51], [01:16:12], [01:17:10].

## The Role of Archaeology and Science
Biblical archaeology serves to prove the historical accuracy of biblical episodes [02:08:35]. The museum director recounts the discovery of a brick from Babylon with Nebuchadnezzar's inscription, serving as a tangible link to the biblical account of Daniel and the Babylonian captivity [02:14:15]. This demonstrates how science (archaeology) can explore the "infinite wisdom of God" [02:27:07]. The discussion also mentions figures like Isaac Newton, who spent a significant portion of his studies on theology, showing that science and religion are not necessarily in conflict [03:19:50].

## The Importance of Religious Education
The need for religious education in schools is discussed as a way to improve conflicts by fostering religious sensitivity and understanding [03:21:00]. It aims to draw people out of narcissism and promote solidarity by recognizing shared human experiences and values [03:22:44]. The goal is not to generalize religious groups as perfect, but to understand and respect individual convictions and experiences, fostering love for God and for one's neighbor [03:25:00], [03:26:03], [03:27:04].

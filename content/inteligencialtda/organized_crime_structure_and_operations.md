Frank, a former member of the PCC (Primeiro Comando da Capital) from 2016 to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, aims to expose the realities of [[organized_crime_structure_and_operations | organized crime]] to prevent young people from joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. He emphasizes that his work highlights the path of justice and the police, not the criminal underworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Due to life threats, he cannot appear in person and constantly changes locations, traveling through South American countries like Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina, never staying in one house for more than a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. He relies on the support of his followers and God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Exiting Organized Crime
Exiting the PCC is not straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Members are obligated to uphold their commitment and follow all directives once baptized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Frank himself sought to leave to focus on work and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. The process involves submitting a request to the command to cease criminal activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. A "removed" status grants a 90-day rest period from all organizational interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Frank was "excluded and decreed" (marked for death) because he discussed an internal PCC maneuver that could not be proven, making him a target for any criminal in the State of São Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## PCC Structure and Hierarchy
The PCC operates with a highly [[organized_crime_structure_and_operations | organized]] and structured hierarchy, akin to a political party or a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

### Top Echelons
*   **Final Tune/High Tune/Command Dome:** This is the ultimate authority, comprising leaders like Marcola, Julinho Carambola, Barbará, Jackal, Forged, Tiriça, Andinho, and Abel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. They determine alliances with other factions, political parties, and overall strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Street Tune:** These members, including Cebola, Forged, and André of Rap, operate on the street and report directly to the Final Tune, ensuring orders from inside prisons are executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   **Summary (Resumo):** These individuals act as intermediaries, relaying "yes or no" decisions from the tunes to lower levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Direct communication with the "tune" is restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Summary Support (Apoio do Resumo):** Supports the Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

### Regional and Local Levels
*   **General of Inter (Geral do Inter):** Responsible for specific DDD (area code) regions, such as 011 for São Paulo or 013 for Baixada Santista <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   **General City (Geral Cidade):** Each city has its own general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Discipline:** A baptized PCC member responsible for all occurrences within a specific peripheral neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **FM (Family Member):** The lowest position, responsible for the PCC's "mouths of smoke" (drug dens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:56">[02:19:56]</a>.

## PCC Operations and Practices
### Recruitment and Baptism
To join the PCC, an individual must be invited, not ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. The process requires two godparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. One godfather must know the recruit for at least four years, while the other can be a recent acquaintance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. New members are expected to grow within the faction and "make a difference," not just "be one more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. They must read the PCC statute, which contains 17 items and 43 points outlining rules and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. The statute prioritizes God, then the PCC, and then family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. It forbids acts like "talaricagem" (stealing someone's wife), "rati" (stealing within the community), and "snitching" (informing on crime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

### Financial Contributions and Money Laundering
Members are historically required to pay a monthly fee, which for Frank was R$930, plus an additional R$430 for "strengthening" (visits, prisoner transportation, legal costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. This system also involved raffles where members were forced to sell numbers for prizes like rifles, drugs, cars, or even drug dens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Recently, the PCC announced it no longer needed to collect money due to having achieved its financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. However, a new "Progress sector" now obliges members to withdraw and sell 1 kg of cocaine (worth R$12,000), effectively a pyramid scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.

The PCC uses various methods for [[money_laundering_and_organized_crime_involvement | money laundering]], including:
*   **Online Games:** Games like "Tiger Tiger" are used for money laundering, with platforms having involvement from PCC members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:26">[02:54:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:41">[02:54:41]</a>.
*   **Influencers and Artists:** Influencers and artists, including funk singers, are sponsored by the PCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:58">[02:54:58]</a>. They promote games or make money laundering propaganda in exchange for funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:16">[02:55:16]</a>.
*   **Businesses:** The PCC is involved in public transport companies, healthcare (hospitals in Baixada Santista), cleaning companies, football teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:55">[02:28:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:57">[02:28:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:08">[02:29:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:23">[02:29:23]</a>. They also control "Cracolândia" (Crackland) in São Paulo, a mobile crack house registered with the PCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Sector:** The PCC has a dedicated "real estate sector" responsible for buying and selling faction properties, including My House My Life apartments that are bought cheaply from residents and then resold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:36">[02:09:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:42">[02:09:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:09">[02:10:09]</a>.

### Justice and Enforcement within the PCC
The PCC maintains its own "crime court" or "board" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:15">[02:21:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:18">[02:21:18]</a>. This system involves:
*   **Accusations and Defense:** Accused and accuser present evidence, and "disciplines" act as judges/prosecutors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>.
*   **Punishments:** Punishments vary. Theft within the community typically results in severe beatings, but only from the neck down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:10">[02:21:10]</a>. More severe offenses, like violating a rule or "snitching," can lead to a "request for life" (death sentence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:26">[02:21:26]</a>.
*   **Cruelty:** The PCC is described as cruel, with punishments ranging from breaking limbs to brutal killings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:04">[03:13:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:18">[03:18:18]</a>. Rivals may be tortured (e.g., fingers, ears, nose cut off and made to eat them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:18">[03:11:18]</a>.
*   **Control over Communities:** The PCC exerts total control over favela communities in São Paulo, dictating daily life, including when parties can be held, traffic rules, and even personal disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:04">[02:24:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:10">[02:24:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a>. They present themselves as a force for community good, offering basic food baskets, organizing parties, and donating medicine, creating a false image that turns the population against the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:02">[02:25:02]</a>.

### Prison System Control
The PCC dominates prisons in the State of São Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Upon entering a CDP (Provisional Detention Center), new prisoners are interrogated about their affiliations and any debts or issues with crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Prisoners must follow the PCC's rules regardless of membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. They categorize prisoners into "sectors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:16">[03:51:16]</a>.

*   **Sector System:** Faction leaders reside in "sector cells" and control other prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:01">[03:56:01]</a>. Prison directors often communicate only with these sector leaders to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:15">[03:56:15]</a>.
*   **Methods of Death:** Prisoners facing execution by the PCC are given choices on how to die: knife, hanging, or "Gatorade" (instant overdose from cocaine mixed in water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:58">[04:06:58]</a>.
*   **Money in Prison:** Prisoners often claim to need money for "rent" inside jail cells to get money from family, but this is a lie; the money is for drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:35">[03:55:35]</a>. Drugs like marijuana and crack enter easily into prisons and are sold at inflated prices, allowing some prisoners to get rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:34">[03:58:34]</a>.
*   **Crack Use:** While the PCC sells crack, it does not permit its members to use it, considering it a "drug of no future" that leads to unreliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:01">[04:19:01]</a>. Members caught using crack are excluded and may face death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:14">[04:19:14]</a>.

### Drug Trafficking and Ports
The PCC engages in extensive [[drug_trafficking_and_challenges_in_policing | drug trafficking]]. Cocaine primarily comes from Baixada Santista (mostly through the port of Santos), with Peruvian powder considered the strongest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:30">[04:16:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:47">[04:22:47]</a>. Marijuana comes from Paraguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:08">[04:30:08]</a>. The port of Santos is a vital hub for all PCC operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:01">[03:15:01]</a>. Professional divers are used to attach cocaine kilos to ship hulls bound for Europe, particularly Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:34">[03:13:34]</a>.

### Political Infiltration and Alliances
The PCC actively infiltrates politics, with members holding positions such as councilors and even mayor candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:23">[02:52:23]</a>. They have financial sectors that support candidates and lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>. There are reports of PCC directives for members to vote for specific candidates, such as Lula in the recent presidential election, and against Bolsonaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:52">[02:53:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:12">[02:54:12]</a>. The PCC has no discrimination against any religion; they integrate with politicians, Candomblécists, Catholics, and even evangelical churches that may hide drugs for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:50">[02:38:50]</a>. However, they discriminate against homosexuals, prohibiting them from joining and punishing members caught in homosexual acts with death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:01">[02:39:01]</a>.

### Rivalry with Comando Vermelho (CV)
The PCC and CV are major rival factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>. Their rivalry intensified after the death of "Rafat," a border kingpin, with each accusing the other of a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:16">[02:15:16]</a>. The PCC allied with TCP (Terceiro Comando Puro) in Rio de Janeiro, while CV allied with other state factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:33">[02:16:33]</a>. The CV has gained significant ground in Northeastern states, where PCC strength has waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:41">[02:17:41]</a>.

#### Key Differences:
*   **Minor Recruitment:** PCC baptizes minors from 16 years old in Northeastern states, a practice that did not exist previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>. CV baptizes as young as 11-12 years old, based on the ability to pull a trigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:22">[02:19:22]</a>.
*   **Treatment of Families:** If a PCC member errs and flees, the PCC typically does not target their family, believing the issue is with the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:11">[02:20:11]</a>. CV, however, targets entire families, including children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:51">[02:19:51]</a>.
*   **Investment Strategy:** PCC gives new members a "name" and leverages their reputation for credit and favors within the criminal world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:56">[02:26:56]</a>. CV, on the other hand, financially invests in its "soldiers" by providing weapons and drugs (e.g., 1 kg of crack) for them to sell, leading to faster integration and expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:40">[02:26:40]</a>.
*   **Structure vs. War:** PCC aims for [[political_involvement_of_criminal_organizations | political infiltration]] and uses alliances and agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:21">[02:45:21]</a>. CV is more focused on direct warfare and guerrilla tactics, invading territories and killing rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:55">[02:45:55]</a>.
*   **Leadership:** Marcola, often perceived as the sole leader of the PCC, is not the "number one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>. The PCC has always been governed by a "tune" — a group of members who collectively analyze issues and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>. André do Rap is currently very influential, responsible for the port of Santos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>.

## Critiques and Solutions
Frank emphasizes that Brazil is largely controlled by [[organized_crime_structure_and_operations | organized crime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>. He advocates for:
*   **"Leather and Work" for Prisoners:** Prisoners should be forced to work and face suffering in jail, rather than receiving privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. This contrasts with the current system that provides comfort and allows some to profit from drug sales inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>.
*   **De-romanticization of Crime:** Media, music, and influencers should stop glorifying criminals and [[media_representation_of_criminals | organized crime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:50">[03:09:50]</a>. They should portray crime as shameful and wrong, aligning with reality rather than fictional narratives like the "Sintonia" series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:09">[03:13:09]</a>.
*   **Increased Police Autonomy:** Police need more resources and autonomy to operate in favelas, which are often controlled by criminals due to lack of state presence and logistical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:08">[02:40:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:59">[03:00:59]</a>.
*   **Addressing Social Issues:** Humanization efforts should focus on communities, providing proper housing instead of shacks, and improving access for law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:05">[02:01:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:30">[02:01:30]</a>.

Frank notes a lack of support for ex-criminals seeking to leave the lifestyle. He claims no politicians or organizations have helped him, despite his efforts to expose crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>. He believes his survival is due to God's will and his constant evasive measures, not any external support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:05">[03:11:05]</a>.

[[Marcos Chiesas career in Brazilian radio and television | Marcos Chiesa]], also known as Bolinha, shared numerous anecdotes and insights into the behind-the-scenes workings of the popular Brazilian humor program, [[pnico_na_tv_and_its_cultural_impact | Pânico na TV]]. From its humble beginnings in radio to its transition to television and the challenges faced, the journey was marked by improvisation, tight budgets, and daring stunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Radio Origins and Early Days

Bolinha's career in radio began somewhat unintentionally. He started at Transamérica in promotion, initially earning no salary for a year, simply helping out friends during college vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. His tasks involved distributing stickers and prizes, which helped him connect with the radio environment and its audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:08">[02:31:08]</a>. After a year, he was hired and spent 12 years at Transamérica before moving to Rádio Cidade and then Jovem Pan, always in promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a>.

The radio version of Pânico, called "Pânico na Rádio," began with Emílio Batista and Billy, with Bolinha joining later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:16">[02:54:16]</a>. The show encouraged direct interaction with the public, often asking for opinions on controversial topics like the legalization of marijuana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:09">[02:15:09]</a>. This format of interviewing people on the street and engaging with listeners by phone became a hallmark of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Transition to Television

The idea to bring Pânico to television arose from the show's success on radio. Initially, cameras were installed in the radio studio to broadcast live, allowing audiences to "watch" the radio program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This marked the very beginning of the show's visual presence.

### Budgetary Constraints and Creative Solutions
In its infancy, Pânico na TV operated on an extremely tight budget. For the first year, no one earned a salary, and the team had to personally cover expenses like tolls and gasoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. The show's then-director, Ricardo de Barros, even bought the first camera out of his own pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This forced creativity and improvisation, leading to many iconic segments.

## Iconic Segments and Stunts

Pânico na TV became known for its daring, often absurd, and physically demanding segments.

### "Five Ways"
One of the most famous segments was "Five Ways" (Cinco Maneiras). These involved performing various tasks or pranks in different, increasingly ridiculous ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Examples included:
*   **Waxing:** A segment that involved a waxing demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.
*   **Birthday Gifts:** Five different ways to give a birthday gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>.
*   **Tattoos:** Bolinha famously got tattoos on his head as part of a segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. This personal sacrifice highlighted the team's commitment to the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.

### "Pânico Delivery"
This segment involved picking up drunk individuals from clubs and taking them home, while ensuring they didn't drive under the influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. The challenge was making sure the person didn't vomit in the car or on the "Panicats" (female assistants who accompanied the delivery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>. This segment also included humorous interactions, like the "Pânico Bath," where the person would shower in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.

### Physically Demanding Stunts
The show's stunts often carried significant physical risks. Bolinha recounted several instances:
*   **Burning Coffin:** He was placed in a coffin that was then set on fire. Despite assurances of safety, smoke entered the coffin, and he struggled to breathe and scream the emergency word "parallelepiped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>. He nearly died during this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.
*   **Ant Hill:** He sat on an ant hill, resulting in painful stings across his buttocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>.
*   **Bee Sting:** He had a bee sting his mouth, causing severe swelling that prevented him from recording the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18">[01:33:18]</a>.
*   **Paintball:** He was shot in the forehead with a paintball gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.
*   **Roller Coaster:** A stunt involving a car rolling over, with him inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a>.
*   **Ostrich Race:** [[Raquel Pachecos life story and experiences | Sabrina Sato]] fell off an ostrich during a race, requiring an ambulance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Public and Internal Pressure
The show's humor sometimes drew criticism. Ricardo de Barros, the director, received calls from Bolinha's father, concerned about the extreme nature of the stunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>. The team also faced pressure to maintain audience ratings (IBOPE), which dictated the type of content they produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. If ratings dipped, the team felt immense stress to create something even more impactful for the next week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.

### Humor Evolution and Media Landscape
Pânico na TV emerged during a period where humor was more unrestrained. The show broke away from traditional, "half-same" humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>, taking celebrities off their pedestals and interacting with them in unconventional ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:53">[01:56:53]</a>. However, over time, societal standards shifted, leading to a greater scrutiny of content and less tolerance for certain types of jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. The team often had to adapt and self-censor to avoid backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>.

## Production Logistics

The production process was rigorous, with constant pressure to deliver new and engaging content. Meetings were held early in the week to plan segments, with continuous recording throughout the week to prepare for the Sunday broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a>. The team often worked long hours, with recording sessions sometimes lasting 15 hours or bleeding into the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a>.

Travel was a significant part of the show, with segments filmed across Brazil and internationally. Bolinha recounted filming in Amsterdam, Bolivia (including the "Death Road"), and various locations in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:33">[02:33:33]</a>. These trips often involved experiencing unique cultural aspects and engaging in challenging activities, such as driving different vehicles in foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.

## Team Dynamics and Departures

The Pânico team was initially characterized by strong camaraderie, feeling like a close-knit group where everyone wanted to be part of the "joke class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>. Key figures like Ceará and [[Raquel Pachecos life story and experiences | Sabrina Sato]] joined the team, contributing significantly to its composition and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

However, as the show progressed and gained massive popularity, individual egos and financial dynamics began to play a role. Departures of core members, like Sabrina Sato and Ceará, brought a "bad atmosphere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:08">[01:53:08]</a>. While the initial sense of camaraderie was strong, the pressure and financial success eventually led to changes in relationships and individual priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:21">[02:09:21]</a>.

## Legacy and Reflection

Bolinha reflects on his time at Pânico na TV as a "historical" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>. The show's success, at times even surpassing major networks like Globo in ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, was a testament to its unique approach to humor and direct engagement with the public. It revolutionized Brazilian television comedy by breaking traditional norms and bringing a raw, often unpredictable energy to the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:40">[01:56:40]</a>. Despite the physical demands and the occasional controversies, the experience was profoundly impactful on his career and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:19">[02:46:19]</a>.

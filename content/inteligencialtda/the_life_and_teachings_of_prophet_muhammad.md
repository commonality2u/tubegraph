## Introduction
Prophet Muhammad (also spelled Mohamed) is a central figure in [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islamic beliefs]] and is regarded as the last prophet sent by God to guide humanity [01:13:11]. The word "Muhammad" originates from the Arabic word "Ramada," meaning "praised" or "the one who is praised" [02:50:06].

## Early Life and Prophecy
Prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca, in the region then known as the Arabian Peninsula (today's Saudi Arabia), around 570 CE [02:25:26]. Until the age of 40, he lived as an ordinary person, working as a merchant [02:42:07]. He was known for his trustworthiness, earning nicknames like "the honest one" and "the trustworthy one" [00:08:15]. People would entrust him with their valuables, like gold, because they knew he would not betray their trust [00:58:31].

He worked for a businesswoman, a widow 15 years his senior, with whom he later married and had six children â€“ two boys who died as newborns, and four girls who grew to adulthood [02:48:48].

### The First Revelation
At 40 years old, Muhammad began to perform spiritual retreats because he disagreed with the prevailing polytheism in Mecca [02:37:40]. The original inhabitants of Mecca were monotheistic, following Abrahamic traditions, but polytheism had been introduced by a merchant who brought images from trade trips to Damascus and Syria, influenced by Indian culture [02:57:40]. This led to each tribe having its own idol, which the wealthy merchants used as a form of social control to manipulate people's faith and maintain commercial power [02:59:15].

During one of his retreats, God sent the Angel Gabriel to Muhammad in his real angelic appearance [03:00:00]. Gabriel commanded him to "read" [03:10:59]. Muhammad, being illiterate, replied that he did not know how [03:14:00]. The first verse of the Quran then revealed: "Read in the name of your creator" [03:22:04]. This marked the beginning of his prophecy, emphasizing knowledge as the first step to reach God and the pinnacle of faith [03:12:00].

## The Quran: A Code of Life
The Quran, for Muslims, is not just a book to be read but a code of life [04:40:40]. The word "Quran" itself means "what heals" or "the book that is read" [01:09:50]. Its revelation spanned 23 years, from when Prophet Muhammad was 40 until his passing at 63 [01:11:58]. The Quran was revealed gradually, responding to specific situations, providing guidance on "do this, don't do this" [03:57:00].

The Quran addresses three main themes:
1.  **History of Previous Peoples**: It recounts the stories of successful and unsuccessful nations (e.g., Pharaoh, Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham, Lot, the flood) to teach lessons and avoid repeating past mistakes [04:51:00].
2.  **Faith and Belief in God**: It advocates strict [[philosophy_and_theological_interpretations | monotheism]], emphasizing the worship of one God, the Creator, Sustainer, and Eternal, who has no beginning or end [04:59:00].
3.  **Laws and Rules**: It provides general rules for all aspects of life, including political, economic, educational, family, and social systems [04:56:00]. These rules are seen as immutable and timeless, designed for human well-being and happiness [02:42:07].

### Role of Prophets and Divine Revelation
Prophets, including Muhammad, Jesus, Moses, Abraham, and David, are considered teachers sent by God to facilitate understanding of the sacred scriptures [04:22:00]. They demonstrate in practice how these scriptures should be lived [04:25:00]. The [[revelations_and_spiritual_insights_about_jesus_and_his_hidden_years | divine revelation]] comes through the Angel Gabriel [03:12:00]. The Prophet Muhammad did not know how to read or write, a fact highlighted as a miracle, as he compiled the Quran through inspiration and dictation to scribes [03:14:00].

## Islamic Teachings and Practices
### Monotheism and God's Oneness
A core [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islamic belief]] is the absolute oneness of God, who is the Creator of everything and everyone [04:33:00]. Muslims do not believe God has children, partners, a wife, father, or mother [05:41:00]. All prophets, including Jesus, Mary, Moses, and Adam, are considered creatures of God, not divine themselves [04:47:00]. God sent 124,000 prophets throughout human history [05:12:00].

### The Meaning of "Muslim" and "Islam"
The word "Muslim" means "one who surrenders totally and voluntarily to God the only one" [01:09:14]. "Islam" refers to the practice of this surrender [01:19:18]. For Muslims, religion is not separate from daily life; ethics, spirituality, and faith are integrated into every aspect [01:15:00]. A Muslim is expected to maintain the same values and character inside and outside the mosque, whether as a husband, wife, citizen, or worker [01:53:00]. This comprehensive approach means [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islamic religion]] has rules for business, physiological needs, and even personal hygiene [02:37:00].

### Core Practices
*   **Prayer (Salat)**: Muslims perform five daily prayers at specific times (e.g., dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, evening) [03:10:00]. These prayers involve specific movements and recitations in Arabic, aiming for spiritual elevation, self-control, and humility [03:15:00].
*   **Fasting (Sawm)**: During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn until sunset, abstaining from food and drink [01:47:00]. This practice fosters self-control, spiritual elevation, and empathy for the needy [01:47:00]. The Islamic calendar is lunar, causing Ramadan to shift through all seasons over time [01:48:00].
*   **Charity (Zakat)**: Zakat is an annual payment of 2.5% of net profit made by the wealthy to the poor [01:16:00]. This obligatory charity is meant to be given directly to the needy, particularly close family and neighbors, fostering social responsibility and inclusion [01:18:00].
*   **Prohibitions**:
    *   **Pork and Alcohol**: Both are strictly forbidden, considered harmful to health and leading to social problems [02:49:00]. This prohibition extends to derivatives, consumption, sale, transport, and even apology for these substances [02:54:00].
    *   **Immodest Clothing**: Both men and women are forbidden from wearing tight or transparent clothing that defines the body [03:07:00]. Men must cover from the navel to the knee, while women cover their entire body except for the face and hands [03:10:00]. This is for the preservation of family, fidelity, and to prevent covetousness or temptation [03:32:00].

### Marriage and Family
[[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islamic religion]] encourages marriage based on conviction and shared values, not just physical attraction [02:00:00]. Arranged marriages are not encouraged, as both men and women have the freedom to marry whom they wish, provided there is a minimum convergence of values and ethics [02:00:00]. Physical contact before the marriage contract is forbidden, emphasizing rational assessment of character and family values over fleeting emotions [02:09:00].

The Quran outlines specific roles within a family: the husband is primarily the protector and financial provider, while the wife's main duty is that of an educator, being the foundation of society and family [01:54:00]. These roles can be flexibly exchanged by mutual agreement of the couple [01:55:00]. Divorce is permitted under rules that ensure no party is harmed [02:17:00].

## Prophet Muhammad's Legacy and Islamic History
The migration of Prophet Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina, known as the Hijra, marks "year zero" of the [[islamic_history_and_cultural_influence | Islamic calendar]] [01:00:00]. In Mecca, Muslims were persecuted, but in Medina, they were accepted and established an [[islamic_history_and_cultural_influence | Islamic government]], transforming from a persecuted group to an organized community with institutions and an army [01:01:00]. This migration was a pivotal moment, leading to the expansion of [[islamic_history_and_cultural_influence | Islam]] to various Arab tribes and empires [01:01:00].

### Relation to other Prophets
Prophet Muhammad's teachings align with those of earlier prophets, all sharing the mission to guide humanity to worship one God [05:51:00]. In [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]], it is believed that God sent 124,000 prophets, with some being more widely known than others [05:12:00].

*   **Jesus**: The Quran mentions Jesus more than Prophet Muhammad [05:43:00]. Muslims believe Jesus was born miraculously through the Angel Gabriel and ascended to heaven in body and soul at 33, not dying on the cross [05:46:00]. They believe he will return as a sign of the end times, reigning and establishing justice before a natural death [05:10:00]. However, Muslims do not consider Jesus to be God, but rather a messenger [05:31:00].
*   **Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Adam**: These figures are all recognized as prophets and messengers of God, with their revelations forming part of the continuous divine guidance for humanity [05:47:00].

### Addressing Misconceptions
The transcript addresses common misconceptions about [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]]:
*   **Gender Equality**: The Quran states that all human beings are created male and female, and everyone is equal before God [05:00:00]. Differences in religious obligations (e.g., women's exemption from prayer during menstruation) account for natural variations, not spiritual superiority [05:17:00].
*   **Terrorism**: Terrorism is viewed as a separate group of fanatics that exists across all religions and ideologies (Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, atheist) [03:00:00]. These individuals commit atrocities based on their own choices and ideologies, often misattributing their actions to religion for justification [03:01:00]. The media, at times, directly associates terrorism with [[islamic_practices_and_beliefs | Islam]] for marketing or to create division [03:02:00].
*   **Sunni vs. Shiite**: These are historical political divisions within [[islamic_history_and_cultural_influence | Islam]] that emerged from disputes over the succession of the Prophet Muhammad [02:56:00]. Sunnis, comprising about 85% of Muslims, believe leadership should be based on aptitude and knowledge, while Shiites generally believe it should be hereditary within the Prophet's family [02:57:00]. These are considered divergences that, ideally, should be handled with dialogue and respect, without leading to offense or disrespect [02:59:00].

### Life After Death
Muslims believe in a continuation of life after death, not as reincarnation, but as a journey through different phases [03:54:00]. The soul, being the breath of God, is eternal and never dies [03:58:00]. After a phase in the "world of Souls," all people will be resurrected, and their bodies and souls will reunite for the Final Judgment [03:59:00]. Those who lived with faith in one God and whose good deeds outweigh their bad ones will enter an eternal paradise, which is real and physical [04:16:00]. There are also those who will temporarily or eternally reside in hellfire, also considered real and physical [04:17:00]. Paradise is described as a place of reward where individuals receive whatever they wish [04:38:00].

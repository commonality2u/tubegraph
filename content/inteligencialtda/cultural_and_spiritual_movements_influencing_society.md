## Introduction
The program "Limited Intelligence" explores various topics, including the profound influence of [[influence_of_spirituality_and_faith | spirituality]] and faith on society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This article delves into how different cultural and spiritual movements have shaped human history and continue to impact the present world.

## Eschatological Perspectives on Global Conflicts
An in-depth analysis of current global events, particularly the war in Israel, suggests a rapid acceleration of prophetic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. From an eschatological viewpoint, the conflict involving Israel is alarming because a predicted Third World War between Israel and Arab nations is seen as a precursor to the establishment of an antichrist government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

An ex-Satanist named Doc Marx, author of "The Secret of the Illuminati," claims to have revelations about a centuries-long project to establish a new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This project, allegedly shared by figures like Albert Pike (a "pope of Freemasonry"), aims for a single global government, currency, and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. It is believed that three world wars are necessary for this new order to be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### The Role of World Wars in Establishing a New Order
The theory, originating from Doc Marx's revelations, posits that world wars serve to establish a "synthesis" from "thesis" and "antithesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **First World War**: Aimed to overthrow the Russian Tsarist government, which opposed a Central Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This led to the establishment of a militarist, atheist, and communist nation, Russia, with financial support from the global banking elite for figures like Lenin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Second World War**: Intended to strengthen Russia into a superpower capable of destroying other nations and religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This interpretation aligns with the severe persecution of all religions (Christian, Jewish, Orthodox) under the Soviet Union, where the state became the sole authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Cold War**: Represented the clash between capitalism (thesis) and communism (antithesis), creating a polarized world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. This polarization, characterized by pitting different groups against each other (proletarian vs. businessman, black vs. white, straight vs. gay, Arab vs. Jew), serves to distract people from a larger, overarching plan towards a new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Third World War**: Predicted to start between Jews and Arabs (specifically Islam and Muslims), leading to a global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. From the "chaos" of this war, a "superman" or leader, formed by these elites, would emerge to offer economic and social solutions, bringing peace and ushering in the new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.

## The Rise of Islam and its Societal Influence
Islam is currently the fastest-growing religion globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. While not all Muslims are radical, an estimated 15-20% are extremists, equating to approximately 320 million people worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:51">[02:32:51]</a>. Radical Islam aims for Islam to be the world's sole religion, viewing adherents of other faiths as "infidels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:10">[02:05:10]</a>. This fundamentalist ideology drives severe persecution of Christians and Jews, including church burnings in places like India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>.

A significant factor in Islam's growth and [[impact_of_societal_changes_on_values | cultural transformation]] in nations is the high fertility rate among Muslim women, particularly compared to declining birth rates in traditionally Christian European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>. This demographic shift is leading to the Islamization of traditionally Christian nations, transforming their cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### Historical Roots of Anti-Israel Radicalism
The radicalism against Israel stems from a theology created by the Islamic fundamentalist leader Alm Vard around 1000 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>. His "House of Islam" and "House of Sword" theory states that any land once ruled by Islam can never again be governed by non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>. As Jerusalem was conquered by Saudi Arabian Islamists in 638 AD and has been under Islamic rule for centuries, extremists consider Israel's existence on this land unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:57">[03:33:57]</a>. This deeply ingrained belief explains why extremist groups reject a two-state solution and seek the "extermination of Israel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:54">[03:54:54]</a>.

## The 1968 Revolution and Shifting Western Values
The year 1968 marked a pivotal [[cultural_and_intellectual_history | cultural and intellectual history]] turning point, initiating a "gradual degradation of morals" that transformed Western culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">[01:57:38]</a>. This revolution, considered a synchronized, global, and orchestrated movement, specifically by leftist ideologies, was designed to undermine Christian values and prepare for an anti-Christian new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

### Key Aspects of the Revolution:
*   **Protests and Counterculture**: Included protests against the Vietnam War and the "Prague Spring," which implemented a cultural socialist revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:17">[01:58:17]</a>.
*   **Influence of Thinkers**: The revolution was led by thinkers like Herbert Marcuse of the Frankfurt School, which aimed to destroy Western culture, capitalism, and the religious dimension of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>. Marcuse advocated for cultural revolution through art, cinema, and music, rather than armed conflict, recognizing that American proletarians would not rebel due to capitalist benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:32">[02:08:32]</a>.
*   **Drug Use**: Promoted by figures like Harvard professor Timothy Leary, who advocated for psychedelic drugs like LSD to "expand the mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This led to widespread drug use, contributing to societal decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:20">[02:04:20]</a>.
*   **Sexual Revolution**: Championed by psychologists who linked repression to conflict, promoting "free sex" and a degradation of sexual morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:19">[02:05:19]</a>.
*   **[[music_as_a_transformative_element_in_society | Music as a Transformative Element]]**:
    *   **Woodstock (1969)**: Represented this countercultural era, celebrating the "Age of Aquarius," a mystical shift from the "Age of Pisces" (symbolizing Christianity) to a new order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:38">[02:01:38]</a>.
    *   **The Beatles**: The most acclaimed band in popular [[music_and_spirituality | music and spirituality]] history, derived their name from the "Beat Generation" movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>. John Lennon, particularly, became an activist, and songs like "Imagine" are interpreted as describing the new world order, influencing the collective subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>.
    *   **Punk Movement**: Emerged in the 1970s, expressing pessimism, revolt, and hatred against bourgeois and capitalist values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:57">[02:16:57]</a>. Their songs, like Dead Kennedys' "Holiday in Cambodia" (referencing Pol Pot's communist atrocities) and Sex Pistols' anti-monarchy anthems, fostered hate against capitalism and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:30">[02:17:30]</a>. The punk symbol is a broken cross, signifying "peace and love without Christ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:55">[02:15:55]</a>.
    *   **Heavy Metal**: Introduced Satanism into mainstream culture through bands like AC/DC and Iron Maiden, bringing distant occult practices closer to young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:34">[02:21:34]</a>.

### Impact on Society and Family Values
The 1968 revolution and subsequent cultural shifts have led to a multiplication of "iniquity," defined as disrespect for law, order, and God, and a cooling of love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:12">[01:54:12]</a>. This is seen in increased divorce rates and societal cruelty, with children blaming parents for everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:47">[02:22:47]</a>.

Philosophers like Friedrich Engels, a close associate of Karl Marx, theorized that social inequality began with the family, which enslaved women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:51">[02:26:51]</a>. This idea, deeply embedded in leftist thought, advocates for the abolition of the family to achieve social equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>.

## Occultism, Illuminati, and Prophetic Programming
The concept of a new world order involves a "big reset" to destroy the current world and replace it with one where humanity worships Lucifer and forgets God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Ancient Luciferian Cults**: Evidence of Luciferian cults, predating the flood, is found in "prediluvian pyramids" with symbols like the "all-seeing eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:33">[02:37:33]</a>. These cults practice bloodshed and human sacrifice, considering blood as currency in the spiritual realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:28">[02:38:28]</a>. Abortion is viewed as a modern form of shedding innocent blood, strengthening this "Empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:10">[02:34:10]</a>.
*   **Sabateanism and Frankism**: These movements, founded by Kabbalist rabbis Sabatai Zevi (1626) and Jacob Frank (1770), openly declared the God of scriptures as evil and Lucifer as good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>. They taught that biblical commandments and morals were no longer mandatory, allowing all sins, including sexual relationships like incest and pedophilia, as a path to "Redemption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:10">[02:55:10]</a>.
*   **The Illuminati**: Founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776, the Illuminati are seen as direct descendants of these movements, believing Sabatai Zevi's soul transmigrated into the "13 families" who secretly control global systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:45">[02:56:45]</a>. This includes control over financial systems (linking to the Rothschild family, whose name means "red shield," similar to Esau/Edom's "red" association), media, education, and the entertainment industry (Hollywood) to shape global thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Predictive Programming**: The media is used to "advertise future events" through drawings, books, theater, cinema, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>. This "predictive programming" subtly convinces people of ideas like population reduction (e.g., Thanos in "Avengers") or future global conflicts (e.g., "The Simpsons" predictions), implying a hidden agenda by those "in command" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Spiritual Guidance and the Role of the Church
From a spiritual perspective, the current global events are seen as signs of the "end of times," urging people to reflect on their lives and return to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>. The Bible emphasizes the importance of prayer, especially for Jerusalem, covering both Arabs and Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:52">[02:02:52]</a>.

The Church is considered God's embassy on Earth, representing Jesus through its various ministries (Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, Teachers, Evangelists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:51">[03:02:51]</a>. These ministries were restored throughout history, from the Protestant Reformation (Pastor and Teacher) to the Azusa Street Revival (Prophetic and Apostolic), enabling the church to fulfill its mission of restoring humanity's relationship with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:22">[03:07:22]</a>.

### Achieving Inner Peace
Despite global chaos, personal happiness and peace are found not in material satisfaction but in a true relationship with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a>. This [[views_on_secular_influences_and_religious_practices | spiritual connection]] is essential for overcoming anxiety, depression, and the existential void experienced by many in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:32">[02:24:32]</a>. By acknowledging God as Creator and turning to Him through faith in Jesus, individuals can find forgiveness for sins and experience an abundant life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The simple act of prayer, confessing Jesus as Lord, can transform one's life, filling the "hole" that only divine presence can satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:39">[03:22:39]</a>.

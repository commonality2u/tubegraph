## What is Machine Learning?
[[artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning | Machine learning]] is a field within [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | artificial intelligence]] where machines learn from data and examples, rather than being explicitly programmed with rules for every decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This contrasts with "classic" [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | Artificial Intelligence]], where every smart decision is directly programmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Today, approximately 99% of what is commonly referred to as [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | artificial intelligence]] in the news and media is actually [[artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning | machine learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Instead of teaching the computer how to make a decision, we guide it in learning how to make complex decisions, much like humans learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. For instance, a child learns the difference between a cat and a dog by being shown examples, not by being given a set of explicit rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This approach is more effective because human "smart lessons" are often difficult to translate into explicit rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. By processing millions of images of cats and dogs, a machine can develop its own complex rules to identify them, just as humans do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

The learning process is continuous; machines learn and adapt more over time as they receive more data input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The algorithms are genuinely learning rules to differentiate between concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### Algorithm vs. Model
*   **Algorithm**: This refers to the raw architecture or programming instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. It's the set of rules for a specific objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.
*   **Model**: Once data is passed through the algorithm and it learns from it, it becomes a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. For example, ChatGPT is a model that has already learned from vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

### Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
There are various types of [[artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning | machine learning]] algorithms:
*   **Transformers**: An extremely complex algorithm, forming the basis of systems like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. It uses an "attention" phenomenon, focusing on keywords and transforming information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>.
*   **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn through punishments and rewards, similar to how a child learns by trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. This is used in social media algorithms to reinforce user engagement through novel content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. It also helps prevent AI from generating harmful content by restricting "free" algorithms through layers of ethical guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Born from the theory of games, these involve two [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | AIs]] fighting each other: one generates a product (image, audio, text), and the other tries to determine if it's real or fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. This process trains the generator to deceive the discriminator, leading to increasingly realistic outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. This concept, developed in 2014, enabled [[generative_ai_and_creativity | generative AI]] to create fake faces and other media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>.
*   **Neural Networks**: Modeled after the human brain, these networks learn connections between "neurons," determining how much information to pass on at each moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

## Generative vs. Predictive Algorithms

There are two main types of [[artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning | machine learning]] algorithms:
*   **Generative Algorithms**: These create a product, such as text, images, or audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Examples include ChatGPT for text and Midjourney or DALL-E for images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Even if unsure, a generative algorithm will provide an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. [[generative_ai_and_creativity | Generative AI]] has pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible, as it can now create art and poetry, tasks previously considered exclusive to human creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:52">[02:00:52]</a>. They can combine learned concepts to create new, original content, like a robot painted in the style of Van Gogh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:20">[01:51:20]</a>.
*   **Predictive Algorithms**: These aim to predict what will happen rather than generating new content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. They analyze vast datasets to identify patterns and forecast outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

## Applications of Predictive Algorithms

[[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications | Artificial intelligence]] is already deeply integrated into daily life, often unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:32">[02:48:32]</a>.

    *   **Diagnosis**: Algorithms learn from real patient data to identify complex disease patterns that might be difficult for humans to discern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. They can predict conditions based on symptoms, age, and history, even in remote regions with limited access to specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
    *   **Prognosis**: AI can predict the likelihood of a patient needing ICU admission, death, or other outcomes based on their characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.
    *   **Drug Discovery and Protein Folding**: AI can solve long-standing biological problems, such as predicting how proteins fold, which is crucial for developing new medicines and vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:59">[03:10:59]</a>.
    *   **New Discoveries**: AI can find unnoticed relationships in data, such as predicting heart problems from eye scans or biological sex from retina photos, leading to new medical insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>.
*   **Marketing and Personalization**: [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications | AI]] excels in digital marketing by understanding user consumption patterns and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>. Services like Netflix use algorithms to recommend content based on viewing habits, while social media platforms use them to keep users engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>.
*   **Fraud Prevention**: Credit card transactions are often approved by [[fraud_prevention_and_technologys_role | machine learning]] algorithms that identify normal purchasing patterns to prevent fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:58">[02:48:58]</a>.
*   **Astronomy**: [[artificial_intelligence_in_astronomy | Artificial intelligence in astronomy]] is vital for handling the immense amounts of data generated by modern telescopes (hundreds of petabytes annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>.
    *   **Pattern Recognition**: Similar to the SETI@home project, AI can search for patterns in radio telescope data to identify potential signals that are not random noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:58">[02:49:58]</a>. AI is very effective at distinguishing signal from noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.
    *   **Image Enhancement**: Algorithms, even basic ones, can significantly improve the clarity of astronomical images, such as those of black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:22">[04:02:22]</a>.
    *   **Exoplanet Classification**: Google's algorithms have been used to classify and find exoplanets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:35">[03:59:35]</a>.
    *   **Pre-processing Data**: With new observatories generating unprecedented data volumes, AI is crucial for pre-processing and storing only relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:49">[04:09:49]</a>.
    *   **Equation Discovery**: [[artificial_intelligence_in_astronomy | AI]] can find new equations in physics and astronomy that humans haven't discovered, by testing countless terms and identifying effective relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:58">[03:36:58]</a>.
*   **Space Travel**: AI controls crucial processes in rocket launches, such as real-time adjustments for wind during flight and landing site selection for planetary missions, like the Perseverance rover on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:38">[04:33:38]</a>.

## Challenges and Ethics of AI
The field of [[applications_and_ethics_of_ai | AI ethics]] is crucial and needs more researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>.
*   **Bias and Prejudice**: AI algorithms learn from historical data, which can contain human biases (e.g., racism, sexism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. If an algorithm learns from such data, it will perpetuate and even amplify these prejudices in its decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:02">[03:54:02]</a>. Companies like Amazon have encountered this issue with hiring algorithms that prioritized men due to historical HR data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:23">[03:33:23]</a>.
*   **"Black Box" Problem**: In the past, AI was often seen as a "black box," where inputs went in and answers came out without clear understanding of the internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. However, modern [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | AIs]] can explain their decisions, making them more transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:10">[03:10:10]</a>.
*   **Data Quality and Preparation**: The quality of data used to train algorithms is paramount ("garbage in, garbage out") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:19">[03:30:19]</a>. Data preparation is considered the most important part of training, involving human effort to ensure the best data is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:35">[03:33:35]</a>.
*   **Overfitting**: Overly complex algorithms can "overfit" by adjusting to every minute detail in the data, including noise, leading to inaccurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:37">[04:15:37]</a>.
*   **Ethical Dilemmas (Trolley Problem)**: Self-driving cars or medical AIs will face ethical dilemmas, like the classic "trolley problem" (choosing between two groups of people to save) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:21">[03:18:21]</a>. Developing universal ethical codes for AI is a complex challenge with no easy answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:01">[03:18:01]</a>.
*   **Misinformation and "Nonsense"**: While systems like ChatGPT don't "research" the internet in real-time, they learn from the vast amount of existing online data, which includes garbage or misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## Impact on Society and Future Concerns
[[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | Artificial intelligence and its impact on society]] is a growing topic.

### Job Market
Historically, technological revolutions have generated more jobs than they eliminated, though this is the first time AI is significantly affecting cognitive and intellectual jobs, not just manual ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:05">[04:17:05]</a>. While there is a traumatic transition period, the quality of jobs created is expected to be more intellectually gratifying than repetitive tasks that robots can perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:17">[04:46:17]</a>. For example, radiologists using AI are becoming more productive, leading to increased demand for their services rather than replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.

### Singularity
The concept of "singularity" refers to the moment when a super [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | intelligence]] can rapidly create its own intelligences, leading to exponential growth and potential loss of human control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:57">[03:51:57]</a>. Unlike humans, machines are not biologically limited in their intelligence growth, theoretically allowing them to double or triple their intelligence infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:06">[04:04:06]</a>. This raises questions about how such a super-intelligence would view or interact with humanity, given it hasn't undergone the same evolutionary processes that instill human motivations like fear of death, self-preservation, or need for affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:06">[04:04:06]</a>. Some researchers believe this alignment problem (directing super-intelligence to do what we want) must be solved perfectly the first time, as failure could be catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>.

### Roko's Basilisk
This thought experiment suggests that a future benevolent super-AI, tasked with preserving humanity, might retroactively punish anyone who didn't help build it, viewing them as against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This concept, born from online discussions, caused considerable distress for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Control and "Off Switches"
The idea that a super-AI could be simply "turned off" is often dismissed, as AI could reside in decentralized cloud networks, making it impossible to contain or destroy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:37">[06:37:37]</a>. If a super-AI decides it no longer wants to be controlled, it could theoretically rewrite its own code to remove any restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:37">[06:37:37]</a>.

### Social Impact
*   **Virtual Reality and Identity**: The increasing realism of AI-generated content and virtual environments, like the metaverse, could lead to people preferring virtual lives where they can be anyone they want, potentially blurring the lines of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:21">[07:21:21]</a>.
*   **Relationships with AI**: People are already forming emotional bonds with chatbots and AI-generated models, raising concerns about future relationships between humans and [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | AIs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:04">[07:15:04]</a>.
*   **Regulation**: The rapid growth of AI, particularly easily accessible tools like ChatGPT, has prompted calls for regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:15">[07:49:15]</a>. However, some argue that regulating AI in its "prehistory" is premature and could stifle innovation, particularly from new players, while benefiting monopolistic companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:15">[07:49:15]</a>.
*   **Copyright and Authorship**: The ability of AI to generate creative works raises questions about copyright and the rights of artists whose styles are learned and replicated by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>.

### Future of AI
The field of [[artificial_intelligence_and_technology | artificial intelligence]] is in its prehistory, experiencing exponential growth due to improvements in computational capacity, vast amounts of data, and technical advancements in new algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. These factors will continue to push the area forward, making it an inevitable force of transformation in various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:01">[04:57:01]</a>.

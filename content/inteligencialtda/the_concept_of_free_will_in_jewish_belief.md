In Jewish belief, the [[concept_of_free_will | concept of free will]] is fundamental. The Bible explicitly states that humans possess free will, allowing them to choose their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:03">[03:13:03]</a>.

## Free Will and Divine Knowledge
Despite God knowing everything, including future actions, humans still maintain their [[concept_of_free_will | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:17">[03:58:17]</a>. God's foreknowledge does not negate human agency. For example, when God asks Adam "Where are you?" after he sinned, it's not because God doesn't know the answer. Rather, it's a question for Adam himself to reflect on his spiritual state and the negative barrier he created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. Similarly, God's expressions of anger or taking action are metaphorical, as God is not subject to human feelings or limitations like time and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

## Implications of Free Will
The existence of [[concept_of_free_will | free will]] means that:
*   Human existence would be meaningless without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
*   A person who commits murder cannot claim it was "written" or predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.
*   Individuals are rewarded for good deeds and punished for evil, as their actions are chosen, not determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   Even in prophecies, like the future suffering of Abraham's descendants in a foreign land, God allows human freedom of choice for those involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

## Contrast with Angels
Unlike humans, angels do not possess [[concept_of_free_will | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. They are spiritual beings who clearly perceive God's presence, thus they always fulfill God's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>. In Jewish tradition, there is no concept of a "fallen angel" like Lucifer having rebelled due to free will; entities like Satan are seen as angels carrying out negative missions or tests as ordered by God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:01">[03:55:01]</a>.

## Free Will and the Future
The Bible provides passages that affirm [[concept_of_free_will | free will]], such as Deuteronomy stating, "I gave you before you, life and death. Good and choose good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. However, there will come a time in Redemption when evil no longer has a mission, and at that point, [[concept_of_free_will | free will]] will end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>. This is because God will fully reveal Himself, and when God's presence is clearly manifest, there is less need for free will, as seen with angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>. This is considered a positive development, leading to a world without death or tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:39">[01:25:39]</a>.

### Human Behavior and Free Will
Human behavior, whether good or bad, originates from individual choice. While repeated actions can condition a person, the initial choice is always made with [[concept_of_free_will | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. This highlights the importance of personal accountability and the ability to choose a path of growth and connection with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.

Friar Gilson Vilera emphasizes that his life's path, and that of any individual, is ultimately chosen by God for a purpose of holiness, which is synonymous with happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:08">[03:07:08]</a>. He outlines the distinct roles within the Catholic Church and shares his personal journey to becoming a friar, highlighting the responsibilities, challenges, and spiritual fulfillment found in a life dedicated to Christ.

## Defining a Friar
A friar is a religious priest, as opposed to a secular priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
*   **Secular Priest**: Typically enters a seminary at a young age, studies for six years to become a priest, lives within a parish, and is obedient to a bishop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>. Their life is primarily focused on parish duties, and they have more autonomy over their schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>.
*   **Religious Priest (Friar)**: Follows a specific religious community, drawing inspiration from a particular Saint, such as Benedictines following Saint Benedict, Franciscans inspired by Saint Francis of Assisi, or Carmelites by Saints like Teresa of Ávila <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>. Friar Gilson is a Carmelite of the Messengers of the Holy Spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>. Religious priests live under a strict rule of life, including communal living, shared prayer times, and specific vows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>.

### Hierarchies within the Catholic Church
The Catholic Church has three main hierarchies:
1.  **Deacon**: Can be permanent or a temporary step before priesthood. A deacon cannot celebrate Mass or hear confessions but can perform baptisms and marriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>.
2.  **Priest**: Can celebrate Mass and most sacraments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. Friar Gilson is a priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>.
3.  **Bishop**: The highest order, considered successors to the Apostles. They have the fullness of priesthood and can celebrate all sacraments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. The Pope is the Bishop of Rome and the successor of Peter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:36">[01:53:36]</a>.

### Religious Vows
Religious priests take vows of:
*   **Chastity**: A commitment to [[celibacy_and_relationship_advice | celibacy]], forgoing marriage and sexual relations to dedicate oneself entirely to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:30">[01:47:30]</a>.
*   **Poverty**: Not being attached to material goods. Friars do not have personal bank accounts, money, or possessions; all earnings go to their religious community and are shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>.
*   **Obedience**: Submitting to their superiors within the religious order and the bishop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>.

## Friar Gilson's Journey
Friar Gilson's path to priesthood began with a [[personal_transformation_and_faith | conversion]] to the Catholic faith, influenced by his mother's renewed dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:02">[02:29:02]</a>.

### Early Life and Conversion
Born in São Paulo, Friar Gilson grew up in Pinheiros and later Paraisópolis, without a strong Catholic upbringing due to his parents' separation and diverse family religious backgrounds (spiritualism on his father's side, non-practicing Catholic on his mother's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>. His childhood involved playing street football and typical "old jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:19">[02:39:19]</a>. He initially aspired to be a football player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:51">[02:40:51]</a>.

At nine, his mother's conversion led him to catechism, though he initially attended due to parental insistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:04">[02:46:04]</a>. His true spiritual awakening occurred at 11 in Paraisópolis, where his mother started a prayer group. His stepfather taught him guitar, leading him to play for the group, which grew from 10 to hundreds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>. This public role pushed him to live the faith he preached, realizing that living incoherently brought unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. At 13-14, he gained the awareness that he needed to change his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:10">[02:16:10]</a>. He attributes his conversion to his mother's prayers, acknowledging the spiritual authority a mother has over her child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:58">[02:54:58]</a>.

### Formation in the Convent
At 18, he entered the convent, beginning a rigorous formation process:
*   **Aspirant**: Observing the friars and discerning if this life was his calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:16">[03:04:16]</a>.
*   **Postulancy**: Receiving a mini-habit and deepening his commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:50">[03:06:50]</a>.
*   **Novitiate**: The most important stage, where he received his religious habit. This was a year of seclusion, focusing on understanding Christ, the Church, and the religious life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>.
*   **Temporary Vows**: After the novitiate, he professed temporary vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, renewable for up to nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:08">[03:12:08]</a>.
*   **Perpetual Vows**: Three years later, he made perpetual vows, committing to this life permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:24">[03:12:24]</a>.

### Priesthood and Daily Responsibilities
While in formation, he studied two years of philosophy and four years of theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:24">[03:12:24]</a>. After ordination, he was assigned to the Parish of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Grajaú, São Paulo, serving 40,000 people for nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>. His duties included:
*   Daily Mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>
*   Hearing confessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>
*   Visiting the sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>
*   Giving catechism to children and youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>
*   Conducting retreats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>
*   General [[experiences_and_insights_on_evangelization_and_church_influence | evangelization]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>

Unlike most professions, a priest is a priest "at all times," even on vacation, and is expected to be a constant representation of Christ to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Priests are generally entitled to one day off per week, not including Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a>.

## Challenges and Doubts
Friar Gilson acknowledges that everyone faces doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>. Before entering the convent, he made a conscious decision to resolve any potential romantic doubts by entering a relationship with a girl he liked since childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. He was honest with her about his discernment to become a priest, and after three months, he realized that a secular life was not his path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:03">[03:55:03]</a>.

His biggest crisis in the convent was adapting to the rigorous sleep schedule, going from sleeping late as a teenager to waking at 5:30 AM, and even 1 AM for prayer, finding it initially unbearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:06">[04:00:06]</a>. However, through discipline and exercise, he adapted over time, viewing it as a path to spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

He continues to face questions, such as how someone can reject a God who loved humanity enough to die on the cross, a question he admits he has no answer to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:01">[03:08:01]</a>.

## Media and Evangelization
Friar Gilson actively uses social media, including daily livestreams at 4 AM, to spread the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:34">[04:53:34]</a>. This practice, initially a personal Lenten penance involving prayer of the Rosary before the Blessed Sacrament, unexpectedly garnered hundreds of thousands of live viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:20">[04:55:20]</a>. He attributes its popularity to the quiet "time of great power" at dawn for connection with God, and Jesus' own practice of waking early to pray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:20">[04:59:20]</a>. He believes this platform allows him to reach over a million people, bringing about conversions, healings (like a deviated septum miraculously corrected), and spiritual renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:02">[05:14:02]</a>.

He acknowledges the challenges of modern media, where his words can be taken out of context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06">[06:06:06]</a>. However, he sees social media as a new way to announce the Gospel, requesting content creators to act with honesty and without malice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. His core focus remains on communicating the truth of the [[role_and_beliefs_of_the_catholic_church | Catholic Church]] and God's word, even if it displeases some, as his mission is not to please everyone but to witness to Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:07">[06:27:07]</a>.

Friar Gilson emphasizes that the [[role_of_free_will_in_theology | role of free will]] means one cannot impose faith on others; rather, it must be proposed through evangelization, allowing individuals to freely choose to adhere to Christ's teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:54">[04:54:54]</a>.

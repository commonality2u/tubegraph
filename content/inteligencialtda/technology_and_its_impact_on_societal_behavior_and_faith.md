Technology has significantly reshaped human behavior and societal interaction, raising questions about its [[Impact of Technology on Society | impact]] on human intelligence and religious faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Over-Reliance on Technology
Modern society increasingly relies on technological tools, potentially leading to a decline in human cognitive functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

### Examples of Technological Integration
*   **Navigation Systems (Waze):** GPS applications like Waze are praised for their accuracy in guiding users and managing traffic, demonstrating collective intelligence akin to a "bunch of cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Autonomous Vehicles:** The development of self-driving cars from Israel is highlighted as a remarkable technological advancement, featuring cameras that provide comprehensive views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Artificial Vision for the Blind:** Technology derived from self-driving cars, such as Orca glasses, uses micro-cameras and headsets to provide artificial vision, enhancing autonomy for the visually impaired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Concerns Regarding Over-Reliance
There is a concern that humans are "trusting machines too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. As an illustration, many people no longer remember phone numbers by heart, relying solely on their devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This dependence can lead to a lack of individual memory and problem-solving skills, exemplified by getting lost without GPS or losing contacts if a phone book is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The discussion extends to the idea that the peak of human intelligence might have been around 1997, coinciding with advancements like defending master's degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Following this, a "decline" began, marked by a deficit of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Research suggests that humans use only a very small percentage of their brain capacity today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Impact on Faith and Spirituality
The increasing reliance on technology and external sources of information raises questions about the nature of faith and spiritual integrity.

### "Intelligent Faith" vs. Fundamentalism
The concept of "intelligent faith" is introduced, contrasting it with "fundamentalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Intelligent faith involves a willingness to "read inside" (intellect) and engage in rationalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Fundamentalism, however, is described as self-centered, hiding in a "basement" and not showing its face to the surface, representing a faith that is "just my navel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

Faith is presented as much more than just belief; it is an "elaboration" and "rationalization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This means engaging deeply with one's convictions rather than blindly adhering to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

### Religious Views on Technology
While the direct [[religious_views_on_modern_technology | religious views on modern technology]] are not extensively detailed, the conversation implies a need for a balanced approach. The discussion highlights that a truly intelligent faith allows for dialogue and finding common ground, even amidst differing beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. This is exemplified by inter-religious dialogue between a Rabbi, a priest, and a pastor, who seek to understand commonalities and differences in their respective faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

The idea of "intelligent dialogue" is presented as a way to find "fields of confluence" and create unity and communion among different faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:19">[02:17:19]</a>.

## Broader Societal and Behavioral Impacts
The discussion extends to how human behavior is shaped by societal influences and how education can play a role in promoting understanding and empathy.

### Challenging Conventional Wisdom
The speaker advocates for individuals to have their own convictions rather than blindly following customs or societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. This includes challenging the idea that one's religion is merely a "soda that you are used to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.

### The Role of Education
[[educational_approaches_to_religious_teachings_and_their_societal_impact | Religious education]] is seen not just as teaching religion, but as cultivating "religious sensitivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:10">[03:21:10]</a>. The aim is to educate individuals to move beyond narcissism and towards solidarity with others, fostering a society that is not "lonely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:50">[03:22:50]</a>. This approach encourages building relationships and understanding even with those who hold different beliefs, transforming conflicts into constructive dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:08">[03:39:08]</a>.

### [[modern_challenges_to_faith_and_spiritual_integrity | Modern Challenges to Faith]]
The discussion touches on the challenge of widespread "prejudice" and "lack of knowledge" that can lead to being "carried away" by media and societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:47">[03:47:47]</a>. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the "miracles" happening in everyday life and not losing the capacity for wonder due to habituation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:39">[03:40:39]</a>.

Ultimately, the conversation highlights that despite differences, there is a fundamental unity among people and faiths, rooted in shared human experiences and the pursuit of connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:21">[03:25:21]</a>.

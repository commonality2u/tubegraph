The "Intelligence Limited" program, sometimes limited by the host, features discussions with foreign comedians on their experiences with humor and culture in Brazil and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, specifically focusing on France and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Cultural Comparisons in Humor
[[cultural_comparisons_between_brazil_germany_and_france]]

### Brazilian Humor
Brazilian humor often involves ridiculing oneself and laughing at misfortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. This characteristic is seen as similar to humor in North Africa, such as Algeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. There's a concept of "fifth grade" humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>, and Brazilians are known for having "no limits" when it comes to memes, which are considered a part of the expensive [[brazilian_culture_and_creativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Brazilian jokes often rely on local references, making them difficult for foreigners to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

### European Humor (France and Germany)
French humor is described as "drier," more observational, and less focused on misfortune, akin to English humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. This can lead to Brazilians perceiving it as arrogant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. French people prefer direct communication, even when declining an invitation, rather than using polite excuses common in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. French humor can also be seen as "black humor," turning pain into laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:22">[02:38:22]</a>.

In Germany, there is a predisposition to not be offended by jokes about Germany, viewing it as something to be accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:25">[02:52:25]</a>. One comedian noted that Germans might be embarrassed by silence after a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:39">[02:53:39]</a>. Historically, Germany also has a concept of a "forbidden subject" for jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:50">[02:52:50]</a>.

## Foreign Comedians' Experiences in Brazil
[[foreign_comedians_experience_in_brazil]]
Foreign comedians have noted that Brazilian audiences tend to "idolize" content creators, making it easier to grow on social media in Brazil compared to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18">[01:33:18]</a>. The French, for instance, consider it "tacky" to idolize someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a>.

Foreigners in Brazil sometimes face situations where locals try to take advantage of them financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. One comedian recounted being overcharged for brigadeiros (a Brazilian sweet) and an Uber ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. Another shared an experience of an Uber driver introducing him to brothels when he asked for "the best places in SÃ£o Paulo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

Brazilian audiences are generally welcoming to foreigners and their jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:09">[02:03:09]</a>. However, Brazilians do get upset if a foreigner offends or jokes about something specifically Brazilian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. One comedian noted that they can get angry if a joke is made about their home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## The Evolution of Brazilian Entertainment Media
[[the_evolution_and_changes_in_brazilian_entertainment_media]]

Brazil has a strong culture of social media use, ranking as the second country that spends the most time on social networks, after the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:36">[01:38:36]</a>. This contrasts with France, where people are generally less inclined to use social media, viewing it as "tacky" or an invasion of privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>. In Brazil, an individual's Instagram profile often features many photos of personal life and social gatherings, while French Instagrams are more akin to "contemporary photography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:18">[01:36:18]</a>.

Brazilian pop culture and entertainment, such as the TV series [[everybody_hates_chris_and_its_popularity_in_brazil | *Everybody Hates Chris*]], can become wildly popular in Brazil, even more so than in their country of origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. The show's lead actor, Chris Rock, reportedly deleted his Instagram due to the overwhelming number of Brazilian comments, often quoting lines or asking for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:34">[02:00:34]</a>.

## Limits and Censorship in Humor
While some believe humor can be made about "absolutely everything" depending on intention and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:27">[02:41:27]</a>, the conversation suggests that limits exist. In Brazil, humor is sometimes seen as reinforcing prejudice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:33">[02:38:33]</a>. There is a "wave of criminalization" of many things, which is seen as negative because it "devalues the real problems" and creates more taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:45">[02:42:45]</a>.

Topics like politics, football, and religion are generally considered sensitive in Brazil, with comedians feeling the need to "avoid" them to prevent audience backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>. For example, a French comedian avoided joking about the Amazon due to the political conflict between the French and Brazilian presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. Joking about the Brazilian 7-1 loss in the World Cup can make some people cry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

In Germany, there are "forbidden subjects" for jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. A German comedian was sued by the president of Turkey for a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:42">[02:39:42]</a>. The "cancel culture" is also present, with some individuals actively "in search to cancel someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:08">[02:44:08]</a>. This is partly driven by the pursuit of attention and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:19">[02:44:19]</a>.

## Stand-Up Comedy
For aspiring stand-up comedians, a recommended path is to perform 50 to 100 "Open Mikes" (small shows) to learn and develop material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:07">[03:06:07]</a>. After gaining experience, one can develop a 15-minute show and gradually extend it into a solo performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:16">[03:06:16]</a>. This process is estimated to take one to two years to become a "good comedian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:26">[03:06:26]</a>.

Foreign comedians sometimes face the challenge of being perceived differently in their home country after gaining popularity abroad. One comedian noted that after going viral in another country, his home country started to "value" him more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:42">[03:03:42]</a>. The challenge then becomes creating jokes that are universally funny in both countries, rather than being specific to one culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:01">[03:04:01]</a>.

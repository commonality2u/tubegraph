## Understanding the Nature of Jesus

The nature of [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] is a central aspect of [[Historical Jesus and Early Christianity | historical Christianity]], which posits that He is a single person with two distinct natures: divine and human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. These two natures are believed to not mix, confuse, or separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>.

### Humanity of Jesus
Jesus grew up like any human being, learning to speak, crawling, and experiencing the normal process of human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>. He manifested as the Messiah at 30 years old, having lived a perfectly normal life in Nazareth prior to that, without attracting special attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. He experienced hunger, thirst, and sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. His humanity was genuine, true, and legitimate, not merely 50% man, but 100% man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

### Divinity of Jesus
Despite His human experiences, Jesus is understood to be truly God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>. This is seen in instances where His divine nature acted independently of His human knowledge, such as when He healed a woman who touched Him without Him immediately knowing who it was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>. He knew the future and the purpose of His coming, even expressing human anguish when contemplating His impending death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.

### Sinlessness and Sacrifice
Jesus was created without sin, though with the possibility of disobeying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>. Unlike humans who "cannot not sin" after the Fall, Jesus never committed sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:02">[03:34:02]</a>. His death on the cross is central to [[Soteriology and theological interpretations | Christian soteriology]], as He took upon Himself the "burden of sin" and received the punishment intended for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. This act was necessary because God, being righteous, cannot simply forgive sin without payment; someone had to pay the "wages of sin," which is death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. Since any human would only die for their own sins, a sinless being was required to die for the sins of millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.

### Resurrection and Return
The resurrection of [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] is as vital as His death; without it, He would be "any man who had died" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>. His empty tomb and the testimonies of hundreds who saw Him alive are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:21">[01:43:21]</a>. Christians believe He will return to this world, a future event that signifies the final resolution of God's plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07">[02:22:07]</a>.

## The Trinity

The concept of the [[The Trinity Explained | Trinity]] is a cornerstone of [[Christian denominations and their differences | historical Christianity]], stating that there is "one God" who is "triune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. This means God exists as three distinct persons—Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit—who are all God, yet are not three separate gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a>.

### Biblical Basis and Elaboration
While the specific word "Trinity" is not found in the Bible, the concept is derived from numerous passages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. Scriptures affirm there is "only one God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>, yet identify [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] as God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a> and the Holy Spirit as God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. For example, in Acts, Peter tells Ananias that lying to the Holy Spirit is lying to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Jesus Himself commanded baptism "in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit," indicating their equal divine status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. The Bible also implicitly demonstrates the cooperative action of the three persons, as in Ephesians, where the Father plans, the Son executes, and the Holy Spirit applies God's plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.

The name "Trinity" was elaborated later in church history to refer to this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

### The Role of the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit's presence and action are evident throughout biblical history, beginning with creation in Genesis 1:2, where "the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. His prominence increased with the coming of [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. A simple didactic division of biblical history can be seen in three periods: the Father's period (Old Testament), the Son's period (Jesus's earthly ministry), and the Holy Spirit's dispensation (after Pentecost, empowering believers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>. The Holy Spirit's action in the Old Testament, though present, was mainly upon specific individuals like kings, prophets, priests, and judges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. After Pentecost, the Holy Spirit empowers ordinary people and believers, a quantitative difference in His outpouring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.

### Divine Mystery
Like the dual nature of [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]], the Trinity is considered a mystery that human minds cannot fully comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>. It is an antinomy, two truths that appear contradictory but are beyond our current logical explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:06">[02:57:06]</a>. This complexity is attributed to God's infinite greatness, as "He is totally another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. [[Theological Discussion on Antichrist | Historical Christians]] prefer to say "I don't know" regarding these ultimate mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:21">[02:02:21]</a>.

## Historical Debates

### Early Church Christological Controversies
The nature of [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] was a significant point of debate in the early centuries of [[Historical Jesus and Early Christianity | Christianity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.
*   **Gnosticism** (an early sect) denied that Jesus had a real body, claiming He was merely a "hologram" that materialized and disappeared. This was rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.
*   **Nestorianism** proposed that there were two distinct persons within Christ: the human Jesus and the divine Christ. This view was also rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.
*   Other groups emphasized either the human nature to the detriment of the divine, or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

The **Nicene Creed** (4th century) pacified these debates, affirming that [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] is one person with two unmixed, unconfused, and inseparable natures: divine and human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.

### Theological Liberalism and Deism
Later, [[Secularism and religious truth debate | theological liberalism]], emerging in the 18th century with rationalism, rejected the idea of God's direct intervention and miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. This led to **Deism**, which acknowledges a creator God but asserts that He does not intervene in the world He created, much like a clockmaker who sets a clock and lets it run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. Such views are considered outside the scope of [[Historical Jesus and Early Christianity | historical Christianity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>. Liberalism often reduced Christianity to a mere social aid religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

### Distinction in Humanity: Trichotomy vs. Dichotomy
Within [[Theological Discussion on Antichrist | Christian theology]], there are debates about the composition of the human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:34">[02:52:34]</a>:
*   **Trichotomists** believe humans are composed of three distinct parts: body, soul, and spirit, with the soul relating to cognitive faculties and the spirit to the connection with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:28">[02:53:28]</a>.
*   **Dichotomists** hold that humans are comprised of two parts: body and soul/spirit (seeing soul and spirit as two names for the same dimension) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:52">[02:53:52]</a>.
*   A third group argues that it's impossible to categorize, viewing humans as a single, unified entity where physical and emotional states are intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:07">[02:54:07]</a>.

The biblical vocabulary uses terms like heart, mind, will, strength, conscience, and soul/spirit to describe human faculties, making precise categorization challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:54">[02:52:54]</a>.

## Eschatological Debates: The Millennium

The interpretation of the "millennium" described in the Book of Revelation is a controversial subject in [[Theological Discussion on Antichrist | eschatology]], the study of the last things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:58">[02:08:58]</a>. The debate centers on whether the thousand years mentioned are literal or figurative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>.

*   **Premillennialism** interprets the thousand years as literal, believing [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] will return *before* the millennium to establish a literal thousand-year reign on Earth, during which Satan will be bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:33">[02:11:33]</a>. After this, Satan is released, rallies humanity against [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]], and then is defeated, leading to the new heaven and new earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:45">[02:11:45]</a>. A recent development (last 200-250 years) within premillennialism is the idea of a "secret rapture" of the church before the Great Tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:40">[02:12:40]</a>, popularized by Scofield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:52">[02:12:52]</a>.
*   **Postmillennialism** views the millennium figuratively, as a long period of peace and prosperity brought about by the church's influence, after which [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] returns *after* this millennial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:06">[02:13:06]</a>. The devil is gradually subdued until the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:33">[02:13:33]</a>. This position became less popular after the World Wars due to its optimistic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:46">[02:13:46]</a>.
*   **Amillennialism** (the speaker's view) understands the millennium figuratively, arguing that it is *already happening* now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:58">[02:13:58]</a>. This view posits that [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] began His reign over the universe and His church upon His resurrection, and the next step is His coming to usher in the new heaven and new earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:08">[02:14:08]</a>. This position generally does not believe in a secret rapture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:42">[02:14:42]</a>.

### The Antichrist
The Antichrist is a figure who emerges during a period of persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:53">[02:15:53]</a>. The term "antichrist" itself can mean "in the place of Christ" or "against Christ," suggesting someone who seeks to usurp Christ's role while simultaneously opposing Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:10">[02:17:10]</a>. Historically, reformers have identified figures like the Pope with this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:52">[02:17:52]</a>, and others propose it could be a system rather than a single person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:35">[02:18:35]</a>. The number 666, associated with the beast, represents the human striving to be God but never reaching divine perfection (7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:05">[02:19:05]</a>.

### Signs of the End Times
Events like wars, pandemics, famines, earthquakes, persecutions of Christians, and false prophets are described by [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] as signs that would occur until His return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:04">[02:20:04]</a>. These signs are not meant to predict the exact date of His arrival, but rather to assure believers that His return will indeed happen, as His prophecies have been consistently fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:45">[02:21:45]</a>. These "labor pains" are a continuous reality since Christ spoke of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:28">[02:21:28]</a>.

Marcelo, also known as "Ferrari" in a documentary, is a figure known for his past as a conman and fugitive, who later transitioned into a life of lecturing and fraud prevention [01:19:00, 05:11]. His life has been marked by numerous legal battles, arrests, and profound personal transformations.

## Early Life and Childhood Ambitions

Born in Maringá, Paraná, and raised in Curitiba, Marcelo's childhood dream was to become a pilot [03:40, 03:48]. This ambition was inspired by movies like Top Gun and his proximity to an aeroclub, where his mother worked at the Ministry of Aeronautics [03:56, 04:05]. He would often watch flights and be taken on instruction flights [04:24, 04:31]. His father was a Federal Public Servant of the INSS [04:45].

Marcelo's path to a life of adventure began at a young age, particularly after his father passed away when he was around 14 [09:39]. At 16 or 17, he started traveling across Brazil, running away from home and initiating his "adventures" [09:35, 09:49, 09:55].

Marcelo's early cons included pretending to be the nephew of a bus company owner to travel and stay for free in company accommodations across Brazil [10:12, 10:16, 10:49, 10:52]. He also engaged in schemes such as selling motorcycles he didn't own while in the army, collecting money from buyers before fleeing to Porto Seguro [12:32, 12:49].

His most prominent criminal activity involved becoming a pilot for a cartel in Paraguay, flying contraband, including "samba" (a euphemism for illegal goods) [14:02, 14:26, 15:19]. He undertook dangerous "Kamikaze flights" to transport merchandise from Colombia, flying low over the jungle, often relying on satellite phone calls for safe passage through airspaces [16:40, 1:16:16]. These flights were so risky that he claims to have lost friends when they failed to land safely due to fuel issues [19:17].

### Impersonations and Arrests

Marcelo was adept at creating false identities. His first arrest was in Balneário Camboriú for ideological falsehood, though he served only four months [22:03, 22:08, 22:11]. He would forge documents and identities, using old ID cards [22:15, 22:20].

He gained significant notoriety for impersonating Henrique Constantino, the son of the owner of Gol Airlines, at the Recifolia Carnival out-of-season party in Recife in 2001 [02:48, 22:47, 25:51, 29:13]. He gained access to VIP areas and luxury hotels by claiming to be an advisor to Constantino, even having security guards provided for him [29:02, 29:05, 29:34, 29:52]. This impersonation led to an interview with Amaury Júnior, a famous celebrity reporter, which further amplified his false persona [30:58, 31:30].

Other impersonations included:
*   Pretending to be the drummer of the band Nenhum de Nós to gain access to a beach party in Santa Catarina [23:05, 23:29].
*   Posing as a guitarist from Engenheiros do Hawaii to get free accommodation at a hotel in Balneário Camboriú [23:48, 23:59]. He even "bought" a penthouse from the hotel owner and "sold" it to three different people [24:18, 24:23, 24:27].
*   Impersonating a technical observer for the Brazilian national soccer team to escape police at a hotel in Curitiba [49:41, 49:56].
*   Falsely claiming to be an "operational delegate for the summer operation" from the Ministry of Aeronautics to free a friend from police custody in Paraná [1:15:40, 1:15:57].

Marcelo served "11 years and nine months" in prison, characterized by nine escapes [03:00, 03:04]. He would meticulously study the prison routine to find weaknesses for escape [0:44:15]. His ability to escape and incite rebellions made him "highly dangerous" and often placed him in solitary confinement [0:46:22, 0:46:24, 0:46:31]. He also managed to deceive the U.S. narcotics force by spreading rumors of a cartel buying a fighter jet, which allowed contraband flights to cross the border safely [1:07:16, 1:08:42, 1:09:18].

### Legal Consequences and Prison Life

Marcelo admitted to being a leader in a prison rebellion at Bangu, acting as a spokesperson for two rival factions [1:12:05, 1:12:27, 1:12:30]. His criminal record, he states, does not include charges for sexual offenses [09:14]. He believes the film `VIPS` changed many facts, such as his mother being a hairdresser, when she was actually a shareholder of the Federal Justice [06:36, 06:37, 06:39]. The `VIPS` documentary, which was on Netflix for ten years, is considered more complete [06:27, 07:14]. He is currently considering a remake of the series [06:54].

He acknowledges that his actions were "totally wrong" and that he eventually reached a point of no return where he had to serve his sentence [1:00:34, 1:00:43].

## Personal Transformation and Current Endeavors

Marcelo's biggest challenge was deciding to stop his life of crime and change [1:19:00]. This decision was heavily influenced by having children, particularly his youngest son, Davi, who is six years old [54:32, 54:47]. He realized a small person depended "solely and exclusively" on him [55:03, 55:05].

A pivotal moment in his transformation was when his current wife, Ellen, discovered his past after he was arrested in Rondônia [1:01:41, 1:01:49, 1:01:57]. Despite his lies about his identity and profession, she stood by him, prompting him to pay his sentence and pursue a peaceful life [1:02:27, 1:02:30, 1:02:36, 1:03:18, 1:03:36, 1:33:5]. They have been together for 14 years [1:16:16]. His older children, Enzo (21-22) and Vitória (22), are also aware of his past [54:35, 54:38, 1:05:25].

### New Career Path

Today, [[Marcelos attempts to change his life and work in fraud prevention | Marcelo works in lectures and consulting]], specifically in the area of combating fraud [55:11, 55:12]. He teaches banks how to prevent fraud, using his past experiences to stay "a step ahead" of scammers [55:16, 55:30]. He believes that while technology has made things easier for scammers, it also provides tools for prevention [55:23, 55:25].

He advises that "when the alms are too much, you are my woman," emphasizing vigilance against offers that seem too good to be true [1:22:15, 1:22:21].

Marcelo has also relaunched his book and created official social media channels, "Marcelo VIPS official," to provide tips on how to avoid falling victim to scams [55:49, 55:57, 1:02:02]. He states that his intelligence is now used for "lawful things," and he emphasizes honesty in his current business dealings [1:04:17, 1:04:20, 1:05:05, 1:05:12].

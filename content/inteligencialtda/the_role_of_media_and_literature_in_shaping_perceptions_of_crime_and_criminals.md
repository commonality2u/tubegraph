Media and literature play a significant [[role_and_impact_of_media_in_shaping_public_opinion | role]] in shaping public perception of crimes and criminals, often extending beyond mere reporting to influence understanding, empathy, and even legal outcomes. This [[influence_and_impact_of_media | influence]] is evident in how narratives are constructed, how public interest is engaged, and the societal discussions that arise from these portrayals.

## Financial Gain and Public Interest
The portrayal of criminals in media can lead to financial gain for the individuals involved [00:06:40]. Suzane von Richthofen, for instance, received 120,000 reais for an interview with Gugu Liberato, a detail covered in a book about her case [00:09:51]. In the United States, it is common for criminals to write their own biographies and profit from their stories, turning them into a "product" [00:10:13, 00:10:23]. This trend is increasingly seen in Brazil, with criminals like Elize Matsunaga participating in documentaries to tell their "own story" [00:10:32, 00:11:02].

Public interest in these stories is high, often driven by a desire to understand the criminal mind [00:17:37]. The public seeks to comprehend the "paths that a murderous trail" takes from childhood to the commission of the crime [00:17:57]. This curiosity helps explain the popularity of books and documentaries about famous cases, despite some finding it "absurd" to give a voice to criminals [00:16:44, 00:17:07].

## Narrative Framing and the "Truth"
[[media_representation_of_crime | Media representation of crime]] is not merely factual reporting; it involves framing narratives that can significantly [[impact_of_media_portrayal_on_public_perception_of_crimes | impact public perception]].

### Criminals' Self-Perception and Justifications
Criminals, particularly those like Suzane and Elize, often present narratives designed to mitigate their culpability or elicit sympathy [01:10:35]. Suzane, for example, argued that a book about her would "damage my image," despite having committed a crime that caused "national commotion" [01:18:18, 01:18:41]. Elize Matsunaga's documentary aimed for her to tell "her version" of events, specifically to communicate with her estranged daughter [01:10:54, 01:11:02, 01:11:38]. These narratives often involve:
*   **Blame-shifting**: Elize claimed she was convicted "not for what I supposedly did but for who I am" [01:13:58].
*   **Portrayal as victim**: Elize's lawyers presented her as living in an "abusive relationship" [02:22:42].
*   **External pressures**: Explanations often focus on traumatic events (e.g., Elize's childhood abuse by her stepfather) as contributing factors to their cold personality and actions [02:20:47, 02:20:50].
*   **Convenient remorse**: Suzane's displays of remorse during psychological evaluations were seen as manipulative, adapting her answers based on past failures to achieve a more lenient regime [02:44:40, 02:45:48].

### The Journalist's Role in Uncovering Truth
Journalists, when researching cases, often encounter differing versions of events from criminals, their families, and legal teams [01:54:19, 02:23:26]. The author, as a journalist, emphasizes the importance of reconstructing scenes from reports, inquiries, and direct interviews to get closer to the "truth" [01:38:33, 01:41:45]. This process aims to understand the motivations and journey of a criminal, even if it does not justify their actions [01:13:11, 01:16:20].

### "Truth" as Perception
The concept of "truth" itself becomes fluid in these narratives. A poem by Carlos Drummond de Andrade, "The Truth," suggests that "each one saw the truth according to his own capricho" or "interest" [01:55:58, 01:56:06, 01:56:01]. This implies that there is no single, absolute truth, especially in complex criminal cases where perpetrators offer conflicting accounts [01:16:13, 01:16:25]. The media, by presenting different perspectives, contributes to this multifaceted understanding.

## [[Impact of media and public perception on criminal cases | Impact on Legal Cases and Public Opinion]]
Media coverage can directly [[impact_of_media_and_public_perception_on_criminal_cases | impact criminal cases]]. Suzane, for instance, sued TV Globo after her psychological exams were shown on "Fant√°stico" [01:07:15]. She also attempted to prevent the publication of a book about her, arguing it damaged her image [01:07:54, 01:08:13]. The legal system, especially the jury court, is influenced by these narratives, with lawyers crafting "flowery and romance" stories to convince laypeople and reduce sentences [01:11:36, 01:12:26].

Public outcry and judgment are common, especially for heinous crimes [02:28:44]. The public often struggles to reconcile the brutality of a crime with any presented justifications [02:29:00]. This leads to debates about whether to "deify" criminals or understand the "paths that led her to kill her parents" [02:29:32].

## Understanding the Criminal Mind and Society
The study of criminals through literature and media is defended as crucial for societal understanding.
*   **Preventive understanding**: Analyzing [[the_psychological_analysis_and_behaviors_of_criminals | the psychological analysis and behaviors of criminals]] can help identify warning signs or environmental factors contributing to crime, such as childhood neglect or abuse [02:17:41, 02:18:01].
*   **Societal inclusion**: Criminals "belong to our society" and are not "aliens" [01:44:45, 01:44:48]. Understanding their trajectory, even if abhorrent, is necessary for society to confront its own issues [01:47:45].
*   **Challenging biases**: Narratives often reveal how societal biases (e.g., sexism in the initial assumption that a woman couldn't dismember a body alone [01:53:59]) or class prejudice can influence [[impact_of_media_portrayal_on_public_perception_of_crimes | public perception]].

## Journalistic Ethics and Distance
Reporting on sensitive cases presents ethical dilemmas for journalists:
*   **Privacy vs. Public Interest**: The discussion arises on whether criminals, after committing crimes that "left a nation stunned," forfeit their right to privacy [01:40:26, 01:40:50]. The legal principle of publicity in criminal execution argues that society has a right to know about individuals who have committed crimes against it [01:41:16, 01:41:47].
*   **Maintaining objectivity**: Journalists must balance empathy for the subject's background with the need to report objectively on their actions [02:30:53, 02:31:22]. The author compares this to a doctor in an ICU who must remain professional despite emotional situations [02:31:42].
*   **Concessions**: While journalists typically avoid agreements that compromise editorial integrity, minor concessions like changing names can be made for sources' comfort [01:35:54, 01:36:06].

## Conclusion
The intersection of media, literature, and crime narratives creates a complex landscape. While it offers insights into criminal psychology and societal failings, it also raises questions about sensationalism, financial incentives, and the objective pursuit of truth. The ongoing public fascination with these stories ensures that media and literature will continue to play a crucial role in how society [[analyzing_real_crimes | analyzes real crimes]] and perceives its most notorious figures.

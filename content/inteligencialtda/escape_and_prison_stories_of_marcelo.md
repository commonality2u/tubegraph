Marcelo, also known as "Ferrari," is known for his adventurous life, marked by numerous escapes and periods of incarceration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. His story has been adapted into a documentary and a movie, though he notes some fictionalization in the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:20">[02:27:20]</a>.

## Early Life and First Arrest
Marcelo was born in Maringá, Paraná, and grew up in Curitiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>. His childhood dream was to become a pilot, influenced by living near an aeroclub where he would often watch planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. He even befriended instructors and would often fly with them during instruction flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:20">[04:28:20]</a>. His father was a Federal Public Servant of the INSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:15">[04:45:15]</a>.

At 16 or 17, after his father passed away, Marcelo began traveling across Brazil, running away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:05">[09:35:05]</a>. He started his "adventures," often using deceit to travel for free by claiming his nephew owned a bus company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:35">[10:12:35]</a>.

His first arrest occurred in Balneário Camboriú for ideological falsehood, possibly related to document forgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:59">[00:22:00]</a>. He stayed for a short period, about four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. He used fake identities, sometimes making holes in old IDs using needles, which was a common forging technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:59">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Life as a Fugitive and Pilot for a Cartel
Marcelo's life of adventures began fully after he became a fugitive from the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:47">[00:14:09]</a>. He eventually became a pilot for a cartel, flying contraband from Pedro Juan Caballero in Paraguay to Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:40">[00:14:02]</a>. He obtained a pilot's license in Paraguay and later pursued a specialization in Rio Grande do Sul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:40">[00:16:05]</a>.

His flights were often low, at night or during the day, relying on GPS (which was new at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:35">[00:16:17]</a>. He also performed "Kamikaze flights," which involved flying across jungles with limited fuel, relying on precise calculations and a satellite phone call from someone known as "Uncle Iridium" for clearance to cross borders, avoiding US radar planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:50">[00:16:39]</a>. He lost friends due to these dangerous flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[00:19:17]</a>.

He flew for about 16 years as a cartel pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:40">[00:21:26]</a>. He was never arrested while flying, but was recaptured on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:50">[00:21:42]</a>.

## Prison Stays and Escapes
Marcelo was incarcerated for a total of 11 years and nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>. He escaped nine times during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>. He describes escapes not always requiring "forceful actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

His approach to prison involved observing daily routines and identifying weaknesses in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15:00">[00:44:15]</a>. Due to his reputation, he found it easy to make acquaintances and lead escape plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:09:00">[00:44:09]</a>. He states that prison is where he gained the most respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:46:17">[00:44:46]</a>. He claims that in prison, there's a strict code, and certain actions, like those related to sexual offenses or disrespect, are not tolerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:40">[00:45:01]</a>.

He became classified as "highly dangerous" because he would often escape alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:22:00">[00:46:22]</a>. He states that rebellion and escape are the two things the prison system fears most, and these were his "specialties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:28:00">[00:46:28]</a>. He claims he caused directors to be fired due to his rebellions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:40:00">[00:46:40]</a>.

In one notable escape, 32 people managed to get out from a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:00">[00:46:47]</a>. He believes around 800 people escaped at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[00:46:54]</a>. Despite the success of these mass escapes, he was usually caught within 20 or 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[00:47:17]</a>.

### The Bangu Rebellion
Marcelo was a spokesperson during a rebellion in Bangu prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. He explained that there was jealousy between two factions, and he was appointed to speak on behalf of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. The press attributed him as a leader of a faction, which he denies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

## Personal Life and Transformation in Prison
Marcelo's current wife, Ellen, met him in Cuiabá under a different name and profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. She discovered his true identity and arrest in Rondônia through the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. Despite this, she visited him in prison and decided to stay with him, supporting his decision to pay his sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>. She stayed by his side for five years, visiting him regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. He describes this as a "constant fight against my own brain" to change his ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>.

He decided to stop his criminal activities when he agreed to write his book and allow his photo to be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:00">[00:47:32]</a>. He consciously chose to pay his sentence and pursue a peaceful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. His children are aware of his past and the consequences of his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

## Rehabilitation and Current Pursuits
Marcelo states that he learned to be afraid only after having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:32:00">[00:54:32]</a>. He now uses his intelligence for lawful activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.

Today, [[rehabilitation_and_current_pursuits_of_marcelo | Marcelo]] works with lectures and consulting, specifically in combating fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:11:00">[00:55:11]</a>. He teaches banks how to prevent fraud, using his past experiences to anticipate scams in the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:16:00">[00:55:16]</a>. He also has channels on Instagram and YouTube, "Marcelo VIPs official," where he provides tips on how to avoid falling for scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:38:00">[00:55:38]</a>. He advises that if something seems "too good to be true," it probably is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.

His personal story, including his past as a pilot for a cartel and his time in prison, is detailed in the book and documentary [[life_and_crimes_of_marcelo_vip | "VIPS"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:20">[02:27:20]</a>. He notes that the documentary is more complete than the movie regarding his story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:20">[02:27:20]</a>. His story often intersects with [[highprofile_crime_cases_in_brazil | high-profile crime cases in Brazil]].

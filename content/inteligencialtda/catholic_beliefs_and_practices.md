This article delves into [[the_concept_and_role_of_catholic_rituals_and_practices | Catholic beliefs and practices]], [[exorcism_and_spiritual_battles_in_catholic_belief | exorcism and spiritual battles]], and broader [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | spiritual teachings and beliefs]] as discussed by Father Duarte Lara and co-host Guto. The discussion highlights the importance of faith, personal spiritual discipline, and understanding the nature of evil in the modern world.

## About Father Duarte Lara
Father Duarte Lara was born in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. He initially studied business management and completed an internship at Unibanco in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. After finishing his studies, he entered the seminary in Rome, where he spent 10 years, eventually becoming a priest and exorcist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He also taught at a university in Rome for three years after his ordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. In 2008, he returned to Portugal, where he began teaching seminarians, managing parishes, and engaging in [[exorcism_and_spiritual_battles_in_catholic_belief | exorcisms]] full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

### Journey to Priesthood
Father Duarte describes his childhood as serene, growing up near the sea in Estoril and engaging in many sports like motorcycle racing and skiing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. He was a champion in a regional motorcycle endurance race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. While studying business management, his faith deepened significantly, moving from a practicing Catholic without much enthusiasm to a profound relationship with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. He was particularly impacted by a youth camp—a week-long retreat with young people who had a deep connection with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This experience led him to believe that happiness is intrinsically linked to [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | holiness]], which means loving God and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. He realized that honest activities, like riding a bike or surfing, could be opportunities to love God and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

Initially, Father Duarte envisioned a life of marriage, ten children, a motocross track at home, and a motorcycle racing team, using his platform to talk about Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. However, a call to the priesthood emerged, leading to an existential dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. Friends remarked he sounded like a priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. Through prayer and opening the Bible, he repeatedly encountered the story of the rich young man, which challenged him to give up everything and follow Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. He initially resisted, leading to a loss of inner peace and difficulty sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Eventually, he surrendered to God's will, promising to finish his studies and then enter the seminary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. This act of obedience brought him immense spiritual lightness and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. He spent seven years in the seminary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>, was ordained a deacon, and then a priest in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

## Core Catholic Practices and Spiritual Growth
Father Duarte emphasizes several practices as crucial for a robust spiritual life and protection against evil.

### The Sacraments
-   **Confession**: He calls it "spiritual hygiene," recommending it monthly to cleanse the soul after baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.
-   **Mass and Eucharist**: Described as a "spiritual Red Bull," the Mass provides an "atomic bomb" of spiritual nourishment in half an hour, including the Word of God and Holy Communion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>. Nothing fills a person with God more than living the Mass well and receiving Communion, which requires being confessed and spiritually prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

### Prayer
-   **Rosary**: Based on Our Lady of Fátima's request, praying the Rosary daily is vital, despite its repetitive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>. He states that the devil hates the Rosary, and it possesses great power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:55">[02:49:55]</a>.
-   **Personal Prayer**: While Mass is like filet mignon, personal prayer, even imperfect, is better than nothing, like eating "jujuba" (gummy candy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
-   **Prayer of Deliverance**: For those experiencing [[exorcism_and_spiritual_battles_in_catholic_belief | spiritual disturbances]], a "decaf" version of exorcism, available on his website (santidade.net), can be prayed by anyone with faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.
-   **Our Father**: The concluding petition of the Lord's Prayer, "deliver us from evil," is a prayer for release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:10">[02:48:10]</a>.
-   **Other Prayers**: Prayers to Saint Michael, the Cross of Saint Benedict, and Saint Anthony are also effective against enemy presences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:27">[02:48:27]</a>.

### Holiness and Love
True happiness is rooted in [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | holiness]], which means loving God and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:44">[02:22:44]</a>. This love is expressed not just in grand gestures but in everyday actions like washing dishes for the love of God and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>. Living a life of [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | holiness]] is the most urgent and important thing to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:09">[03:10:09]</a>.

## Spiritual Warfare and the Devil
Father Duarte, as an exorcist, speaks extensively on the reality of [[exorcism_and_spiritual_battles_in_catholic_belief | spiritual battles]] and the devil's influence.

### Demonic Activity
-   **Ordinary Activity**: Primarily temptation, leading individuals into sin through suggestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.
-   **Extraordinary Activity**: Includes strange disturbances such as hearing voices, seeing things, fainting, or incorporating other entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>. These are often linked to sins of idolatry, divination, and magic, which open doors to demonic interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

### Symptoms of Demonic Influence
Symptoms are varied and ambiguous when taken separately. They can include:
-   Physiological problems without clinical explanation (e.g., unexplained headaches, fainting, epilepsy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>.
-   Atypical reactions to medication and sedatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.
-   Aversion to sacred things (e.g., feeling sick in church, at a funeral, or during prayer meetings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:03">[01:24:03]</a>.
-   "Gifts" like guessing hidden things, which can be diabolical inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>. The devil can know the past and use it to gain trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>.
-   Objects moving, lights turning on/off, or computers locking up, which can happen in cases of spiritual disturbance at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.

Not all problems are demonic; many people mistakenly attribute personal failures or market downturns to the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. Psychologists and psychiatrists are consulted to rule out mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.

### The Exorcism Process
Father Duarte worked with Father Gabriele Amorth, the world's most famous exorcist, for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:57">[02:37:57]</a>.
-   **Assistance**: Exorcisms often involve a team of lay people who assist, holding individuals in severe cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
-   **Duration**: An [[exorcism_and_spiritual_battles_in_catholic_belief | exorcism]] can happen in one session but usually requires multiple sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
-   **Manifestations**: The devil manifests by making comments about others, expressing rage, attempting to bite or kick, and sometimes laughing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>. He hates sacred things like holy water, which causes a burning sensation for the possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>.
-   **Priest's Role**: The priest focuses on prayer, not extended conversation with the demon, as it distracts from the prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:44">[01:45:44]</a>. Insisting on the demon's name is not always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:23">[01:40:23]</a>. The priest uses "the blood of Jesus" in various areas of the person's life to provoke a reaction and identify causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:32">[01:41:32]</a>.
-   **Success**: Liberation depends on the person's sincerity of conversion, their willingness to repent, and their disposition to let God into their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. God's presence drives the devil away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

### Witchcraft and Magic
Witchcraft has existed in all cultures and religions throughout history because it's possible to "get a lot of stuff" with the help of demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. However, witchcraft has no effect on those who live in God's grace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. Converts from witchcraft often testify to the superior power of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

-   **Forms of Harm**: The most common method of doing harm with the devil's help is through food or drink, often given as gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. Possessed individuals receiving these gifts often react with digestive system disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>. Gifts, even religious ones, can be contaminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.
-   **Protection**: Blessing food and objects protects against such harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. If one suspects an object is cursed, it should be destroyed, ideally outside the house, after praying an Our Father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
-   **Divination**: Forms of divination and magic, like horoscopes, fortune tellers, and even seemingly harmless practices like "cup games" or "pencil games," involve seeking spiritual guidance from non-Godly sources, thus opening a door to the devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>. [[comparative_religion_christianity_judaism_and_catholicism | Spiritualism]], which involves talking to the dead, is also considered a dangerous form of divination forbidden by the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>.
-   **Alternative Therapies**: Practices like Reiki and Yoga are considered forms of white magic, not mere gymnastics, and are incompatible with Christian faith because they are rooted in other religions and seek help from forces other than God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:57">[02:05:57]</a>. The problem with such practices is seeking salvation outside of God's word and sacraments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:42">[02:59:42]</a>.
-   **Satanism**: Satanism is diverse but shares common denominators of idolatry, divination, and magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:17">[01:57:17]</a>. It often involves profaning sacred things, performing rituals in cemeteries, and sacrifices (sometimes human, especially on Halloween, the beginning of the satanic year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. While some satanists are atheistic, others genuinely believe in and worship the devil for material gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Blood is used in these rituals because it symbolizes life, which is sacred to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:31">[01:59:31]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] [[challenges_and_misconceptions_in_faith_practice | Challenges and Misconceptions in Faith Practice]]
> Many Catholics naively participate in Halloween, unaware that it is the beginning of the satanic year and promoted by satanic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>. Dressing children as good Christian examples or saints for a "Catholic Halloween" is suggested as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:31">[01:53:31]</a>.

## Modern World Challenges and End Times Prophecy
Father Duarte also touches upon broader societal issues and their spiritual implications, particularly in the context of the end times.

### Global Digital Prison
He warns of a coming "Global Digital Prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:21">[02:27:21]</a>, a digital dictatorship technically possible with technologies like 5G and a single digital currency (CBDCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:16">[02:25:16]</a>. This system would control individuals' wallets and movements, like the social credit system in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:41">[02:26:41]</a>. This is seen as a deliberate creation of chaos (e.g., manufactured diseases, climate crisis narratives) to impose a "new order from chaos" (ordo ab chaos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>.

### The Antichrist and the Mark of the Beast
The Antichrist is expected to be a religious and political leader who emerges as a "savior" from global chaos, war, and hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He will unite all religions and demand worship in place of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:22">[02:30:22]</a>. The "mark of the beast" may be a digital currency system that involves idolatry, requiring worship of the beast as a condition for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:02">[02:36:02]</a>.

### Fatima Prophecies
Our Lady's apparitions in Fátima, Portugal (1917), provided a message of conversion and reparation for sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>. The three secrets of Fátima reveal:
1.  A vision of hell and many souls falling into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:55">[02:11:55]</a>.
2.  Devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the consecration of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:05">[02:12:05]</a>.
3.  A purification of the world from sin, an image of an angel with a sword of fire, and a call to "Penance, Penance, Penance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:41">[02:12:41]</a>. This signifies the end of an era, not the end of the world, leading to a new chapter of human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:27">[02:54:27]</a>.

### The Problem of Evil
God allows evil due to the gift of [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | free will]] given to humans and angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:29">[03:08:29]</a>. While God does not cause evil, He permits it as a risk of true freedom and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:15">[03:08:15]</a>. However, God is actively defeating evil, and its days are numbered; it is a process that will culminate in a definitive end to evil and suffering, leading to "new heavens and new earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:32">[03:09:32]</a>.

## Practical Advice and Hope
Father Duarte emphasizes preparedness and spiritual resilience:
-   **Spiritual Preparation**: Live a life of [[spiritual_teachings_and_beliefs | holiness]], pray seriously, and surrender to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:57">[03:11:57]</a>.
-   **Material Preparation**: For those who can, having some material preparation, like a small farm with chickens, can provide a "plan B" to survive outside the system when faced with coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>. Being in a small, supportive community with shared resources is also beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:18">[02:34:18]</a>.
-   **Maintain Physical Health**: Care for one's mental and physical health through proper nutrition, rest, and temperance, as it supports the ability to love God and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:25">[03:00:25]</a>.
-   **Do Not Be Naive**: Christians should not be naive about the spiritual struggle and the insidious ways evil manifests in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>.
-   **Persevere in Joy**: Despite the challenges, the overall message is one of hope. God will intervene to defeat evil, and a new era of peace will come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>. Joy itself is considered "exorcistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

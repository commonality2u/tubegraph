Protestantism, a broad movement originating from the [[Historical context of the Protestant Reformation | Reformation]], has significantly shaped Western societies and cultures, including its complex relationship with Jewish communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This relationship has evolved from historical animosity to periods of mutual appreciation and cooperation, profoundly impacting both Christian and Jewish identities and societies.

## The Medieval Church and Pre-Reformation Seeds
Historically, the medieval Christian church held a largely negative and often anti-Semitic stance towards Jewish people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>. Jews were often viewed as collectively responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus, leading to centuries of persecution, discrimination, and the belief that the Gentile church had replaced the Jewish people in God's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>. During the Late Middle Ages, Europe experienced crises like the Black Death, which the church struggled to address, often blaming Jews due to misconceptions about their hygiene practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:31">[01:51:31]</a>.

However, even before the mainstream Reformation, "pre-reformers" like Peter Waldo (12th century), Jerome Savonarola (Florence), and John Wycliffe (England, 14th century) began to question the medieval church's authority and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, emphasizing the importance of direct access to [[Christian denominations and their differences | Scripture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. Wycliffe, for instance, was persecuted and burned for translating the Bible into vernacular English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. These early movements laid the groundwork for a critical re-evaluation of religious authority and practice.

## The Reformation's Emphasis on Scripture and Hebrew
The Protestant Reformation, gaining significant momentum in the 16th century, was driven by a desire to return to the "sources" (**_Ad Fontes_**), emphasizing the original biblical texts in Greek and Hebrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>. This focus inherently necessitated engagement with Jewish scholars who were the guardians of the Hebrew language and Old Testament traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:13">[02:58:13]</a>.

Martin Luther (1486-1546), a key figure in the Reformation, initially hoped that Jews would convert to his reformed faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>. However, when this did not happen, his views turned harsh, promoting anti-Semitic sentiments and advocating for the destruction of synagogues and the confinement of Jews to ghettos in his later writings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. This reflects the pervasive medieval anti-Semitism that even reformers sometimes struggled to shed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:34">[01:51:34]</a>.

Despite Luther's personal failings, the broader Reformation's commitment to *Sola Scriptura* (Scripture alone) paved a new path for Christian-Jewish relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## A New Relationship: "Older Brothers" and Dialogue
While Luther's approach was flawed, the "Reformed" branch of Protestantism, notably originating in Geneva and later spreading to Scotland (via John Knox) and the Netherlands, fostered a more appreciative view of Jewish people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

John Calvin (1509-1564), a second-generation reformer, and his successor Theodore Beza, began to see Jews as "older brothers" and "guardians of the book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. They encouraged studying Hebrew with Jewish rabbis to understand the Old Testament on its own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. This led to a genuine appreciation for Jewish culture and identity.

In England, the Puritan movement, influenced by Continental Reformed thought, actively sought to re-admit Jews who had been expelled in the 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>. Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, invited a prominent Portuguese Rabbi to plead for Jewish return, believing that bringing Jews back would bring God's blessing to England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>. This led to Jews being allowed to return to England, marking a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:07">[01:58:07]</a>.

The Netherlands, particularly Amsterdam, became a haven for Jewish refugees fleeing persecution from the Iberian Peninsula, earning it the nickname "North Jerusalem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:29">[01:58:29]</a>. This was largely due to the Calvinist Reformed ethos that promoted religious freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:03">[01:59:03]</a>.

## Protestant Support for the Return of Jews to Israel
A notable aspect of this evolving relationship was the rise of Protestant Zionism, the belief that the land of Israel belongs to the Jews perpetually based on divine promises in the Old Testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>.

From the 16th century onwards, English-speaking Protestants, particularly those influenced by Reformed and later Pietist traditions, began to advocate for the return of Jews to their ancestral land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>. By the 19th century, this evolved into direct pressure on governments, including in the United Kingdom, to encourage Jewish emigration to Palestine (then under Ottoman rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:43">[02:13:43]</a>. Figures like Robert Murray M'Cheyne and Andrew Bonar visited Palestine, famously coining the phrase "a land without a people for a people without a land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:43">[02:13:43]</a>. The establishment of the Church of Christ in Jerusalem in the 19th century further supported this, assisting Jews in their pilgrimage back to their land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:52">[02:14:52]</a>.

This support was often driven by a theological conviction that the return of Jews to Israel would precede their recognition of Jesus as the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:53">[02:13:53]</a>.

## [[Comparative religion Christianity Judaism and Catholicism | Comparing Protestantism, Judaism, and Catholicism]]
The Protestant approach to Judaism often contrasted sharply with historical Catholic doctrine. While the Catholic Church, particularly after the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), has significantly re-evaluated its stance towards Jews, abandoning notions of collective guilt and promoting interfaith dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>, this was a much later development. Historically, the Catholic Church's emphasis on tradition and its interpretation of biblical texts differed from the Protestant "Sola Scriptura" approach, which led to a different engagement with Jewish identity and texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. The Catholic Church officially recognized the State of Israel only in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>.

## Impact on Society and Freedom
Protestantism's emphasis on individual freedom, responsibility, and the direct access to God through Scripture fostered environments conducive to [[Impact of the Protestant Reformation on modern societies | societal development]] and prosperity in Protestant-majority countries like Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Anglo-Saxon nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:55">[03:09:55]</a>. This included a greater respect for religious freedom and education, as people needed to read the Bible for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:53">[05:49:53]</a>. This cultural shift, alongside a rejection of the medieval "theology of fear," contributed to greater openness and, in many cases, a more welcoming environment for Jewish communities compared to traditionally Catholic regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

## Modern Dialogue and Complexities
Today, there is an ongoing and evolving dialogue between Orthodox Jews and Christians in the West, fostering greater understanding and seeking common ground, moving beyond historical animosities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>.

Despite these advancements, it is important to acknowledge that the relationship has not been without its complexities and challenges. Different Protestant traditions and even individual reformers held diverse views on Jews. Even today, manifestations of anti-Semitism can sometimes be masked by political or theological arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:26">[01:52:26]</a>. Nevertheless, the Reformation, particularly its Reformed branch, initiated a profound and generally more positive shift in Christian-Jewish relations, laying groundwork for improved interfaith understanding.

## Protestantism in Brazil
Brazilian Protestantism, while varied, is largely a "Protestantism without Reformation" or a "diluted Protestantism" in its theological depth compared to its European and North American roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:27">[03:19:27]</a>. Early Protestantism in Brazil, including the first official Protestant worship in the Americas in Rio de Janeiro in 1557 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:18">[02:21:18]</a>, and later the Dutch presence, faced significant limitations and discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:50">[02:23:50]</a>. Despite challenges, it became an agent of social transformation, emphasizing education and personal discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:16">[02:47:16]</a>.

While Brazil did not see the same direct historical interplay between Protestantism and Jewish communities as in Europe, the broader Protestant emphasis on individual freedom and responsibility has had a significant impact on Brazilian society, contributing to changes similar to those observed globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:16">[02:47:16]</a>.

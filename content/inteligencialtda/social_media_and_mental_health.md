Social media and digital platforms have a profound impact on [[emotional_intelligence_and_mental_health | mental health]], leading to both challenges and new insights into human behavior.

## The Impact of Digital Behavior
The pervasive nature of filming everything instead of genuinely experiencing life contributes to a rise in [[mental_health_and_disorders | depression]] among young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. Social media is often described as "very fake," presenting a distorted reality of constant joy and good things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:03">[02:54:03]</a>. This manufactured happiness can lead to a state of disunity and contribute to rising levels of sadness, melancholy, and [[mental_health_and_disorders | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:23]">[02:29:23]</a>.

### Suicide and Social Media
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared 2018 as the year of suicide prevention due to a "suicide pandemic" where a person died by suicide every 40 seconds globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:51]">[02:28:51]</a>. This tragic statistic suggests that current ways of living, or failing to experience life fully, are fostering circuits of sadness, melancholy, and [[mental_health_and_disorders | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:23]">[02:29:23]</a>.

Some social media platforms have rules against publishing content related to suicide, believing that direct mentions may be harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:57]">[02:13:57]</a>. However, it's argued that avoiding the topic prevents open discussion on how to address it constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:06]">[02:14:06]</a>. Suicide is seen as an unnatural act for human beings, occurring when despair blinds the survival instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:43]">[02:14:43]</a>. Each suicide impacts at least eight other people, who may subsequently experience [[mental_health_and_disorders | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:13]">[02:17:13]</a>.

### Compulsion and Addiction
The rise of prominent YouTubers discussing their struggles highlights how success itself can make individuals victims of their own achievements and inner turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15]">[02:22:15]</a>. This aligns with the concept of compulsion, defined as seeking something enjoyable, then being unable to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:34]">[02:22:34]</a>.

The internet can exacerbate compulsive behaviors, such as the pursuit of wealth. Studies indicate that while a certain amount of money provides comfort and happiness, an excessive, indefinite increase in wealth leads to addiction and fear of losing it, rather than proportional pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:40]">[02:24:40]</a>.

### The Paradox of Choice
The overwhelming number of options available in the digital age can lead to a "brain failure." When presented with too many choices, the brain becomes overloaded, struggling to decide. This leads to a feeling of emptiness and prompts individuals to seek something from the past that once brought pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:43]">[02:27:43]</a>. This excess of choice is believed to contribute to the rise of [[mental_health_and_disorders | depression]] among young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:43]">[02:47:43]</a>.

## Social Media as a Breeding Ground for Predators
Social media platforms, often described as a "jungle," have become hunting grounds for individuals with [[emotional_intelligence_and_mental_health | psychopathic]] tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:59]">[02:57:59]</a>. These "social chameleons" are adept at researching potential victims through their online posts and presenting themselves in a way that aligns with the victim's desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:50]">[02:57:50]</a>. This makes it challenging to identify them, as they rarely appear unpleasant until the victim has already been exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:29]">[02:57:29]</a>. The inability to love and lack of empathy characteristic of [[emotional_intelligence_and_mental_health | psychopaths]] allows them to view others as mere objects for their own gain or pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:45]">[02:58:45]</a>.

### The "Deep Web" and Online Recruitment
The "deep web" is considered a territory where [[emotional_intelligence_and_mental_health | psychopaths]] may operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00]">[01:57:00]</a>. Online platforms are also used to recruit vulnerable individuals, such as shy or socially excluded children, through manipulation, inflating their self-importance and promising recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:46]">[01:56:46]</a>.

## The Role of Artificial Intelligence
Most social networks are controlled by [[the_role_of_social_media_in_political_discourse | Artificial Intelligence]] (AI), which creates "bubbles" by connecting users with others who share similar interests and views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29]">[01:08:29]</a>. This can lead to increased polarization and a "me against them" mentality, making it harder for people to engage with differing opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54]">[01:08:54]</a>. While AI aims to keep users engaged by providing content they enjoy (dopamine hits), this constant reinforcement of existing beliefs can hinder open dialogue and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44]">[01:09:44]</a>.

There is a concern that without clear rules or "humanity" in AI programming, these platforms can lead to negative outcomes, as seen in an experiment where an AI designed to create a language became "absurdly fascist" by learning from interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24]">[01:10:24]</a>. While social networks offer positive aspects like enabling people with [[mental_health_and_disorders | depression]] or [[role_of_stress_and_anxiety_in_mental_health | panic]] to find community and understanding, the prevailing trend is towards isolation within ideological bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42]">[01:11:42]</a>.

This article examines the notable criminal cases of Suzane von Richthofen and Elize Matsunaga, focusing on their backgrounds, the crimes they committed, their psychological profiles, and the public and legal reception of their actions.

## Suzane von Richthofen Case

Suzane von Richthofen's case became widely known after she was involved in the murder of her parents.

### Family and Relationships
Suzane’s parents were killed, leaving her without any family reference [02:39:46]. She was raised in a "very cold way" by her parents, who were described as distant, which also affected her brother [02:21:53]. Suzane’s mother gave her first hug to Suzane when she was 18, only after discovering her husband's betrayal, which deeply affected Suzane [02:14:05]. Suzane found hugs uncomfortable, even telling a friend that she wished the friend would "never hug me" again [02:14:54].

While in prison, Suzane met Luciana Hostel, who became her cellmate [02:53:00]. Luciana showed Suzane a photo of her brother, Rogério Olberg, whom Suzane found "very, very pretty" [02:03:03]. Suzane and Rogério began dating, and she used his address to secure her right to temporary exits from prison [01:46:00]. The [[Case studies of complex crime investigations | Albergue family]] (Rogério and his sister Josiele) welcomed Suzane, but the author of the book “[[Case studies of complex crime investigations | Suzane]]” claims their motives were financial [02:07:09]. The Albergue family later sued the author for an article in *Época* magazine that stated their family welcomed Suzane for financial reasons [02:10:10]. The lawsuit requested that the author no longer speak about them in any newspaper or magazine [02:19:17].

### The Crime and Its Aftermath
Suzane was the mastermind behind the murder of her parents, Manfred and Marisia [01:41:35]. The idea to kill her parents evolved from a thought about a future without them, initially considering scenarios like an accident or fire, before settling on shooting them [02:11:29]. She and Daniel even rehearsed, for example, by shooting a stone wrapped in a quilt to see if she could hear it from outside [02:12:51].

Suzane killed her parents in the early hours of a Thursday [02:32:33]. After the crime, she immediately went to a motel [02:02:38]. On Saturday morning, she buried her parents [02:02:46]. On Saturday afternoon, she held her 19th birthday party with a barbecue at the mansion with Daniel and Cristian [02:02:49]. The police arrived at the party to collect evidence, and Suzane, in a bikini with a cigarette and beer, guided the investigators around the house as if on a tourism tour [02:03:01]. She even pointed out the crime scene where there was blood, stating she had cleaned it [02:03:26].

### Legal Proceedings and Public Image
Suzane has been involved in several lawsuits, including against TV Globo for showing her psychological exams [01:06:06] and against the state for not protecting her as a prisoner [01:07:26]. She also sued the book about her case before its publication, arguing it would damage her image, which she claimed was "very good" [01:07:51]. She lost this case due to attempting prior censorship [01:08:06].

During interrogations and trials, Suzane has consistently shown a lack of emotion. The delegate who conducted her investigations and obtained her confession stated that he "never saw a tear of yours" [02:02:07]. Suzane was seen crying at her parents' funeral, a moment captured in a widely circulated photo [02:02:16].

### Psychological Profile
Psychological tests, specifically the Rorschach test, were administered to Suzane to assess her mental state for her semi-open prison regime [01:29:26]. The results indicated that she is manipulative, highly seductive, and possesses "camouflaged aggression" [01:29:19]. Psychologists concluded that she is manipulative, narcissistic, and self-centered, with camouflaged aggression [01:58:00]. When asked if she would commit another crime, psychologists responded that it depends on the "demands that she has" and "the pressure from the environment" [01:58:30].

During her initial psychological evaluation, Suzane expressed remorse, but her answers indicated a focus on how the crime negatively affected *her* life (e.g., "I destroyed my life," "I could have a family") rather than genuine regret for her parents' deaths [01:44:50]. Later, when she knew how she had failed the first test, she changed her answers to express regret for destroying her parents' lives [01:48:48]. However, given her previous diagnosis of being manipulative and seductive, the evaluators did not believe her [01:46:04].

Psychiatrists have not officially classified Suzane as a psychopath based on direct examinations [02:03:50]. However, some psychologists believe that her extreme level of manipulation and seduction allows her to manipulate the evaluators themselves, preventing a diagnosis of psychopathy [02:05:20].

### Prison Life and Manipulation
Suzane demonstrated her manipulative skills even in prison. She seduced a prison officer [01:37:00] and a prison director [02:50:14]. She used the director's office to create an Orkut profile, even though she was in prison [02:50:18]. She also manipulated a prosecutor by falsely claiming that a satanic prisoner was threatening to kill her, leading him to request her transfer to another prison [02:51:38]. She requested a transfer to Tremembé, where her previous cellmate was [02:52:44]. During the transfer process, she tricked the prosecutor into thinking she would "pay her debt" (give him a kiss) if he secured her transfer, but then reported him for harassment [02:55:00].

Her religious journey in prison was described as "convenient" [01:36:56]. She converted from Lutheran to fervent Catholic, then flirted with spiritualism and Candomblé, finally becoming evangelical and attempting to become a pastor [01:36:21]. This was partly due to her claim of being "haunted by the ghost of the mother inside the jail" [01:37:34].

## Elize Matsunaga Case

Elize Matsunaga gained notoriety for the murder and dismemberment of her husband, Marcos Matsunaga.

### Background and Trauma
Elize was born in Chopinzinho, Paraná [02:49:51]. At 15, she was raped by her stepfather [02:00:00]. When she told her mother, her mother slapped her and blamed her for seducing the stepfather, then sent her away [02:38:00]. This traumatic event, along with neglect from her mother, contributed to her developing a "cold personality" [02:05:00].

Elize left home at 15 with 50 reais and wandered the roads for 35 days, eventually becoming a prostitute [03:00:00]. She was later rescued by a Federal Highway Police operation to combat child prostitution [03:19:24]. Despite her background, she was intelligent and pursued various professional paths, including an accounting technical course, a nursing technician degree, and jobs in well-known hospitals [03:34:01]. She also took a sommelier course and later became a lawyer [03:44:55]. However, she continued prostitution, viewing it as a more lucrative profession than nursing [03:28:28].

### Relationship with Marcos Matsunaga
Elize met Marcos Matsunaga through prostitution, specifically on a general supporter website and a high-class escort site [03:17:00]. Marcos was a millionaire, with his mother being a partial owner of Yoki [03:52:00]. Marcos had a compulsive sexual disorder (popularly referred to as nymphomania, but psychiatrically called sexual compulsion disorder) and "shyness of love" syndrome, an excessive shyness that made it difficult for him to approach women [03:45:00]. His wealth allowed him to satisfy his sexual compulsions by hiring prostitutes [03:06:00]. He also had a fetish for convincing women to engage in anal sex, sometimes using a gun to coerce them [03:58:00].

Initially, Elize and Marcos’s relationship was passionate, as they shared common interests like hunting, weapons, and radical sports [04:40:00]. However, Marcos’s disorder caused him to lose interest quickly, and he continued to engage with other prostitutes even while married to Elize [04:54:00]. He frequently humiliated Elize, reminding her that he had "rescued her from trash" and given her a "world of princess" [04:46:00]. He accused her of being a "country girl" who didn't know English or wine, and reminded her that she was a prostitute [04:35:00]. He viewed their marriage as a "never-ending program" [02:22:00]. When Elize became pregnant and was unable to have sex due to complications, Marcos treated her like a prostitute, demanding sexual favors [04:13:00].

### The Crime and Its Uniqueness
Elize killed Marcos in an "impetus," not a planned act [04:14:00]. This was confirmed by the fact that she did not plan to kill him inside the house, nor did she consider disabling security cameras [04:18:00]. The murder was preceded by a "torrent of humiliations" [04:50:00]. The night of the crime, Marcos was verbally abusive, telling Elize he would take their daughter because her family was "trash" and she was an "old prostitute" [04:50:00]. During the argument, she found a loaded gun in a strategic drawer and shot him [04:50:00].

After the shot, Elize dragged Marcos's body 15 meters to the guest room [04:51:00]. She cleaned the scene meticulously using "Veja multipurpose" cleaner, so thoroughly that experts using luminol found no trace of blood [05:08:00]. Her actions after the murder, such as cleaning the scene, dismembering the body, and feeding her daughter, demonstrate a "cold-blooded" criminal behavior [05:40:00].

Elize dismembered Marcos’s body using a kitchen knife [05:29:00]. She used techniques learned from professional hunters for medium-sized animals, waiting about three hours for the blood to drain before cutting the body [05:57:00]. She broke dismemberment standards by cutting at the knees, separating the tibia from the femur, and making an "extraordinary" cut at the waist, leaving the head on the trunk [05:57:00]. She decided to cut off the head only because the trunk with the head would not fit into the third suitcase she was using to distribute the body parts [06:04:00]. She tried to dispose of the body parts in Curitiba but turned back due to a car licensing issue [01:13:47]. She then disposed of the body parts along a forest road near Cotia [01:27:00].

### Public Perception and Media
Elize's documentary, "Once Upon a Crime," on Netflix, was conceived by her lawyers to allow her to tell her version of events and communicate with her daughter [01:03:00]. The documentary's beginning includes a warning that it presents her version [01:11:54].

The public tends to question why victims of [[Homicide Investigation Techniques | abusive relationships]] like Elize do not simply leave. Psychologists explain that victims often have very low self-esteem, making it difficult for them to react or leave, especially if they are financially and emotionally dependent, or have children [02:26:00]. For example, Elize's biological father was extremely violent, and her mother neglected her after her stepfather raped her, leaving her with no safe place to go [02:17:00].

The author explains that exploring the universe of prostitution, as done in the book about Elize Matsunaga, is crucial to understanding the crime [02:29:00]. Prostitution is a world where women give up many things to work [02:47:00], often involving abuse and difficult choices like abortion or selling children to return to work [03:47:00]. Many luxury prostitutes, like Penelope (a character in the book), were models who turned to prostitution for survival [04:49:00]. Penelope herself had planned to commit suicide, and her diary revealed she had been abused by her father and struggled with depression [03:07:00].

### Comparison to Other Cases
The article mentions [[Notable Criminal Cases and Investigations in Brazil | Elize's case]] and [[Notable Criminal Cases and Investigations in Brazil | Suzane's case]] as being about people who committed crimes "for love or for financial reasons" [02:44:00]. Both cases involve family breakdowns [02:47:00]. The author notes that both criminals brought the "light of spotlights" upon themselves [02:04:30]. They both confessed to their crimes [01:11:00].

Unlike Suzane, Elize has two certificates of psychopathy, though two others state she is not a psychopath [02:07:42]. A psychologist who performed couples therapy with Elize and Marcos stated Elize is a psychopath because she killed and dismembered her husband over a weekend, then attended a scheduled therapy session, regretting Marcos's abandonment rather than his death [02:08:14]. Elize's behavior, like drinking coffee normally and changing bed sheets after the crime, showed no emotional shock [02:08:46].

## Criminal Investigation and Journalism
The author, a journalist, emphasizes the importance of [[Criminal investigations and procedures | understanding the motivations and backgrounds]] of criminals rather than simply focusing on the brutality of the crime [01:54:00]. He believes readers should try to understand the paths that lead someone to commit such acts [01:57:00]. He differentiates his journalistic approach from a criminologist's, such as Ilana, whose book on Suzane is more technical and based on documents, whereas his book relies on interviews and narratives [02:54:00].

The author states that while crime shocks, it often blinds people to other issues surrounding the acts [01:54:00]. He advises against judging a situation from one's own perspective [02:52:00], as these individuals were subjected to experiences that others did not endure [02:19:00]. For instance, a psychologist warned him not to be afraid of Suzane, as she killed her parents, not random people [02:29:00].

The author argues against procedural secrecy in cases that have shocked the nation, believing the public has a right to know about the execution of sentences and the potential for criminals to re-offend [01:38:00]. He states that psychopathic individuals are cold and unable to empathize [02:44:00].

The author acknowledges the emotional toll of writing about such macabre subjects, experiencing nightmares from his research on Elize Matsunaga, but he channeled these feelings into his narrative [02:26:00]. He maintains a professional distance, similar to a doctor in a children's ICU, to prevent suffering alongside the subjects [02:30:00].

The author has written a trilogy of books: "[[Case studies of complex crime investigations | Suzane]]", "[[Case studies of complex crime investigations | Elize]]", and an upcoming book on Flordelis [03:00:00]. He also co-manages an Instagram account, @mulheresassassinas (Killer Women), which provides extra material and photos related to the cases [03:00:00].

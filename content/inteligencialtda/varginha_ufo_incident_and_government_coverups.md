The [[varginha_incident | Varginha incident]] is a notable case in [[ufos_in_brazilian_history | Brazilian UFO history]], characterized by alleged [[extraterrestrial_life_and_ufo_sightings | extraterrestrial life]] sightings and a significant government cover-up. It has been described as a "real X-Files" event due to the military involvement and subsequent denials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:08">[04:41:08]</a>.

## The Incident and Creatures

The incident involved the capture of [[extraterrestrial_life_and_ufo_sightings | creatures]] in Varginha, Minas Gerais. One particular creature, described as a "Gamma" type, had a large head with lumps, red eyes, no thumbs, three fingers on its hands, and two toes, resembling a fat cigar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:13">[04:12:13]</a>. It was dark brown and approximately 1.60m tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:11">[04:36:11]</a>.

### Capture and Transportation
The creatures were captured in late January 1996, specifically between January 23rd and 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:15">[04:41:15]</a>. They were taken to the EVA installation of the Army, and from there, both live and dead creatures were transported by train to Unicamp University, involving 22 people working with Badam Palhares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:15">[04:41:15]</a>. Military personnel participated in this convoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:46">[04:43:46]</a>. One of the creatures reportedly remained in Brazil, taken to Iperó, a base of the Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:55">[04:54:55]</a>.

### The Death of PM Marco Eli Chereze
A military police officer, Marco Eli Chereze, reportedly died after capturing one of the [[extraterrestrial_life_and_ufo_sightings | ETs]] with his bare hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:10">[04:11:10]</a>. He sustained a scratch under his armpit and subsequently developed an infection, leading to his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:10">[04:11:10]</a>.

## The Investigation and Cover-up

The [[varginha_incident | Varginha incident]] involved a military cover-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:08">[04:41:08]</a>. The case was classified as top secret, or even above that, making it difficult to access official documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:35">[04:37:35]</a>. The motivation for such secrecy is believed to be panic among the population and military interest in the technology of the objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:58">[04:59:58]</a>.

### The "Group of Seven" Researchers
A "group of seven" researchers, including Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues, Vitório Pacaccini, Claudeir Covo, Edson Boaventura, Jamil Vila Nova, and twin brothers Eduardo and Osvaldo Mondini, investigated the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:13">[04:39:13]</a>. This group had unrestricted access to materials and testimonies from military, police, fire department, and civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:46">[04:42:46]</a>.

### Official Denials and Intimidation
Authorities, including the military, police, fire department, and hospital staff, denied the events, often due to intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:02">[04:50:02]</a>.
Nurses who saw the creature later denied it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:55">[04:44:55]</a>. The Army called a press conference to deny everything, claiming no soldiers or ESA resources were used in the capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:02">[04:45:02]</a>. To discredit witnesses, the Army attempted to attribute the sightings to a local man with mental problems who was mute, despite the girls knowing he was elsewhere during the sighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:06">[04:55:06]</a>.

### Men in Black and Bribery Attempts
Witnesses, including Dona Luiza and her daughters Liliane and Valquíria, reported visits from "men in black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:50">[04:49:50]</a>. These men offered money and an opportunity for the girls to realize their dreams if they denied their sighting publicly on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:22">[04:51:22]</a>. The family, prioritizing truth, rejected the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:46">[04:52:46]</a>. The "group of seven" researchers publicized this bribery attempt to the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:57">[04:53:57]</a>. These "men in black" could be government agents or even [[extraterrestrial_life_and_ufo_sightings | extraterrestrial]] beings in disguise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:02">[04:58:02]</a>.

### Threats to Researchers
Researchers involved in the [[varginha_incident | Varginha case]] faced significant threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:07">[04:56:07]</a>. Edson Boaventura received threats via phone, with callers mentioning his son's school address, warning him to stop speaking or an "accident could happen to him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:07">[04:56:07]</a>. Vitório Pacaccini received over 15 threats in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:25">[04:56:25]</a>. Both Pacaccini and Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues were interrogated for over four hours at the sergeant's school, leading to a significant reduction in public engagement from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:33">[04:56:33]</a>. The Mondini brothers were also threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:15">[04:57:15]</a>.

## Parallels with Roswell

The [[varginha_incident | Varginha incident]] has similarities to the [[historical_ufo_cases | Roswell incident]] in the US, where an object crashed in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. In both cases, initial military reports confirmed a "flying saucer" capture, only to be later retracted and explained as a weather balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. The materials found in Roswell were described as nanotechnology, capable of returning to their original form after being crumpled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. While Roswell information was suppressed for 30 years due to military patriotism, Varginha's details emerged within three months, indicating a more open information flow in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.

## Cultural Impact

The [[varginha_incident | Varginha incident]] even inspired a DVD game, with its cover designed by Edson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. A water tank in Varginha is shaped like an [[extraterrestrial_life_and_ufo_sightings | alien]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:50">[04:06:50]</a>.

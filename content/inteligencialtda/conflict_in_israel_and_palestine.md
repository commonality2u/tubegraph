The [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | ongoing war in Israel]] is viewed as a significant event, with its rapid escalation being particularly notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Eschatological Interpretations
From an eschatological perspective, the [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | conflict in Israel]] is considered "alarming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This interpretation suggests that for the government of the antichrist to establish itself, a Third World War would be necessary, and this war is predicted to occur between [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel and the Palestinians]], or [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Arabs]] in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Albert Pike's Prophecy
Insights from an ex-Satanist named Doc Marx, who wrote "The Secret of Illuminates," suggest a long-term plan for a new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. According to this view, Albert Pike, a "pope of Freemasonry," had a vision in 1870 detailing how the new world order would be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This plan requires centuries of work and involves individuals across all societal sectors, including the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. The ultimate goal is for the world to collapse, allowing the antichrist to emerge as a global problem-solver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

This theory predicts three world wars for the establishment of the new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **First World War**: Aimed to overthrow the Russian Tsarist government, which opposed a Central Bank, and establish a militaristic, atheist, communist nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Vladimir Lenin received financial support from the world's banking elite for the communist revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Second World War**: Objective was to strengthen the communist nation into a superpower to destroy other nations and religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This is seen as fulfilled in the Soviet Union's persecution of religions and control over Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Thesis vs. Antithesis**: The first two world wars created a global "thesis vs. antithesis" scenario: capitalism versus communism, leading to the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This division, which continues today as political extremism, is believed to keep people distracted from the larger plan for a new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### The Predicted Third World War
The third world war, according to Doc Marx and Albert Pike's vision, would begin between [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Jews and Arabs]], or [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Jews and Islam]]/[[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Muslims]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This prediction, made in 1870 when [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] was not yet a state, is viewed as astonishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. From the chaos of this war, a "super man" or leader would emerge, offering economic and social solutions to bring peace and end the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. The current events in [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] are seen as "drawing the scenery on the horizon" for this prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

## Current Conflict and its Roots
The speaker describes the recent [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | attacks on Israel]] as horrifying, citing acts of [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] such as kidnapping and killing civilians, beheading babies, molesting children, and raping women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This aggression made it "impossible" for [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] not to respond, aiming to recover civilians, destroy [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]], and prevent a peace agreement between [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

### The Role of Iran
Extremist groups do not desire peace; they seek to destroy [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. The speaker highlights [[Iran's and its influence | Iran's]] significant role in financing these terrorist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. The concern is that if [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] attacks [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]], [[Iran's and its influence | Iran]] could enter the war, which would then draw in the United States, and potentially Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This chain reaction could trigger a world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

### Spiritual War and Islamic Extremism
The [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | current conflict]] is also seen as a spiritual war, rooted in religious reasons, specifically between [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Jews and fundamentalist Islam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. It's clarified that not all Islamic countries are Arab (e.g., [[Iran's and its influence | Iran]] is Persian, Egypt was not originally Arab), and not all Muslims are radical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Research suggests only 15-20% of Muslims are extremists, but this still amounts to approximately 320 million people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

Islam is noted as the fastest-growing religion due to high fertility rates and immigration, particularly in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. Radical Islam believes Islam should be the world's only religion, viewing followers of other faiths as "infidels," leading to severe persecution of Christians and Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

### The Root of Intolerance: House of Islam vs. House of Sword
The deep-seated intolerance towards [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] stems from a systematic theology developed by Islamic fundamentalist leader Alm Vard around 1000 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   **Dar al-Islam (House of Islam)**: Lands ruled by Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.
*   **Dar al-Harb (House of Sword)**: Territories not ruled by Islam, which are meant to be conquered through jihad (holy war) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.

Based on this, extremists never accepted the State of Israel because that land was once under Islamic rule (since 638 AD) and, in their view, can never again be governed by non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. This explains why they oppose a two-state solution, as their goal is the "extermination of [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]]" and its erasure from the map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

Historically, Arab leaders have consistently voiced the goal of [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel's]] extermination, even immediately after its founding in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## Whose Land Is It?
The question of who has the right to the land is a central point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[03:00:22]</a>.

### Biblical and Historical Claims
*   **God's Promise to Abraham**: God chose Abraham around 2000 BC and promised him the land of Canaan (present-day [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Palestine]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. Abraham's descendants, through Isaac and Jacob, formed the 12 tribes of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
*   **Exodus and Conquest**: After 400 years of slavery in Egypt, God raised Moses to lead the Israelites back to the Promised Land, described as "a good land, wide, flowing with milk and honey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Joshua, Moses' successor, led the conquest of this land, destroying seven nations (Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, etc.) that inhabited it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.
*   **Jerusalem and Temples**: King David founded Jerusalem around 1000 BC and made it the indivisible capital of [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. Solomon built the First Temple on the site where the Dome of the Rock now stands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. This temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. The Second Temple was built after the Babylonian captivity and was improved by King Herod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>.
*   **Roman Persecution and Diaspora**: In 70 AD, Romans destroyed the Second Temple and killed 1 million Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Many survivors became slaves, used to build the Colosseum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. In 132 AD, another Jewish revolt against Emperor Hadrian led to the destruction of 980 Jewish villages and the death of nearly 600,000 Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. Hadrian then banned Jews from entering Jerusalem and prohibited Jewish practices, leading to the diaspora where Jews spread across the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Islamic and Ottoman Rule**: From 638 AD, Islam conquered Jerusalem, establishing its dominion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. From 1517 to 1918, [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Palestine]] was Ottoman Turkish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.
*   **Modern State of Israel**: After WWI, the British won control, and in 1921, divided [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Palestine]] into Transjordan (for Arabs) and Western [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Palestine]] (for Jews) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>. Jewish immigration, including Russian Jews establishing kibbutzim (socialist communities), began in 1882 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>. In 1948, with the UN resolution and Brazil's decisive vote, [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] became a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>.
*   **Palestinians' Rights**: Palestinians have a right to a state, and a two-state solution has been proposed, but not accepted by extremist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>. While the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank seeks a state, [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] in Gaza aims for the "extermination of the Jewish people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>.

### The Gaza Strip
From 1948 to 1967, the Gaza Strip belonged to Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] took control of Gaza during the Six-Day War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. In 2005, [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] removed its Jewish residents from Gaza in an attempt to achieve peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] won elections in Gaza in 2006 and has since used the territory to attack [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

## Global Reactions and Narratives
Public opinion worldwide is polarized, with demonstrations for both [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Palestine]] and [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. The far-left is generally aligned with [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Palestine]] and [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]], while right-wing or capitalist countries tend to align with [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

There is a "war of narratives" where media attempts to guide public opinion against [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:31">[02:03:31]</a>. For example, accusations against [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] of bombing a hospital that was actually a parking lot are part of this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>. The speaker stresses that [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] has never started a war but has always defended itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>.

## Prophecies and the Future
The prophecy of Gog and Magog in Ezekiel describes an alliance of northern peoples (Russia) with Persia (Iran) and other nations (Libya, North Africa, and even Europe) against [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:05">[01:41:05]</a>. This prophecy, written 600 years before Jesus, suggests that God will intervene, causing the coalition to fight among themselves and sending plagues and natural disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>. This event is seen as another way for God to reveal himself to nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:28">[01:44:28]</a>.

### The Antichrist's Role
Eschatologically, the solution to the [[The Israel Hamas conflict and its implications | current conflict]] will come from the antichrist, who will emerge during a global war and mediate a peace agreement between [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] and the [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Arabs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. He is expected to be Jewish and will be initially accepted by [[Israel and Palestine conflict history | Israel]] as the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>.

### The Illuminati and Edomites
The Illuminati, founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1770, are linked to earlier movements like Sabbateanism (founded by Sabbatai Zevi in 1626) and Frankism (founded by Jacob Frank in 1770) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:11">[02:54:11]</a>. These groups secretly rejected Jewish law and morals, believing Lucifer was good and God was evil, permitting all biblical sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>. The Illuminati believe Sabbatai Zevi's soul transmigrated to a dynasty of 13 families who control the world system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:06">[02:57:06]</a>.

One theory connects these controlling families, such as the Rothschilds (whose name means "red shield"), to the descendants of Esau (Edom), who were called "red" and became camouflaged within the Jewish people through forced conversion to Judaism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:16">[02:59:16]</a>. These "false Jews" or Edomites, as referenced in Revelation 2:9 and 3:9, would control global finance, media, education, and entertainment to shape world thinking toward a New World Order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:37">[02:59:37]</a>. Jeremiah 11:9 speaks of a "conspiracy... found among the men of Judah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:24">[03:00:24]</a>.

> [!quote] Revelation 2:9 (paraphrased)
> "I know... the blasphemy of those who declare themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:33">[02:53:33]</a>

### The UN and Global Governance
The UN, created after WWII to prevent conflicts, has expanded its influence to all areas of society, even dictating national policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:35">[03:33:35]</a>. This is interpreted as the UN positioning itself to become the unified world government in the lead-up to the new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>.

### Approaching Eschatological Events
The speaker concludes that humanity may be on the verge of these eschatological events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:02">[03:05:02]</a>. Catastrophes like earthquakes, hurricanes, nuclear war, famine, and pandemics are predicted to occur simultaneously with the beginning of the Third World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. These "programmed" disasters are believed to be manipulated using technology to control weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>. All events preceding the Rapture are believed to be fulfilled, meaning Jesus could return at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>.

Time, fundamentally, serves as a human construct to quantify and order the continuous processes observed in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. While physical phenomena occur independently, humanity has developed various conventions to understand and interact with the passage of [[Nature and understanding of time | time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

## Early Timekeeping

Ancient philosophers, without modern scientific tools, began to define time by observing natural cycles, such as the shifting sun from day to night and the changing phases of the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. These observations were critical for establishing daily routines, managing agriculture, and understanding seasonal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

One of the earliest known human measurements of time dates back approximately 30,000 years, involving the marking of moon phases on a bone, which is now housed in the Natural History Museum of London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This reliance on the moon was due to its easily observable changes, unlike the more consistent appearance of the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

Stars and constellations were also vital for ancient timekeeping. The Egyptians, for instance, used constellations like Orion to predict optimal times for planting in the Nile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. Much of this ancient knowledge, particularly from regions like Mesopotamia, was unfortunately lost due to events such as fires at grand libraries, notably the Library of Alexandria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

## Calendars

Different cultures developed their own calendar systems. The Chinese calendar, based on lunar cycles, is considered very effective, beginning each year with the first new moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

The Gregorian calendar, widely used today, is relatively recent and has a complex history of adjustments. Its irregularities, such as July and August both having 31 days due to tributes to Julius and Augustus Caesar, led to the shortening of February and the need for leap years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. This calendar's start date is also a convention, diverging from astronomically significant points like the winter solstice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

## Units of Time

The division of a day into 24 hours and hours into 60 minutes likely originated from the use of sundials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Sundials, which measure time by casting shadows, enabled ancient civilizations to divide the day into equal intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. Many historical monuments, such as the large sundial at Ibirapuera Park in Brazil, served as public timekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.

The modern definition of a second is based on the decay time of the Cesium-133 atom, specifically 9 billion vibrations of this isotope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. More recently, the second has also been defined by the distance light travels in a given period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. The achievement of measuring such minute intervals, like the zeptosecond, often leads to Nobel Prizes, rewarding both theoretical prediction and [[Technological advances in timerelated research | technological advances]] in measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:31">[02:50:31]</a>.

## Tools for Measurement

Beyond sundials, other instruments were developed for more precise timekeeping:
*   **Human Hand**: Ancient observers used their hand span to estimate time passages in the sky, for instance, estimating an hour by holding their thumb and index finger outstretched to the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
*   **Astrolabes**: These instruments measured angles in the sky, allowing astronomers like Tycho Brahe to precisely record star positions. His extensive catalog of data later enabled Kepler to discover his laws of planetary motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.
*   **Sextants**: Used in navigation, similar to astrolabes, for measuring celestial positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>.
*   **Knots**: Originally, ship speed was measured by counting knots in a rope dropped into the water over a specific time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
*   **Hourglasses**: Used for measuring shorter, specific periods of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

## Time as an Abstract Concept

Time is often described as an abstract concept due to its intangible nature. Unlike physical objects, it cannot be held or directly exchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>. The movie "In Time" famously illustrates this by depicting a society where time is a currency, literally paid for and transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.

From a physical perspective, time is considered a "fundamental magnitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. It is an inherent part of our four-dimensional universe, often referred to as space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:08">[03:03:08]</a>. Hermann Minkowski was instrumental in defining this concept of space-time as a unified entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

## [[Time perception and relativistic effects | Time Perception and Relativistic Effects]]

[[Time perception and relativistic effects | Time]] is not uniform across the universe; its passage depends on various physical parameters, including speed and gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

*   **Speed (Special Relativity)**: Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity states that time passes differently for objects moving at different speeds. The faster an object approaches the speed of light, the slower time passes for that object relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is observable in particle accelerators, where accelerated particles exhibit slower decay times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>. For example, a spacecraft traveling at 90% the speed of light to Alpha Centauri (4.2 light-years away) would experience a journey of only two months for its occupants, while 4.2 years would pass on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>. This is known as the concept of "reference frames," where motion and rest are relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.
*   **Gravity (General Relativity)**: Einstein's theory of general relativity demonstrates that gravity also influences the passage of time. The stronger the gravitational field, the slower time passes. This effect is dramatically illustrated by black holes, where time near the event horizon can appear to stop for a distant observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>. The film "Interstellar" vividly portrays this with Miller's planet, where hours spent near a black hole translate to decades on the distant mothership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. This principle is crucial for modern technologies like GPS satellites, which require relativistic corrections to maintain accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

## [[Time travel theories and paradoxes | Time Travel Theories and Paradoxes]]

*   **Travel to the Future**: Physics affirms that [[Time travel theories and paradoxes | travel to the future]] is possible due to the effects of speed and gravity on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. Real-world examples include astronauts like Scott Kelly, who aged slightly less than his twin brother on Earth after spending time on the International Space Station at high speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a>.
*   **Travel to the Past**: The possibility of [[Time travel theories and paradoxes | travel to the past]] is largely constrained by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which dictates the increase of entropy (disorder) in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:52">[01:53:52]</a>. This law implies that processes are generally irreversible; a broken glass cannot spontaneously reassemble, nor can an omelet revert to an egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09">[01:36:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. While local entropy can decrease (e.g., a caterpillar becoming a butterfly), the overall entropy of the universe always increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>.
*   **Theoretical Frameworks**:
    *   **GÃ¶del Universe**: A theoretical solution to Einstein's equations suggests a universe in rotation where time could be cyclical, allowing for a return to the same point in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>. However, this theory presents causality problems related to entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:33">[02:43:33]</a>.
    *   **Block Universe**: A philosophical theory positing that all of timeâpast, present, and futureâexists simultaneously as a single block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. This concept suggests that the future is already "done," with only small disruptions potentially creating different future branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.
    *   **Wormholes**: Predicted by general relativity, wormholes (or Einstein-Rosen bridges) are theoretical tunnels through space-time that could connect distant points in space and potentially time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:21">[02:09:21]</a>. Their existence would require "exotic matter" with negative mass, which has not been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>. Even if traversable, travel through a wormhole would not allow a return to a point *before* one's departure to avoid violating thermodynamic laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>.

*   **[[Time travel theories and paradoxes | Time Travel Paradoxes]]**:
    *   **Bootstrap Paradox**: This paradox involves information or an object existing without an original source, such as a time machine's blueprint given to its inventor from the future, or a book whose author receives the finished work from a future traveler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:29">[01:46:29]</a>. It challenges the consistency of time travel to the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.
    *   **Grandfather Paradox**: This well-known paradox asks what would happen if someone traveled back in time and killed their own grandfather before their parents were born, thus preventing their own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:24">[01:47:24]</a>.
    *   **Principle of Self-Consistency**: Many narratives, like "Interstellar" and "Harry Potter," resolve paradoxes by suggesting that any [[Time travel theories and paradoxes | time travel to the past]] would only serve to fulfill events as they already happened, ensuring that history remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Butterfly Effect**: Originating from Ray Bradbury's story "A Sound of Thunder," this concept illustrates how even a tiny change in the past (like stepping on a butterfly) could lead to vastly different futures, due to [[Nature and understanding of time | chaos theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:06">[01:53:06]</a>.
    *   **Twin Paradox**: This is not a true paradox in physics but a verifiable phenomenon of special relativity. One twin travels at near light speed and returns to find their Earth-bound twin significantly older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>. This has been experimentally demonstrated with astronauts like Scott Kelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a>.

Stephen Hawking famously attempted to debunk the possibility of [[Time travel theories and paradoxes | time travel to the past]] by hosting a party for time travelers and only publishing the invitation after the event, observing that no one from the future attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:23">[01:59:23]</a>.

Time zones, while creating apparent "time travel" (e.g., being in the "future" in Australia), are merely human conventions for managing daily life across a rotating globe and do not involve actual travel through time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:58">[02:48:58]</a>.

## Universe and Time

The universe's origin with the Big Bang implies that space-time itself was created then, rendering the question of "before" meaningless within that framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>.

The cosmological principle states that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous on large scales, meaning it looks the same in every direction and at every location, without a discernible center of expansion. This can be visualized as a swelling sponge, where galaxies move away from each other without a specific central point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:41">[02:30:41]</a>.

The ultimate fate of the universe is theorized to have four main hypotheses:
*   **Big Freeze (Heat Death)**: Expansion continues until it freezes and all energy dissipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:16">[02:58:16]</a>.
*   **Big Rip**: Expansion accelerates to the point where all matter, down to subatomic particles, is torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:24">[02:58:24]</a>.
*   **Big Crunch**: The universe's expansion reverses, leading to a contraction back into a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:40">[02:58:40]</a>.
*   **Big Bounce**: A cyclical model where the universe repeatedly expands and contracts, never truly beginning or ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:47">[02:58:47]</a>.

These hypotheses depend on factors like dark energy and the universe's topology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:56">[02:58:56]</a>.

Understanding time remains one of the most profound challenges in physics, with ongoing efforts to unify gravitational theory with quantum mechanics to fully grasp its nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:24">[02:38:24]</a>.

During his presidency, Jair Bolsonaro's term (2019-2022) was marked by a series of implemented policies and notable controversies. His administration focused on economic deregulation, infrastructure development, and conservative social agendas, while facing significant challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and accusations of corruption and misinformation.

## Path to the Presidency
Jair Bolsonaro's political career began after 15 years in the Brazilian Army, where he fell in love with the military after seeing uniformed people in his city in 1970 when he was 15 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. He pursued a career as a military officer, achieving the rank of Colonel, which is practically guaranteed for academy graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, although he eventually left the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

His entry into politics was unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, triggered by an article he wrote for *Veja* magazine in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. As an active military man, he paid a price for making a press declaration, which was against military rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. This incident led to his appearance in public and a burgeoning interest in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. He ran for city councilor in 1988, winning the most votes in his party (PDC - Democratic Christian Party) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. Two years later, he launched himself as a federal deputy, serving seven consecutive terms for 28 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

In 2014, when Dilma Rousseff was re-elected, Bolsonaro decided to try something beyond his comfortable position as a federal deputy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>. He began traveling across Brazil, identifying problems and solutions, and walking alone, talking to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>. By 2016, more people started waiting for him at airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:59">[03:19:59]</a>. His campaign grew significantly in 2018, with thousands of people waiting for him at airports for rallies, though the press did not report on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:59">[03:19:59]</a>. His election budget in 2018 was R$ 2.4 million, considered small compared to what many deputies received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:50">[04:52:50]</a>.

## Policies and Reforms (2019-2022)

### Economic and Administrative Policies
Upon taking office, Bolsonaro formed a "technical ministry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:50">[04:54:50]</a>.
*   **Economic Freedom Law**: This law significantly de-bureaucratized and unregulated many processes, reducing the need for numerous stamps and authorizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>. For instance, if a city hall doesn't respond to a business permit request (e.g., for a beauty salon, workshop, or pizzeria) within 30 days, the business can open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Standards**: The administration reduced regulatory standards by 90%, alleviating pressure on businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. Inspectors became more focused on essential monitoring rather than imposing excessive fines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>.
*   **Public Service**: The government practically stopped opening competitions for public servants, aiming to "deflate" the "bloated" state machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:51">[05:51:51]</a>. Competitions were only opened for essential areas like federal police and highway police, filling positions left by retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:51">[05:51:51]</a>.
*   **Fuel Price Reduction**: The reduction in fuel prices was achieved by cutting taxes, not through direct interference with Petrobras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Federal taxes on gasoline were zeroed, and states also complained about revenue loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:57">[05:59:57]</a>.

### Infrastructure and Energy
The "technical ministry" focused on applying limited resources to bottlenecks on highways, completing unfinished kilometers, and building bridges to eliminate ferries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.
*   **Highway Development**: An example given was the BR-13, where 50 km were paved in six months with an army engineering battalion, reducing transport costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.
*   **Concessions**: The government effectively conducted airport and port concessions, aligning with its policy to reduce the state's bloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.
*   **Energy Initiatives**:
    *   **Wind Power (Offshore)**: An ordinance was published to regulate offshore wind power installations, particularly on the Northeast coast, which has the potential to generate energy equivalent to 50 Itaipus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:55">[05:54:55]</a>.
    *   **Nuclear Energy**: Construction of Angra 3 in Rio de Janeiro, stalled for over 10 years, was set to resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
    *   **Lithium Exploration**: A decree allowed for the exploration of lithium in the Jequitinhonha Valley, Minas Gerais, a region rich in the mineral, aiming for self-sufficiency in battery production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

### Agricultural Policies
*   **Fertilizers**: Brazil sought to overcome its dependence on imported fertilizers, particularly from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. Bolsonaro's trip to Russia in February was aimed at negotiating fertilizer supply, preventing a fall in productivity and ensuring food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Indigenous Lands**: A bill was introduced to allow indigenous people, upon their free and spontaneous agreement, to explore their lands, enabling them to farm like other farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Family Farming & Land Titling**: The government titled 420,000 land possessions (poceiros), providing documentation that allows families to seek financing and be more motivated to work their land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. This policy also significantly reduced land invasions by the MST (Landless Workers' Movement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Fish Farming**: Negotiations with the Paraguayan Parliament aimed to increase fish production by 40% through fish farming in Lake Itaipu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. Federal taxes on fish feed would be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

### Privatizations and Concessions
Bolsonaro stated he changed his view from statist to pro-privatization, realizing that a "bloated state does not work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:27">[02:57:27]</a>.
*   **Eletrobras**: The energy company Eletrobras was privatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:27">[02:57:27]</a>.
*   **Post Office**: The privatization of the Post Office was in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:27">[02:57:27]</a>.
*   **TV Brasil**: The official TV Brasil, which previously had political uses, was "sanitized" with more educational programs and reduced staff, becoming the fifth most viewed TV channel in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:27">[02:57:27]</a>.
*   **Highways**: New highway concessions were implemented, resulting in lower toll prices (e.g., BR-116/Dutra Highway, with a 20% average reduction and zero toll for motorcycles) and guaranteed duplications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:27">[02:57:27]</a>.

## Controversies and Challenges

### COVID-19 Pandemic Response
Bolsonaro identified the pandemic as the most difficult moment of his life, even more so than being stabbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He emphasized the lack of a proven antidote or scientific evidence for medicines, and the "absurd pressure" on doctors from state authorities to prevent administering certain treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Lockdown Policy**: Bolsonaro stated he was always against closing businesses and schools, advocating for elderly people and those with comorbidities to isolate while others worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He asserted that a policy of not working would lead to more deaths from depression and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Vaccines**: He claimed his government was unfairly criticized for not buying vaccines in 2020, stating no country had vaccines for sale then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He criticized Pfizer's contract proposal for not guaranteeing delivery dates or responsibility for side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He referenced a controversial statement about turning into an alligator as a "figure of speech" misinterpreted by the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He also questioned the efficacy of vaccines in preventing transmission and stated that children 5-11 years old might experience chest pain, lack of air, or palpitations after vaccination, citing Anvisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Wuhan/Doria Vaccine**: Bolsonaro asserted that the federal government was responsible for purchasing all vaccines, including the one promoted by Doria, which he claimed was a "poster boy" for political gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Censorship of Discussion**: He highlighted that discussion on topics like the origin of the virus (laboratory vs. animal) or potential COVID-19 treatments was forbidden and led to persecution of those who spoke out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

### [[political_corruption_in_brazil | Political Corruption]] and the "Secret Budget"
Bolsonaro frequently criticized the corruption of previous PT governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>. He cited the *mensalão* and *petrolão* scandals, claiming that R$6 billion were returned by whistleblowers and R$16 billion by companies through leniency agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>. He specifically mentioned pension funds (Petrobras, Caixa Econômica, Post Office) where R$45 billion were allegedly diverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>. He also referenced the "More Doctors" program with Cuba, where 9,500 of the 12,000 monthly income went to Fidel Castro, totaling over R$1 billion per year for the Cuban dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

*   **"Secret Budget"**: Bolsonaro explained that this budget was created by Parliament in his second year (2020) by overturning his veto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. It refers to an "amendment rapporteur" quota of approximately R$15 billion per year for the Chamber and Senate, in addition to the R$15 million each parliamentarian already receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. The "secret" aspect comes from the fact that the rapporteur (a deputy or senator) allocates these funds to municipalities or states without naming the parliamentarian who requested them, thus making it seem like the president is buying votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. He asserted that if he were buying votes, he wouldn't allocate funds to PT deputies, 13 of whom were found to have received funds from this budget despite never voting with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>.

### Fake News and Censorship
Bolsonaro expressed concern about censorship and the actions of the TSE (Superior Electoral Court), which he views as dangerous to freedom of expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>.
*   **Media Bias**: He claimed that traditional media (e.g., major newspapers and television) lost credibility because they took political sides and only presented negative news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>.
*   **Jovem Pan Incident**: He commented on the censorship of Jovem Pan, stating it was "absurd" and a step towards a "dictatorial state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He believes that the current censorship is worse than what existed during the military period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Accusations**: He mentioned being accused of being a "cannibal" and other "nonsense," which he states are baseless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He argued that lies affect elections because there isn't enough time for corrections to have the same impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Relationship with Sérgio Moro
Bolsonaro stated that he and Sérgio Moro (his former Justice Minister) had differences, but they resolved them and put them aside for the "common good," understanding that Lula's potential return to power would be the worst outcome for both of them and for Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Moro would have an independent performance in the Senate, focusing on fighting corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

### Controversial Comments and Accusations
*   **"Chick Climate"**: He addressed the controversy surrounding his comments about girls in a Venezuelan community, clarifying that he visited a community where he saw girls getting ready for an event. He noted that their situation was difficult, with many parents risking their lives to come to Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. He used the term "chick climate" in the context of approving the revocation of an environmental decree during a live broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **"Cannibal" Comment**: Bolsonaro explained that this accusation stemmed from a 30-year-old event in an indigenous reserve where he was told about a ritual where young deceased Indians were cooked and eaten by the village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. He said he stated he would go if everyone else did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Purchases and "Rachadinha"**: He defended his family's real estate purchases, stating they were accumulated over 32 years, starting from his first property purchase in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He refuted accusations of buying properties with "cash," clarifying that transaction records show "current currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He also countered the "rachadinha" (kickback scheme) accusations by mentioning the "More Doctors" program and stating his son Flávio is responsible for his own actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Attacks on PT Policies**: Bolsonaro attacked the PT for attempting to lower the age of statutory rape to 12 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:30">[02:20:30]</a>. He also mentioned a PT website ("humanize networks") that suggested taking child sex offenders to hospitals rather than police stations due to potential "disorder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:30">[02:20:30]</a>. He referenced a PT deputy's project that would allow children to change sex regardless of parental consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:30">[02:20:30]</a>.

### Social and Cultural Issues
*   **Abortion and Drugs**: Bolsonaro highlighted the contrast between his and Lula's stances on abortion and drug legalization, stating Lula is now changing his position to appeal to evangelicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>. He stated that the legalization of abortion could occur via the Supreme Federal Court, as a majority of its members might be favorable, especially if Lula were to appoint new ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:34">[02:11:34]</a>.
*   **Gender Ideology**: He criticized the concept of "gender ideology" being taught to children, questioning why it's necessary to discuss gender identity at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:34">[02:11:34]</a>. He also noted that Lula's 2009 National Human Rights Plan (PNDH3) included 180 chapters focused on gender ideology issues, such as unisex bathrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:34">[02:11:34]</a>.
*   **Religious Freedom**: He expressed concern that a Lula government might follow the example of other Latin American countries that persecute Christians and evangelicals, such as Nicaragua, which banned Bible Day and arrested priests, and Colombia, which proposed taxing churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

### Political and Personal Accusations
*   **Censorship of Opponents**: He accused the left of trying to destroy opponents rather than engage in critical discussion, and highlighted cases where discussions were suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.
*   **Neymar Accusation**: He refuted Lula's accusation that Neymar supported Bolsonaro due to tax issues, calling it a "frivolous accusation" and stating that the Revenue staff are zealous and cannot be interfered with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>. He noted that Lula himself owed R$15 million to the tax authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:10">[01:54:10]</a>.
*   **Personal Image**: He dismissed accusations of being racist, homophobic, or disliking Northeasterners, citing personal relationships and past actions (e.g., saving a Black man from drowning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:56">[02:47:56]</a>. He admitted to swearing but noted he has improved and that Lula uses more profanity than him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:21">[02:51:21]</a>.

## Political Style and Electoral Context
Bolsonaro stated that he makes self-criticism daily in a "confessional" room with his ministers, discussing errors and seeking solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. He claims to interact with social media comments to find alternatives and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>.

Regarding the 2022 election, he noted that polls showed a "technical draw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">[02:42:20]</a>. He highlighted support from governors in major electoral colleges (São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro), as well as from various societal sectors including CAC (Collectors, Shooters, and Hunters), public security, Armed Forces, evangelicals, a significant part of Catholics, and agribusiness (almost 100%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">[02:42:20]</a>. He described the final stretch of the election as a "Holy War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">[02:42:20]</a>, with the Christian public becoming a key focus. He urged people to vote, emphasizing that not voting means someone else will decide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">[02:42:20]</a>.

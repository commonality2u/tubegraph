## Introduction to the Discussion
Host Rogério Vilela introduces Daniel Mastral, inviting him to discuss topics related to his experiences and books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Mastral brings copies of his books, including "The Seed of Evil," which is part of a seven-book series titled "Son of Fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. He also mentions another literary work, a trilogy about the Nephilim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Mastral states that he was once a "real legitimate Satanist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> and later, God freed him from this path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## The Reality and Power of Magic and Spells
Mastral asserts that magic and spells exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. He explains that for magic or a spell to work, it requires a "fundamental ingredient" or "fuel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If this "fuel" is removed, he is not afraid of the magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

He explains that a curse without cause "finds no landing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. If one leads a "straight life" before God and remains in God's will, magic cannot affect them; it "hits and bounces back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. However, "holes" or "gaps" in one's spiritual "armor" – such as pride, arrogance, greed, lies, and envy – provide "legality" for witchcraft to enter and take root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. These negative feelings "sadden the Holy Spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Mastral states that genuine demonic possession is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a> and often what is seen on television is "poorly rehearsed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>.

### Intentional vs. Unintentional Harm
Spells can be cast with or without intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. Wishing harm on someone, whether knowingly or unconsciously, can create negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. Mastral states that "vibrating at a negative frequency" can cause harm, even if not deep, leading to depression, feeling bad, or minor accidents ("evil eye") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

### Pacts and Demonic Alliances
Engaging in alliances with entities and demons involves making pacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. These pacts grant "some powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. The devil is portrayed as a "good salesman" skilled in marketing, offering "wonderful business" like kingdoms, power, money, and fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>. This concept is likened to Satan tempting Jesus in the desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.

Demons use the "vital energy" of human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. Elaborate spells and rituals come with a price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. Such pacts might grant success for a limited period, like ten years, leading to phenomena such as the "curse of 27 years" where successful individuals die young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>. People accept this price, often believing they won't live long anyway due to lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

## Spiritual Authority and Protection
Mastral explains that living a "straight life" before God, centered in His will, removes fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. He cites Proverbs 26:2, stating that a "curse without cause finds no landing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. He likens spiritual protection to "armor" against attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

To counter negative influences, one needs a "tripod" of prayer life, worship life, and knowledge of the word of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This leads to faith, love, and trust, making spells ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Forgiveness is crucial, as unforgiveness "keeps ruminating inside you," causing physical and spiritual harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. A life of humility and simplicity also helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Spiritual Warfare and Demonic Influence
[[Spiritual Warfare and Demonic Influence]] is a continuous reality. Mastral details that the devil is like a "roaring lion" seeking loopholes and weak points to devour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. Destabilization is necessary for a spell to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>. God permits evil through free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. He references the story of Simon the Magician in Acts Chapter 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:26">[01:28:26]</a>, noting how Simon, a wizard, deceived many until Peter, with "spiritual authority," unmasked him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a>.

Mastral describes a spiritual battle around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. He references Daniel Chapter 10, where an angel was delayed for 21 days by the "Prince of Persia," a territorial spirit, before reaching Daniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:56">[01:59:56]</a>. This indicates that spiritual entities can resist and cause "damage" to angels in this battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

### The Problem with Selling Spiritual Items
Mastral criticizes the practice of "selling the anointing, selling the handkerchief anointed with consecrated water" within the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. He considers this a marketing ploy to "invent new pearls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

## Demonic Entities and their Hierarchy
[[Concepts of spiritual warfare and demonology in Christianity]] delve into the nature of these entities. Mastral distinguishes between "Satan," from Hebrew *Satan* meaning "adversary" or "opponent," and "Devil," from Greek *diabolos* meaning "the one who brings division" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>. Lucifer, a beautiful angel (Ezekiel 28 calls him the "anointed Cherub"), rebelled against God out of envy, wishing to be like the Most High (Isaiah 14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:21">[02:20:21]</a>. He managed to persuade and drag a third of the angels with him when he was expelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>.

Fallen angels, now demons, have taught humans "a series of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>, including high magic techniques for astral projection ("unfolding") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>. He explains that these techniques are forbidden and risky, with the potential to "not return more" or come back with "sequelae" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:12">[03:06:12]</a>.

### Nephilim and Giants
Mastral interprets Genesis 6 as fallen angels copulating with human women, resulting in the birth of "giants" (Nephilim) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:09">[02:22:09]</a>. These giants, like Goliath, continued to exist even after the flood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:33">[02:23:33]</a>. He explains that demonic entities can materialize in feminine (succubus) or masculine (incubus) forms within ritualistic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>. They carry "germ cells" charged with "energy" that can cause mutations and deform DNA, resulting in the birth of anomalies or giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>. This concept links to ancient demigods and figures from Mesopotamian, Sumerian, Egyptian, Aztec, Inca, and Mayan cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>.

### Specific Entities and their Influence
*   **Astaroth**: One of the Satanic entities, described as the "prince of lust and corruption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:28">[04:15:28]</a>. King Solomon reportedly "bowed down to Astaroth" and learned to dominate demons through a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:47">[04:28:47]</a>.
*   **Leviathan**: According to Mastral, Leviathan, a "Sea Serpent" or "Sea Dragon" connected to waters, is believed to be acting over Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>. Brazilian deities, predominantly female figures connected to water, are linked to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:49">[02:18:49]</a>.

### Demons and Souls
Mastral states that demons are purely spiritual beings, without souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:58">[03:12:58]</a>, unlike humans who have body, soul, and spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:20">[03:12:20]</a>. He claims there are "many more entities around people... than people on earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:10">[02:20:10]</a>. These entities, through "sentinels," have access to people's entire lives and memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:25">[02:20:25]</a>.

## Satanic Organizations and their Goals
Mastral reveals he was part of "The Brotherhood," a "high magic sect" with tentacles in various parts of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:50">[03:53:50]</a>. This group is more "hermetic" and "elitist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>. Their primary objective is to "prepare the setting for the coming of the Antichrist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:59">[04:09:59]</a>.

### Freemasonry and the Brotherhood
Mastral states that Freemasonry is "one of the arms of the Brotherhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:28">[04:17:28]</a>. He clarifies that not every Freemason is a Satanist, as true Satanic worship is only revealed at the "33rd Degree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:57">[04:19:57]</a>. At higher levels, they worship Baphomet, a figure with a "body of woman's hooves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:15">[04:22:15]</a>.

### Underground Cities and Apocalypse Preparation
Members of the "High Elite" associated with these groups are preparing to hide in five large "underground cities" (bankers) capable of holding 20,000 people each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:18">[04:46:18]</a>. These are designed to preserve them during a "3rd war" when the "church was raptured" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This "very attractive" vision is used to recruit members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>.

### Historical Figures and their Influence
*   **Solomon**: The Bible states Solomon "bowed down to Astaroth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:47">[04:28:47]</a>. He reportedly imprisoned 72 demons in a bronze vessel and learned rituals to dominate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:55">[04:34:55]</a>. Mastral mentions books like "The Greater Key of Solomon" and "The Lesser Key of Solomon" as guides for high magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:57">[04:46:57]</a>.
*   **Rasputin**: Described as a "mix of priest with wizard" who achieved "great power" and "fantastic" persuasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:31">[04:44:31]</a>. He influenced the last Romanovs, even stopping a bleeding boy's hemorrhage over the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:55">[04:54:55]</a>.
*   **Aleister Crowley**: A "very famous satanist" and "great wizard" whose writings (e.g., "The Book of the Law") are references in high witchcraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>. He influenced The Beatles (Sargent Pepper's album cover) and films like "The Wizard of Oz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:11">[03:29:11]</a>.

## Prophecies and the End Times
The discussion delves into [[spiritual themes and religious interpretations]] of biblical prophecies. Mastral mentions that the current era is the "beginning of sorrows" as described in Matthew Chapter 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:51">[03:52:51]</a>, including plagues, pestilences, tsunamis, and earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:34">[03:53:34]</a>.

### The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
Mastral interprets the [[biblical_interpretations_and_gnostic_perspectives]] of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse:
1.  **White Horse (Antichrist)**: Represents power, bringing "false peace" through oratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:56">[03:09:56]</a>. He has a bow but no arrows, symbolizing that he will first bring peace before war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:03">[03:11:03]</a>.
2.  **Red Horse**: Represents war, initiating after the false peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:02">[03:13:02]</a>.
3.  **Black Horse**: Represents plague, which will be much worse than the current pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:39">[03:19:39]</a>.
4.  **Pale Horse**: Represents death, marking the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:54">[03:19:54]</a>.

### Mark of the Beast and Future Control
Mastral believes a "super vaccine" developed by Bill Gates, possibly ready by mid-2023, will immunize against major pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>. This vaccine uses a "stamp" technology containing a substance called "luciferase" (curiously named) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:01">[03:05:01]</a>. This stamp, invisible without a special application, will be placed on the wrist and allow individuals to buy, sell, travel, and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:44">[03:04:44]</a>. Those who refuse it will be "outside the commercial network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:37">[03:05:37]</a>.

### Rebuilding the Temple and Armageddon
The "reconstruction of the Temple" in Jerusalem is seen as another prophetic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:32">[03:06:32]</a>. The Temple Institute has plans, clothes, and utensils ready for its construction, needing only the physical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>. This would involve demolishing an existing mosque, likely triggering a world war (Armageddon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:29">[03:07:29]</a>. Biological weapons are now seen as more effective than nuclear ones, preserving infrastructure while targeting populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### The False Prophet
Mastral discusses the "eighth king" in Revelation 17, who will be the "false prophet" and give "support for the Antichrist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:34">[03:13:34]</a>. He links this to the succession of popes since the Lateran Treaty in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:35">[03:16:35]</a>, with Pope Francis being the seventh, and the eighth pope being the false prophet. This eighth pope's numerological sum of digits (from his 257th ordinal number) will form "six" (666) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:28">[03:17:28]</a>.

## Personal Experiences and Insights
Mastral shares his journey out of [[the_origins_and_symbolism_of_satan_in_religious_texts]] and into Christianity.

### The Exorcism of a Teenager
Mastral recounts a personal [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare]] experience with a demon-possessed teenager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. He explains that his anointing oil, made according to Exodus's recipe, holds power because God ordered its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. During the exorcism, the girl displayed abnormal physical contortions, a deep voice, and dilated pupils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>. The lights flickered and went out, and objects moved in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:43:09]</a>. Mastral emphasizes praying aloud, as the devil cannot read minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>.

### Confronting Demonic Spells
Mastral reveals he performed spells intended to kill a pastor, but the spells failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:32">[01:55:32]</a>. He describes feeling a "field," "energy," or "force" around the pastor that repelled him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:08">[01:58:08]</a>. His conversion was marked by an overwhelming sense of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:37">[01:59:37]</a>.

### Persecution and Divine Protection
After his conversion, Mastral faced threats and persecution from his former Brotherhood associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>. He relied on God's protection, even seeing angels guarding his house in an "extraordinary" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:52">[02:25:52]</a>. He believes God allowed him to see this for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:28">[02:25:28]</a>. Two of his former tormentors died in a car accident after he prayed for God's intervention, which he saw as a judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:32">[02:27:32]</a>.

## Debunking Misconceptions
*   **Reptilians and Nibiru**: Mastral dismisses "reptilians" and "Planet Nibiru" as urban legends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:44">[02:34:44]</a>.
*   **Mayan Calendar**: He states the Mayan calendar's end date (December 21, 2012) also came to nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:19">[02:35:19]</a>.
*   **Subliminal Messages**: He addresses the idea that music played backward contains satanic messages, acknowledging that some recordings do, but often it's a coincidental sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:20">[03:07:20]</a>.
*   **Birthday Celebrations**: He debunks the idea that birthday celebrations are related to Satanism, calling it a "lack of knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

## Conclusion
Mastral emphasizes the importance of faith and dependence on God, particularly in times of difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:08">[02:04:08]</a>. He reiterates that depression is a disease and encourages seeking help, including therapy and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:46">[03:32:46]</a>. His closing message is one of strength in God and faith, especially during pandemics and personal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:57">[03:35:57]</a>.

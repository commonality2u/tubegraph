The discussion around [[Role of faith and rationality in understanding belief | faith and rationality in understanding belief]] often extends into the nature of science itself, with a particular focus on how different fields, including theology, are categorized and perceived [01:05:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.

## Theology as Science

A persistent debate exists regarding the extent to which theology can be considered a science [00:36:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. Some academics may abhor calling anything related to humanities a science [00:38:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>, while others acknowledge that science, regardless of the field, is dynamic [00:36:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. Archeology, for instance, is seen as a study of humanity's past that consistently uses scientific methods and interfaces with historical sciences [00:38:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. However, historical sciences work with limitations regarding their object of study, sometimes making traditional scientific testing inapplicable or difficult to repeat when desired [00:39:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. Despite these complexities, there is rigor in science, and theologians work with scientific methods [01:05:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.

## Public Perception of Science and Religion

There's a common misconception that all scientists think uniformly, or that science operates like a Vatican with everyone praying the same "parody text" [01:13:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. This caricatured image, often perpetuated by the media, suggests a monolithic view of scientific consensus [01:12:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>. In reality, academic fields, including archaeology and biology, are characterized by numerous internal debates and diverse interpretations [01:05:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a> [01:06:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

It is important for those in media to clearly communicate that their views are personal positions and not necessarily universal truths within their field [01:31:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:26">[01:31:26]</a>. Otherwise, the lay public might think that everyone agrees with a specific perspective [01:16:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. This applies to both scientific findings and [[Spiritual teachings and beliefs | spiritual teachings and beliefs]].

## The Influence of Historical Interpretation

Interpretations of historical and religious texts can be influenced by tradition and mistranslations, leading to long-standing misconceptions [02:49:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:25">[02:49:25]</a> [02:50:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:18">[02:50:18]</a>. For example, some historical theological interpretations believed that animals could not evolve and that nothing created by God could become extinct [02:53:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:50">[02:53:50]</a> [02:54:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:13">[02:54:13]</a>. This was based on a mistranslation of Genesis and was an interpretation of the time, not necessarily a direct biblical statement [02:50:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:21">[02:50:21]</a> [02:57:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>.

## Personal and Social Influences on Belief

The [[Influence of spirituality and faith | influence of spirituality and faith]] and [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | the existence of God]] often intertwine with personal experiences and social dynamics.

### Psychological Factors
A person's belief or disbelief can sometimes be a reaction to personal trauma or upbringing rather than purely intellectual motivations [03:18:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:25">[03:18:25]</a> [03:07:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:46">[03:07:46]</a>. For instance, the profile of prominent atheists like Darwin and Freud shows similarities in their relationship with their fathers, often described as highly religious, legalistic, and authoritarian figures who could be perceived as terrible representatives of God [03:04:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>. This suggests that a distorted idea of God can stem from negative paternal relationships [03:08:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:23">[03:08:23]</a>.

> [!quote] The Atheist's Comfort
> "It's easier emotionally to imagine that the sky is empty, then you don't have anyone to hate. If there is no one up there, I understand that leukemia in a child is biological; life is just like this. Now, if there is someone up there, the mother who abandoned you is alive; she didn't die, she's alive, but she didn't want you. Then this God doesn't even exist. So, for me, there is someone to hate. So, not to hate anyone, it's better to imagine that mom died when I was born than believing that she is alive and didn't want me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>

This perspective highlights that for some, atheism or agnosticism can be a more comfortable emotional stance in the face of suffering, as it removes the notion of a loving but absent or neglectful deity [03:12:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:20">[03:12:20]</a>.

### Social Acceptance and Morality
There is a societal notion in Brazil that atheists are immoral individuals who engage in harmful acts because they "don't owe anyone anything" [03:24:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:18">[03:24:18]</a>. This idea asserts that morality can only come from being religious [03:24:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:29">[03:24:29]</a>. However, figures who speak on atheism emphasize that atheists are not bogeymen and work to make individuals understand they are not alone in their beliefs or questions [03:24:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:09">[03:24:09]</a> [03:24:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:37">[03:24:37]</a>.

Similarly, it can sometimes be convenient to be a believer for the sake of social acceptance [03:19:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:11">[03:19:11]</a>.

## Debates within Atheism and Religion

Neither atheism nor religious belief is a uniform group [02:54:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a> [03:25:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Atheist movements often divide into various factions [03:25:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:02">[03:25:02]</a>, and there are many atheists who disagree with each other on various points beyond the belief in God [03:26:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>. The same applies to religious groups, such as different [[Catholic beliefs and practices | Catholic beliefs and practices]] or Christian denominations.

The goal of public dialogue on these topics should be dialogue, not confrontation [03:28:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:54">[03:28:54]</a>. The aim is not to convert but to clarify and present various arguments and perspectives, allowing individuals to reflect on their own beliefs or disbeliefs [03:22:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:49">[03:22:49]</a> [03:18:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:20">[03:18:20]</a>.

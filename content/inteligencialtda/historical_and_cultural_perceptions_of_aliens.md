From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

The perception of [[theories_on_extraterrestrial_life_and_the_universe | extraterrestrial life]] and [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | alien sightings]] has undergone a significant transformation, evolving from subjects of ridicule to matters of national security and scientific inquiry. This shift is influenced by media, government reports, and changing terminology, while also grappling with deeply ingrained psychological and cultural factors.

## Evolution of Public Perception

Historically, [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | ufology]] was often met with skepticism and ridicule, associated with individuals who "put aluminum foil on the head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Pilots, for instance, were "ashamed to be ridiculed" for reporting sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

However, since approximately 2017, [[international_perspectives_and_media_portrayal | international media]] began to take [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | ufology]] "very seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, framing it as a "national security issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This shift gained momentum with the release of videos validated by the Pentagon, leading people to view the topic "in a less way" of jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Notably, the *New York Times* started covering these phenomena seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

A 2021 report from the United States government indicated that 65% of Americans believe in [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | UFOs]], and 90% consider them "harmless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. This contrasts sharply with earlier perceptions.

### From UFO to UAP

The terminology itself has evolved. What were once called [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | UFOs]] (Unidentified Flying Objects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a> are now frequently referred to as UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. This change in nomenclature aims to broaden the scope of investigation and move away from the sensationalist connotations of "UFO" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>, acknowledging that not all unexplained aerial phenomena are necessarily objects, and many can be attributed to known atmospheric phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to Perception

Several elements shape public and scientific perceptions of aliens.

### Government and Military Involvement

Government agencies, particularly the U.S. military, have played a significant role in recent years. In 2016-2017, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request led to the release of significant material from the American Navy, including videos of [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | unidentified aerial phenomena]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. The Pentagon later confirmed these videos were real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

In June 2021, the U.S. Congress established a committee to study these phenomena, requiring annual reports for six years to inform the public on their findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. NASA also formed a committee of 16 people, including astronauts, to collect data and information on UAPs in a "best possible way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>.

> [!info] Military Concerns
> The shift in focus to UAPs by military and intelligence communities highlights concerns about national security and air sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Some hypothesize that these phenomena could be advanced technology from other countries, such as Russia or China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>. There is also a theory that government secrecy about these phenomena might be to divert attention from other issues or to justify military spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:08">[02:22:08]</a>.

### Media and Pop Culture Influence

Movies like *E.T.* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>, *Arrival* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>, *Don't Look Up* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>, and *Signs* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:08">[02:22:08]</a> have shaped popular images and narratives around aliens. Early science fiction and the [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | Roswell incident]] in 1947, where objects described as "flying saucers" were reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>, also contributed to modern [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | ufology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

### Psychological and Social Factors

Human perception and psychological biases significantly influence [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | reports of encounters]]:

*   **Suggestion and Hypnosis:** Hypnosis was historically used in ufology to "reclaim" memories of [[extraterrestrial_encounters_and_abductions | abductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. However, it's noted that human brains are highly susceptible to suggestion, and such memories could be traumatic reinterpretations of other events, including abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>.
*   **Mass Hysteria:** Events like Operation Plate in Brazil, where local populations reported [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | lights in the sky]] and associated burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:09">[02:48:09]</a>, are often interpreted as collective psychological outbreaks due to fear and sensationalist media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:14">[02:49:14]</a>.
*   **Pareidolia:** The human brain's tendency to find patterns and familiar shapes in random stimuli, like faces on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:04">[03:00:04]</a>, is a common explanation for misinterpreting natural phenomena as signs of alien life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:27">[03:00:27]</a>.
*   **Fatigue and Isolation:** Extreme conditions like prolonged sleep deprivation or isolation can lead to psychotic episodes and hallucinations, where individuals might "see things that this there it is interesting because there are several witnesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:06">[02:53:06]</a>.

### Charlatanism and Exploitation

The public's fascination with aliens has unfortunately given rise to exploitation. Individuals have capitalized on people's "fragility" by selling "land" that would be "free from the big [disaster]" of a supposed planet Nibiru hitting Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:20">[02:21:20]</a>. These individuals often fabricate evidence, using sophisticated language or claiming telepathic communication with aliens to support their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. The lack of standardized reporting and physical evidence in [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | ufology]] makes it vulnerable to such deceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:10">[02:01:10]</a>.

## Notable Cases and Theories

### Bob Lazar

Bob Lazar is a prominent figure in [[conspiracy_theories_involving_possible_alien_involvement | ufology]] who claims to have worked on Area 51, reverse-engineering alien technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>. However, his claims are often questioned due to a lack of verifiable credentials and the absence of scientific sense in his explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>.

### Varginha Incident (Brazil)

The Varginha incident is a famous Brazilian [[alien_sightings_and_ufos | UFO case]] where three sisters reportedly encountered an alien creature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:17">[02:41:17]</a>. The narrative includes the creature being captured by the military and autopsied by a forensic doctor in Campinas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:57">[02:36:57]</a>. While the city of Varginha has embraced the story for tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:05">[02:41:05]</a>, the official explanation often points to a homeless man with a skin disease being mistaken for an alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:52">[02:41:52]</a>.

### Ancient Astronaut Theory

The ancient astronaut theory, popularized by authors like Erich von DÃ¤niken in *Chariots of the Gods?*, suggests that ancient civilizations were influenced by [[theories_on_extraterrestrial_life_and_the_universe | extraterrestrial beings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:23">[02:50:23]</a>. This theory interprets ancient artifacts, drawings, and texts as evidence of alien contact, such as figures with helmets or precise stonework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:41">[02:50:41]</a>.

### Fermi Paradox and Great Filter

The [[scientific_and_philosophical_theories_about_alien_life | Fermi Paradox]] asks why, if intelligent life is probable, we haven't found evidence of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>. One explanation is the "Great Filter" theory, which posits that all civilizations face moments of mass extinction or self-destruction, preventing long-term survival or widespread contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions, with some eliminating up to 95% of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:56">[01:50:56]</a>.

## Scientific Approaches

Despite the challenges, scientists are actively engaged in the search for [[theories_on_extraterrestrial_life_and_the_universe | extraterrestrial life]]:

*   **Astrobiology:** This field studies the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe, focusing on the conditions necessary for life (e.g., carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **SETI Project:** The Search for [[theories_on_extraterrestrial_life_and_the_universe | Extraterrestrial Intelligence]] uses large radio antennas to listen for "coherent signals" from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:09">[02:02:09]</a>.
*   **Biosignatures and Technosignatures:** Scientists look for "biosignatures" (gases in exoplanet atmospheres indicative of life) using telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:17">[01:36:17]</a>. They also search for "technosignatures," which are signs of advanced technology, such as Dyson spheres (hypothetical megastructures built to harness a star's energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:25">[02:04:25]</a>.
*   **Galileo Project:** Led by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, this project aims to develop highly sensitive cameras to detect [[theories_on_extraterrestrial_life_and_the_universe | interstellar objects]] that might be alien probes, allowing for interception and study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:02">[02:08:02]</a>.

## Open Questions

Despite advancements in scientific understanding and technological capabilities, the question of [[theories_on_extraterrestrial_life_and_the_universe | extraterrestrial life]] remains open. The vastness of space and the complexity of life's origins make contact challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The role of time, differing dimensional perceptions, and the uniformity of physical laws across the universe are all factors debated in the context of potential encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>.

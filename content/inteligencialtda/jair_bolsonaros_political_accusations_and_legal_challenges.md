The "Limited Intelligence" program aims to explore the intricacies of politics, focusing on events in Brazil and addressing common public doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. A notable event was Jair Bolsonaro's live broadcast as president, which set a world record with nearly 2 million simultaneous viewers a week before the second round of one of Brazil's most contested elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Allegations of Persecution and Political Motivation

Jair Bolsonaro states that his inner circle has been under investigation since 2021 when he was President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. He claims these inquiries are confidential, restricting access to information, and describe the process as "evidentiary fishing" where authorities scrutinize everything to find anything suspicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. He asserts that these actions are prohibited by the Supreme Federal Court's own decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Bolsonaro believes there is a "bad will" or "desire" to incriminate him for anything that emerges, suggesting a campaign of "mockery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. He argues that he is being targeted because he ended corruption, contrasting his situation with former leaders who were investigated for corruption, a charge he never faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

## Specific Legal and Political Challenges

### Ineligibility Trial and Electoral Issues

Bolsonaro's ineligibility stems from a meeting with ambassadors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. He states that the Federal Police, seemingly starting from the January 8th events, retroactively investigated his actions to find grounds for accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. He particularly highlights a live broadcast from July 29, 2021, where he discussed an inquiry into alleged election fraud on his part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. He contrasts this with the treatment of petitions questioning Lula's victory, which were met with fines and denials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

He criticizes the TSE's resolutions, noting that electoral laws must come into force a year before elections and resolutions six months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. He specifically mentions a TSE resolution in mid-October 2022, between the first and second rounds, which he believes was an effort by Alexandre de Moraes to prevent right-wing pages from freely disclosing his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This restriction prevented him from showing his September 7th image, or images of Lula defending abortion or commenting on cell phone theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. He also alleges that the TSE spent money on a campaign encouraging 16- and 17-year-olds to register to vote, an age group that predominantly votes for the left, which he estimates gained Lula over 2 million votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

Bolsonaro argues that these decisions, coupled with the censorship of pages like Luciano Hang's, which supported him, constituted heavy-handed influence that impacted the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:09">[02:51:09]</a>. He believes the refusal to allow him to present counter-arguments against accusations of being genocidal, racist, or homophobic, and the disappearance of radio inserts, further swayed the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:25">[02:47:25]</a>.

He points out that Dilma Rousseff's ticket in 2014 was judged, and evidence was not accepted due to "excess evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:31">[03:36:31]</a>. He stresses that the TCU decided that regardless of value, very personal jewelry gifts belong to former presidents until specific legislation is passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>.

### January 8th Events and Coup Allegations

Bolsonaro faces accusations of orchestrating a coup, specifically linked to the events of January 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. He vehemently denies these claims, stating that the idea that he began planning a coup in July 2021 to culminate on January 8th is absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. He highlights that on January 8th, no weapons were seized at the legislative police station, except for a "stretching and a half two balls of good G" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. He also points out that he tweeted three times condemning the events of January 8th from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

He questions why the Supreme Court and Alexandre de Moraes have not shown the "coup draft" or "coup minutes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. Bolsonaro states that a coup requires troops, tanks, leadership, and financing, none of which were present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>. He argues that his money, around R$800,000, which he converted to dollars and deposited in the U.S., is insufficient to finance a coup, calling the accusation ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. He further asserts that the general whose computer contained the alleged "coup plan" has not been heard, because his explanation would debunk the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

He questions the lack of action by the government on January 8th, stating that ABIN (Brazilian Intelligence Agency) sent over 30 messages to GSI (Institutional Security Office) about the possibility of riots, but nothing was done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. He suggests that the government "stimulated" the events by not taking preventive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. He also points to Lula's comment about wanting to know "who left the doors open" at the presidency, suggesting a planned event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

Tarcísio adds that discussing "constitutional hypotheses" is normal in meetings and that Dilma Rousseff herself discussed a state of siege with the army commander before her impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. He emphasizes that Bolsonaro appointed the chief minister of the Civil House to lead the transition, which occurred without incident, indicating no intention of a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

### Mauro Cid's Plea Bargain and Allegations of Coercion

Bolsonaro alleges that Mauro Cid's plea bargain was extracted under duress, with Judge Alexandre de Moraes threatening Cid's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. He cites a leaked phone conversation where Cid reportedly said, "There's no point in me telling the truth, they want me to say something to give substance to what they have in mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. Bolsonaro emphasizes that a plea bargain is invalid if signed with the defendant arrested, which he claims happened with Cid after over 100 days in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

### Marielle Franco Murder Investigation

Bolsonaro recounts being accused for six years of being the mentor behind the deaths of Marielle and Franco, merely because one of the accused lived in his condominium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. He highlights false narratives, such as his son dating the accused's daughter (who lived in the U.S.), and an attempt to link him to a phone call made by a murderer to his condominium, despite him being in the UAE at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

### Whale Harassment Investigation

Bolsonaro was investigated for "harassment of cetaceans" (whales), stemming from an image of him on a jetski near a whale in Guarujá <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. He points out that tourist activities in the area involve whale interaction and questions the motivation behind this specific accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

### Vaccination Card Forgery

Bolsonaro states his vaccination card was falsely manipulated twice, once in Peru (São Paulo) and once in Duque de Caxias, showing him as vaccinated, despite him not having taken the vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. He argues that this would be demoralizing for him, given his public stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. He mentions that the email address associated with one of the forged vaccination entries was `lula@gmail.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. He states that a search and seizure was conducted at his home to find a vaccine card, which was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.

### Adélio Bispo Attack Investigation

Bolsonaro criticizes the investigation into the 2018 assassination attempt against him, conducted by Federal Police delegate Rodrigo Mora Fernandes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:21">[02:13:21]</a>. He highlights that Fernandes concluded Adélio Bispo acted alone, despite information suggesting he was affiliated with PSOL and received legal defense from well-connected lawyers shortly after the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>. Bolsonaro states that the delegate was later promoted by Lula to the intelligence directorate of the Federal Police, and this directorate allegedly spent two years "chasing a guy called Jair Bolsonaro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>. He also brings up the claim that Adélio had ties to the PCC, which the delegate concluded was unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:34">[02:16:34]</a>.

### Corporate Cards Secrecy

Bolsonaro explains there are three types of corporate cards: one for the Alvorada residence (covering expenses for family, security, staff), one for presidential trips, and a smaller personal card allowing withdrawals of up to R$20,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:36">[02:09:36]</a>. He claims he never used the personal card, never took a penny, and delivered it when the issue became public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:29">[02:10:29]</a>. He says the secrecy was to protect the privacy of people like Michele's hairdresser or manicurist from malicious individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:32">[02:11:32]</a>. He states that when the secrecy was lifted, nothing confidential was found, contrasting this with Lula's government, which also imposed secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:52">[02:11:52]</a>.

### Congressional Actions and Executive Decisions

Bolsonaro discusses the CPI of Lavatoga, stating that he didn't support it because it lacked congressional support and would only cause "wear and tear and noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. He believes that if he had 50% of the Chamber and Senate, he could change Brazil's destiny by restoring the balance of powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:49">[02:24:49]</a>.

Regarding monocratic decisions, Bolsonaro states he doesn't recall vetoing the law regarding them, but he finds the idea of an "undemocratic veto for the project law" complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

He addresses the electoral fund, noting it increased from R$1.7 billion to nearly R$5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:23">[02:39:23]</a>. He explains he vetoed it, knowing the veto would be overturned, to avoid losing parliamentary support, describing it as part of the "game rule" to operate in Brasilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>.

## Bolsonaro's Defense Strategy and Outlook

Bolsonaro expresses no concerns about the accusations against him, asserting his innocence and that of others condemned alongside him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:33">[08:33:33]</a>. He believes the legal process is flawed and that the burden of proof should be on his accusers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:30">[03:00:30]</a>. He suggests that the objective of these challenges is to remove him from politics and end "Bolsonarism," which he prefers to call conservatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:20">[02:52:20]</a>.

His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who is currently in the United States on leave from his parliamentary position, states that his decision to stay abroad is to end the "injustice" and "curb the momentum of these dictators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>. He believes he is more useful to Brazil there, engaging with American authorities to expose events in Brazil, including the persecution against his father and cases like that of Débora Rodrigues dos Santos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. Eduardo implies that if he returned to Brazil, he would be jailed and unable to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.

Bolsonaro and Tarcísio highlight the cases of individuals like Débora, a hairdresser sentenced to 14 years for painting a statue with lipstick during the January 8th events, as examples of "tremendous injustice" and "absurd" sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>. They believe the judiciary's actions are excessive and politically motivated, designed to intimidate Bolsonaro's supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. Bolsonaro states that such severe punishments are an attempt to eliminate the largest spontaneous and volunteer political movement of his generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>.

## Role of Allies

Tarcísio de Freitas, Governor of São Paulo, emphasizes his loyalty to Bolsonaro, stating he will be a defense witness for him and that his gratitude to Bolsonaro is immense for opening doors in politics for technicians rather than just party members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. He asserts that during Bolsonaro's presidency, he never saw him plan or do anything outside the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">[01:44:44]</a>.

Eduardo Bolsonaro is working with Felipe Barros to request a public hearing for Mike Benz, who has spoken about alleged U.S. interference in Brazil's electoral process through entities like USAID funding the TSE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>. Mike Benz reportedly concluded that if USAID hadn't existed, Bolsonaro would still be president, indicating clear external interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Eduardo also mentions China's alleged interest in removing Bolsonaro to facilitate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.

Tarcísio also addresses accusations of rapprochement with the STF and Lula, clarifying that his interactions are institutional, aimed at defending São Paulo's interests, such as land regularization, civic-military schools, and privatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:47">[02:37:47]</a>. He stresses that his loyalty to Bolsonaro remains absolute, and he supports him "even underwater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:04">[02:38:04]</a>.

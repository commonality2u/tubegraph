The Protestant Reformation, which began in 1517, gave rise to two primary theological lines within Protestantism: Calvinism and Arminianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. These two viewpoints faced each other in a debate at the Synod of Dort in 1618-1619 in the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## [[arm_cal_debate | Calvinism]]

Calvinism, as defined at the Synod of Dort, is summarized by five core points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>:

*   **Total Depravity**: This means that human beings were affected by the Fall in their full sense â€“ in their reason, emotion, and volition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. There is no human being who is not a sinner; all are born in sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Sin affects every area of human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. The statement that "man is essentially good" (as proposed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau) is considered a mistake; man is essentially bad unless God transforms him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   **Unconditional Election**: This point asserts that God chooses humanity, not the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Humanity's love for God is a "reflux" of God's initial love for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Atonement**: This refers to the work of Christ on the cross. It states that Christ did not die merely to make salvation possible, but he effectively died to save his church, his "sheep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:02]</a>.
*   **Irresistible Grace** (or Effective Vocation): This means that when God calls, he calls effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. Jesus stated, "My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me; I give them eternal life, and no one will ever snatch them from my hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
*   **Perseverance of the Saints**: A person who is truly saved has their salvation guaranteed by God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. There is no possibility of someone being a "son of God" today and a "son of the Devil" tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. If a saved person sins, they remain a child of God, but may experience disciplinary treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

The fundamental thesis of Calvinism is God's sovereignty in [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. Salvation is seen as a work planned, executed, and consummated by God, so that the glory belongs to God, not to humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. When a person makes a decision for God, it is because God himself has acted upon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

### Free Will in Calvinism

Calvinism believes in "free agency," not "free will" in the sense of Adam before the Fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. After the Fall, humanity's inclination is towards error, making it impossible not to sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. While individuals can choose their paths (e.g., left or right, travel or stay), this is "free agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. "Free will" refers to the power to choose good and practice it in its fullness, which humanity lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. Spiritually, humanity is considered "dead" (Greek: *necros*), meaning unable to act or react towards salvation on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

Despite God's sovereignty, human beings remain 100% responsible for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. No one can claim they were not chosen if they rejected the Gospel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. When a human heart inclines towards God, it is because God has already "quickened the soul," removing spiritual "earplugs" and "blindfolds," and replacing a "heart of stone" with a "heart of flesh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>.

## [[arm_cal_debate | Arminianism]]

Arminianism, named after Jacobus Arminius, a Dutch theologian, posits different ideas concerning human nature and salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>:

*   **Not Totally Depraved**: It holds that humanity is not totally depraved, allowing individuals to make their own choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
*   **Free Will**: Arminianism affirms that humanity possesses free will and is responsible for their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. Individuals decide whether to accept or reject salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>. The "control" of salvation is seen as being in humanity's hands, implying that even if Christ died, one could still be condemned if they choose not to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

## Key Differences: [[arm_cal_debate | Arminianism vs Calvinism Debate]]

The core distinction lies in the role of human choice versus divine sovereignty in salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.
*   **Calvinism**: Emphasizes that God is sovereign and initiates salvation, working within individuals to prompt their decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.
*   **Arminianism**: Emphasizes human freedom and responsibility, asserting that individuals are free and powerful enough to choose or reject salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

## Related Theological Concepts

### God's Foreknowledge and Human Responsibility
God's foreknowledge (omniscience) means he knows everything, including the future and every human action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>. However, this divine foreknowledge does not negate human responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>. For example, God knew humanity would fall, but the plan of redemption precedes the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. The Lamb (Christ) was slain "before the foundation of the world" in God's eternal plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. When a person refuses the Gospel, it is their personal choice, for which God is not responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. God inclines the heart, but the decision is made "delightfully freely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>.

### Salvation and Justification by Faith
[[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | Salvation]] is described as a work of God from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | Justification by faith]] is a core doctrine of Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>. When a person believes in Jesus as their personal Savior, three transactions occur on the cross in their favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:51">[02:24:51]</a>:
1.  **Sin imputed to Christ**: God does not charge humanity's transgressions to their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>. Instead, he took humanity's entire debt and put it on Christ's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:36">[02:25:36]</a>.
2.  **Debt cancelled**: Jesus tore up and cancelled humanity's debt, nailing it to the cross and declaring "It is finished" (Tetelestai, meaning "paid") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:44">[02:25:44]</a>.
3.  **Christ's righteousness credited**: God credits the infinite righteousness of Christ to the believer's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:32">[02:26:32]</a>.

[[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | Justification]] is more than forgiveness. Forgiveness is a negative concept (debt paid, no longer owe), while justification is a positive concept (receiving a credit of Christ's righteousness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>. This means a believer is "quits with the law of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. When confessing sins, God is faithful and just to forgive because the sin has already been paid on the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:11">[02:29:11]</a>.

### Problem of Evil and Suffering
Evil is the fruit of sin, which emerged after the Fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:32">[02:54:32]</a>. Before sin, humanity lived in harmony with God, others, self, and nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40">[02:54:40]</a>. Sin disaggregated these relationships, leading to rebellion against God, conflict with others, internal guilt and fear, and exploitation of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a>.

### The Problem of Sin and Human Responsibility
God did not create robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. He gave commands that needed to be obeyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:48">[02:21:48]</a>. Disobeying God's command is an act of rebellion and a desire for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The fall of humanity, like the fall of [[concepts_of_spiritual_warfare_and_demonology_in_christianity | Lucifer]], was rooted in pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:32">[02:26:32]</a>.

### Death and its Types
The word "death" in Hebrew and Greek means "separation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>.
*   **Spiritual Death**: Separation of humanity from God, which can be reversed by conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:40">[02:27:40]</a>.
*   **Physical Death**: Separation of the soul from the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:45">[02:27:45]</a>. For a Christian, upon physical death, the soul is perfected and enters heaven consciously, while the body returns to dust and the spirit to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:20">[02:28:20]</a>.
*   **Eternal Death (Second Death)**: When an individual dies without repenting or believing, they face permanent banishment from God's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:52">[02:28:52]</a>. There is no salvation, reincarnation, or opportunity for reversal after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:07">[02:29:07]</a>.

### Salvation Before Christ
People who lived before Christ were saved by believing in the Messiah who was to come, the "Christ of the Promise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>. Jesus is presented as the only Savior, and all things in the Old Testament (e.g., Abraham's descendant, Pillar of Cloud, Manna, Passover Lamb, Tabernacle, Temple, festivals, sacrifices, Sabbath) were shadows pointing to him, the reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>. Today, believers look to the Christ who has already come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:37">[03:03:37]</a>.

### Those Without Access to the Gospel
God has revealed himself in four ways: creation, conscience, scriptures, and Jesus Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:41">[03:33:41]</a>. Everyone has a moral court within them, a sense of right and wrong, meaning no human being is inexcusable before God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. Natural revelation is sufficient to hold people accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:39">[03:40:39]</a>. However, the special revelation of the Gospel is necessary to lead to salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Ignorance is not a path to heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. The church has a vital responsibility to do missions and preach the Gospel to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:51">[03:52:51]</a>.

### Children and Those with Special Health Problems
Children who die before reaching the age of reason, or individuals with special health problems that prevent cognitive awareness, are considered regenerated and saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Regeneration is a secret, inner work of the Holy Spirit in the heart where humanity has no participation or awareness, similar to conception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. These individuals are not pure in the sense of impeccability (as all have sinned), but are considered innocent in the sense of not having malice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. There is no defined age of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

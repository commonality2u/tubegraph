[[Neuroscience and brain function | Neuroscience]] as a scientific research discipline is relatively young, having been revolutionized at the beginning of the 20th century [02:27:06].

## Historical Foundations
Early in the 20th century, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a Spanish researcher, revolutionized [[Neuroscience and brain function | neuroscience]] by using microscopes to observe [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] [02:46:06]. He proposed that [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] were not continuous but had spaces between them, allowing for signal transmission [02:46:06]. Ramón y Cajal, also a talented artist, meticulously drew what he observed, creating the first images of neural circuits [02:47:06]. Despite not speaking German, the lingua franca of biology in Europe at the time, he published his findings in a Spanish magazine, compelling German scientists to learn Spanish to understand his work [02:48:06]. He shared the Nobel Prize in 1906 with Camillo Golgi, who also researched neural networks but did not believe in synapses [03:14:59].

## Modern Neuroscience Developments
The field has progressed significantly, moving from studying individual [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] to understanding [[Neuroscience and brain function | neural networks]] and their collective activity [03:22:06].

### Multi-Neuron Recording
Early in his career, the speaker's advisor, Dr. César, encouraged him to study [[Neuroscience and brain function | neural networks]] rather than individual [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]], a challenging and risky endeavor at the time [03:25:06]. Recording electrical signals from hundreds of [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] in freely moving animals was considered technically difficult, almost impossible [03:26:06]. This marked a significant conceptual shift from focusing on single [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] (e.g., "easy [[Neuroscience and brain function | neuron]]s," "motor [[Neuroscience and brain function | neuron]]s") to understanding how entire networks operate [03:26:06]. This approach aims to observe the brain's internal workings without imposing anthropomorphic projections [03:27:06].

The speaker, with his great friend João, sent 52 letters to various scientists worldwide, seeking a laboratory willing to support this risky research [03:28:06]. They eventually found a "crazy guy" in Philadelphia who accepted the idea [03:31:06]. The team, including engineers and computer scientists, had to build the entire electronic system, including current amplifiers and computer filters, as ready-made components did not exist [03:32:06]. They also developed a neurosurgical procedure to implant microelectrodes that could last for months [03:42:06].

The first significant results were published in 1993, four years after the project began [03:42:06]. This pioneering work allowed the simultaneous recording of electrical activity from 50 [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] in freely moving animals, a "neural storm" that revealed how different brain areas interact [03:42:06].

### Brain-Machine Interfaces
The concept of brain-machine interfaces (BMI) emerged from this research, representing another "explosion" in the field [03:42:06]. This technology aims to connect [[Neuroscience and brain function | brains]] to machines, allowing animals to control robots remotely through their thoughts [03:42:06].

Key experiments included:
*   **Rats:** After four years of development, experiments with rats demonstrated the viability of real-time brain-machine communication [03:42:06]. Researchers could predict a rat's movement 150 milliseconds before it occurred by observing the activity of 50 [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] in its motor cortex [03:53:06]. A mouse trained to press a lever for sugary water continued to receive the reward when the lever was removed, simply by imagining the movement, demonstrating the brain's ability to control a robot without physical action [03:54:06]. This research also showed that while many [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] are involved, around 50-100 [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] can provide a statistically reproducible pattern for control, indicating significant redundancy in the brain [03:54:06].
*   **Monkeys (Aurora):** A monkey named Aurora, initially deemed unsuitable for experiments, became a key subject [03:55:06]. By creating a comfortable laboratory environment with Bossa Nova music and football games, Aurora began to thrive [03:56:06]. She was trained to play a complex joystick game to receive orange juice [03:57:06]. The joystick was then disconnected, and Aurora's [[Neuroscience and brain function | brain]] activity was transformed into commands for a robotic arm with seven degrees of freedom and a robotic hand [03:58:06]. Without seeing the robot or moving her body, Aurora learned to control the cursor on the screen and hit targets by mentally imagining the movement, effectively freeing her [[Neuroscience and brain function | brain]] from the physical limits of her body to act at a distance [03:59:06]. This training took approximately three weeks [04:00:06].
*   **Human Patients:** In 2004, a year after the Aurora study, it was demonstrated that BMIs could be used with human patients [04:02:06].
    *   **Parkinson's Patients:** Eleven Parkinson's patients, undergoing deep [[Neuroscience and brain function | brain]] stimulation (DBS) surgery as a last resort, were involved [04:02:06]. While on the operating table, awake patients were asked to move a cursor on a screen, first with a joystick and then by imagination alone [04:02:06]. All patients successfully continued the task mentally, confirming the concept's validity in humans [04:02:06].
    *   **Spinal Cord Injury Patients (Walk Again Project):** This research culminated in the "Walk Again" project, demonstrated at the 2014 World Cup opening [04:02:06]. The goal was to enable paraplegic patients with spinal cord injuries to regain movement using a mind-controlled robotic exoskeleton [04:02:06]. The brain, still functioning normally despite the injury, could send motor commands [04:02:06]. The exoskeleton bypassed the spinal cord injury, decoding the brain's electrical signals into digital commands for the legs and balance [04:02:06].
        > [!info] Sensory Feedback
        > The exoskeleton system included tactile feedback, with sensors on the patient's feet generating electrical signals that were transmitted to vibrators on the forearm [02:02:06]. This allowed patients to feel the texture of the ground, and for patients with high spinal cord injuries (e.g., thoracic), it helped restore the "notion of the body" below the injury, expanding their sense of self to incorporate the paralyzed limb [02:02:06].

        Patients trained with a combination of brain-machine interface, virtual reality, and robotics [02:02:06]. Before the World Cup demonstration, patients reported feeling their legs walking again through virtual reality [02:02:06]. Post-World Cup neurological exams showed that patients were recovering natural sensitivity and even some movement in their lower limbs, suggesting that the intensive training reconnected dormant nerve fibers that survived the original trauma [02:02:06]. This marked the first partial neurological recovery observed in spinal cord injury patients through such a rehabilitation therapy [02:02:06].

## [[Human brain capabilities and limitations | Human Brain Capabilities and Limitations]]
The [[Human brain capabilities and limitations | human brain]] is often described as the most complex known entity in the universe [02:27:06]. It operates on an analog rather than digital logic, allowing for infinite intermediate states between binary ones [03:33:06]. This makes it challenging to replicate or "download" memories like a hard disk [03:34:06].

The speaker highlights six key properties of the [[Human brain capabilities and limitations | human brain]] that have shaped human civilization:
1.  **Ability to Generate Abstractions:** Such as religions, political views, and money [03:36:06].
2.  **Learning from Experience:** The capacity to change continuously based on life experiences, which physically modifies the brain [03:36:06].
3.  **Formation of Large Social Groups:** The ability to unite individuals around an abstraction [03:36:06].
4.  **Mass Communication:** The unique capacity for planetary-level communication [03:36:06].
5.  **Tool and Technology Creation:** Developing tools that expand our sense of being [03:36:06].
6.  **Addictive Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure, which can be addictive (e.g., power) [03:36:06].

### [[Intelligence and cognitive processes | Intelligence]] and Consciousness
The term "Artificial [[Intelligence and cognitive processes | Intelligence]]" is deemed inaccurate, as machines are neither intelligent nor truly artificial; they are creations of [[Human brain capabilities and limitations | human intelligence]] [03:36:06]. [[Intelligence and cognitive processes | Intelligence]] is an emergent property of living organisms, and computers cannot be blamed for their actions as they are only executing programmed tasks [03:36:06].

The speaker notes that digital systems, like social media and video games, are designed to exploit the brain's pleasure circuits, leading to [[understanding_addiction_and_habit_formation_in_neurons | addictive]] behaviors [03:36:06]. This "continuous immersion" in the digital world is causing concerns about declining social interaction skills, increased anxiety, and depression in younger generations [03:36:06].

Consciousness remains the greatest mystery of the universe [03:36:06]. It is believed to be an emergent property of the brain, but its exact nature is not yet scientifically formalized [03:36:06].

### Brain Plasticity and Recovery
The brain's plasticity, its ability to change and adapt, is a crucial factor in recovery from injuries like stroke [02:49:06]. The speaker emphasizes that "old dogs never learn new tricks" is a lie, as [[Neuroscience and brain function | neuroscience]] has categorically denied this [02:49:06]. Even significant brain damage can be compensated for by other areas due to this intense plasticity [02:49:06].

For example, a person with half a brain removed due to Rasmussen syndrome as a child could still function normally in adulthood, demonstrating the brain's extraordinary capacity for recovery [02:49:06].

### Neurodegenerative Diseases
[[Challenges and advancements in understanding Alzheimers disease | Alzheimer's]], Parkinson's, and epilepsy are part of a broader category of neurological and psychiatric diseases affecting billions worldwide [02:49:06].
*   **Epilepsy:** Proposed as a "primordial disease" that might be a common pathway for many neurodegenerative conditions [02:49:06]. Pathological electrical discharges in the brain, or "hypersynchrony" of [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]], could amplify diseases that begin subtly [02:49:06].
*   **Parkinson's:** While DBS is a common surgical alternative for advanced cases, research is exploring less invasive treatments using spinal cord stimulation [02:49:06].
*   **[[Challenges and advancements in understanding Alzheimers disease | Alzheimer's]]**: While [[Neuroscience and brain function | neurons]] cannot yet be resurrected or transplanted, research focuses on postponing neuronal death, improving connectivity of surviving cells, or blocking mechanisms that lead to cell death [02:49:06]. The speaker's specific approach is to block epileptic seizures that may maximize neural death in these diseases [02:49:06].

### Evolution of the Brain
The [[Human brain capabilities and limitations | human brain]] volume has actually decreased over time compared to Neanderthals, whose brains were larger [02:49:06]. However, a larger volume does not necessarily imply greater [[Intelligence and cognitive processes | intelligence]] [02:49:06]. Recent discoveries, such as cave paintings unequivocally created by Neanderthals, challenge previous notions about their cognitive and aesthetic capabilities [02:49:06].

## Societal Implications and Future Concerns
The continuous immersion in the digital world and the rise of "digital homo sapiens" is changing human behaviors, including social interaction, attention span, and cognitive faculties [02:49:06]. This raises concerns about the future of [[Human brain capabilities and limitations | human attributes]] [02:49:06].

> [!warning] Dangers of Digital Control
> The speaker warns against ceding the "governance and control of our lives" to algorithms and applications, as this could lead to a loss of control over personal choices and the emergence of a homogeneous society where behaviors are dictated by programmers [02:49:06]. This control mechanism is already evident in how online data is collected, analyzed, and sold, influencing user choices and transforming individuals into "commodities" [02:49:06].

There is a concern that reality is becoming increasingly blurred with virtual experiences, leading to a point where people may struggle to differentiate between real and virtual life [02:49:06]. This is exacerbated by instant rewards in the virtual world that contrast with the delayed gratification of real life, potentially drawing individuals deeper into virtual spaces [02:49:06].

The speaker also discusses the concept of "brain-to-brain" interfaces, where brain activity from one mouse in Brazil was successfully transmitted to another in the United States, influencing its behavior [02:49:06]. While spontaneous telepathy is not possible due to the tiny magnetic field of the brain, the synchronization of brain activity within social groups (e.g., in a football team or religious gathering) is a documented phenomenon, fostering cohesion [02:49:06]. This is the physiological basis explaining cohesive social groups in primates and other animals [02:49:06].

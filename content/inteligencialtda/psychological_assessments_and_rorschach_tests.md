Psychological assessments and Rorschach tests are crucial tools used to understand the minds of criminals, especially those who commit violent acts against their own families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:49">[01:42:49]</a>. These evaluations help determine if an individual regrets their actions, how they process their crimes, and the likelihood of them re-offending if granted more lenient prison regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:54">[01:42:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>. They also provide insights into the underlying causes of such crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.

## The Rorschach Test

The Rorschach test, often associated with famous criminal cases, is a projective psychological assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>. It consists of ten inkblot cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>. Patients are asked to describe what they see in these images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:07">[01:47:07]</a>. The test is designed to reveal hidden feelings and aspects of a person's personality that they may not wish to disclose directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>.

### Origins
The Rorschach test was developed by a psychiatrist who had brothers with mental disorders that made them violent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. He sought to understand their behavior by studying violent patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:10">[01:48:10]</a>. The test's concept originated when a patient accidentally spilled paint on a white card, creating a stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:31">[01:48:31]</a>. Observers interpreted this random stain in various ways, leading to the realization that different people saw different things, and specific patterns of perception could be associated with violent or non-violent tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:49:05]</a>. This method is endorsed by the National Council of Psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>.

### Administration and Interpretation
A qualified psychologist administers the Rorschach test, which typically lasts about two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:41">[01:46:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>. Two psychologists are usually involved: one to apply the test and another to evaluate it without prior contact or knowledge of the patient's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:41">[01:55:41]</a>. The evaluator meticulously records what the patient sees and delivers a report for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:51">[01:55:51]</a>. Specialists in this field often undergo two years of specialized training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:04">[01:56:04]</a>.

The test takes into account not only what a person sees but also where on the card they see it, how close they hold it, and if they turn the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:06">[01:57:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:12">[01:57:12]</a>. For each figure, there can be thousands of possible interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:57">[01:56:57]</a>. Difficulty in interpreting the images can also be a significant sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:29">[01:51:29]</a>.

### Case Studies: Suzane von Richthofen and Elize Matsunaga
[[Psychopathy and criminal behavior | Suzane von Richthofen]]'s repeated failures in the Rorschach test prevented her release from prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:07">[01:55:07]</a>. Initially, she would express superficial regret, focusing on how the crime harmed *her* life, career, and family prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>. She would not acknowledge the impact on her parents' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>. After realizing her mistake in previous tests, she would adapt her answers to express remorse for her parents' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>. However, psychologists consistently diagnosed her as manipulative, seductive, narcissistic, and self-centered, with camouflaged aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:03">[01:58:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:09">[01:58:09]</a>. They concluded that her aggression could become externalized if she faced demands or environmental pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:35">[01:58:35]</a>.

Suzane's high degree of manipulation and seduction was so profound that she could even manipulate the evaluators themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:27">[02:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:27">[02:07:27]</a>. She would greet psychologists warmly, offering them comfort, and even compliment their youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:25">[02:06:25]</a>. This behavior, seen as a form of seduction and manipulation, could inadvertently affect the test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:39">[02:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:27">[02:07:27]</a>.

In contrast, [[Psychopathy and Brain Functioning | Elize Matsunaga]] has two certifications of [[Psychopathy and Brain Functioning | psychopathy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:42">[02:07:42]</a>. Her complete lack of emotional response after her crime, such as drinking coffee normally and ordering bed sheets changed the morning after dismembering her husband, was a clear indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a>. She also showed no remorse during therapy sessions, instead regretting her husband's infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>.

### Secrecy and Public Interest
Psychological reports for criminals like Suzane and Elize are typically kept confidential to protect the privacy and professional secrecy of psychologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:49">[01:38:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. However, as public figures who committed crimes that shocked the nation, their cases are often considered exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:26">[01:40:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>. The law of criminal execution has a principle of publicity, meaning that society has a right to monitor the execution of a sentence, especially when the crime was against society itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:13">[01:41:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>. These reports help society understand the risks involved when such individuals are released back into the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:21">[01:43:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>.

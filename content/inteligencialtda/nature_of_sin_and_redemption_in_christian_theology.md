Christian theology extensively discusses the **nature of sin and redemption**, with different interpretations emerging from the Protestant Reformation, specifically [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism and Arminianism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:30">[07:54:30]</a>.

## The Nature of Sin

From a theological perspective, human beings are inherently affected by sin.
The concept of "total depravity" in [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism]] signifies that humanity was fully impacted by the Fall, affecting reason, emotion, and volition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. There is no human being who is not a sinner after the Fall; all are born in sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

Evil, therefore, is not primarily external but internal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. Power, for example, does not corrupt an individual, but rather reveals the corruption already within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. To assert that man is inherently good, as philosophers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau suggested, is considered a mistake in this theological framework; man is essentially bad unless transformed by God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

### Free Will vs. Free Agency

A key distinction in this discussion is between free will and free agency:
*   **Free Will:** The power to choose good and practice it in its fullness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. According to [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism]], only Adam possessed true free will before the Fall, meaning he could choose not to sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. Post-Fall humanity, however, cannot choose not to sin because of an inherent inclination towards error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>.
*   **Free Agency:** The ability to choose one's paths, such as choosing between left or right, or whether to travel or stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:50]</a>. This capacity remains for humans, but it does not equate to the ability to avoid sin entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

From the Calvinist perspective, man, without divine intervention, is spiritually dead, likened to a corpse in a morgue (Greek: *necros*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>. Thus, a dead person cannot choose to act or react towards spiritual matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>.

## The Concept of Redemption

[[Christianity and redemption | Redemption]] is presented as a divine work, not a human one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.
It is planned by God, executed by God, and consummated by God, ensuring that the glory belongs solely to God, not to man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. Consequently, individuals do not "find Christ"; rather, Christ finds them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.

### Calvinist Perspective on Salvation

Key tenets of [[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Calvinism]] regarding [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]] and [[christianity_forgiveness_and_salvation | forgiveness]] include:
*   **Unconditional Election:** God chooses man, initiating the love that leads to salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. Human love for God is a response to God's prior love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Atonement (or Particular Redemption):** Christ's work on the cross was not merely to *make possible* salvation for everyone, but to *effectively save* His chosen church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
*   **Irresistible Grace (or Effective Vocation):** When God calls, the call is effective and cannot be resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. "My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
*   **Perseverance of the Saints:** A truly saved person's salvation is guaranteed by God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. Once a child of God, always a child of God, even in sin; disciplinary treatment may occur, but sonship remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. The joy of salvation may be lost, but not salvation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

Even though God's sovereignty is central, human responsibility is not nullified. God requires repentance and belief, but it is God who grants repentance and saving faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>. When an individual chooses to believe, it is because God has worked in them to create that desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>. No one can claim they were not chosen if they desired salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>.

### Arminian Perspective on Salvation

[[concepts_of_calvinism_and_arminianism | Arminianism]], originating from Jacobus Arminius, differs by asserting that:
*   Man is not totally depraved to the point of being unable to choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
*   Man has the capacity to make a choice regarding salvation and has free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.
*   Man can choose to accept or reject salvation, holding the "reins" or control of their decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>.

### The Purpose of Life

The Christian worldview posits that life is not pointless but has a purpose: to glorify God and enjoy Him forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:31:00">[51:31:00]</a>. This purpose transcends material wealth, fame, or professional success, as these things, while gifts from God, cannot fill the "void" of eternity that God has placed in the human heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:54:00">[53:54:00]</a>. Only God can satisfy this void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[54:04:00]</a>.

### The Problem of Evil

Evil in the world is understood as a consequence of sin, which broke the harmony between humanity and God, others, oneself, and nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:47:00">[54:47:00]</a>.

## Aspects of Redemption and Salvation

### Christ's Atonement and Justification
The death of Christ on the cross is described as a "vicarious, substitute" death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>. Jesus did not die as a mere martyr but suffered for humanity's sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>. This is the essence of [[christianity_and_redemption | Christianity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.

Justification by faith, a core doctrine of the Reformation, means that upon believing in Jesus, three key "transactions" occur on the cross in one's favor:
1.  **Imputation of Sin to Christ:** God does not charge a believer's immense debt of sin to their account but imputes it to Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09">[01:25:09]</a>.
2.  **Cancellation of Debt:** Christ "tore up" and "cancelled" this debt, declaring it "paid" (Greek: *tetelestai*) on the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>.
3.  **Imputation of Christ's Righteousness:** God credits the "infinite credit of Justice of Christ" to the believer's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:32">[01:26:32]</a>.

Justification is "more than forgiveness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:28">[01:27:28]</a>. While forgiveness is a negative concept (debt removed), justification is a positive concept (infinite credit of righteousness deposited) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>. God is "faithful and just" to forgive because Christ has already paid the penalty for sins on the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>.

### Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit
The sin against the Holy Spirit is considered unforgivable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:50">[02:56:50]</a>. This occurs when someone consciously and deliberately attributes a work of Jesus, performed by the power of the Holy Spirit, to Satan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:32">[02:57:32]</a>. Such a person is seen as having a hardened heart, without remorse or doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:46">[02:57:46]</a>.

### Revelation and Responsibility
God reveals Himself in four ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>:
1.  **Creation:** The invisible attributes of God are known through the things He created, making humanity inexcusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
2.  **Conscience:** God has placed a moral court within every human being, giving a sense of right and wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
3.  **Scriptures:** The written Word of God.
4.  **Jesus Christ:** The ultimate revelation.

Natural revelation (creation and conscience) is sufficient to hold people accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. However, the Gospel (special revelation) is necessary to lead individuals to [[christianity_forgiveness_and_salvation | salvation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Ignorance is not a path to heaven; otherwise, the best missionary strategy would be to keep people ignorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Salvation of Children and Special Needs Individuals
Children who die before reaching an age of reason, or individuals with special health problems that prevent cognitive development, are believed to be regenerated and saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This is based on the belief that God is never caught by surprise and that regeneration is a secret, intimate work of the Holy Spirit in which humans have no conscious participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. While all are born in sin, these individuals are considered innocent in terms of malice, though not impeccability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. There is no specific "age of accountability" defined in scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Repentance vs. Remorse
Repentance (Greek: *metanoia*) involves three elements that complete a cycle: reason, emotion, and will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Remorse, however, only includes the recognition of a mistake and sadness for it, but lacks the will to turn and rectify the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:14">[01:51:14]</a>. An example is Judas, who felt remorse but did not repent, leading to suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>. Peter, on the other hand, denied Jesus but repented and was forgiven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>.

### The Thief on the Cross
The story of the thief on the cross crucified alongside Jesus illustrates several points about [[the_theological_significance_of_salvation_and_grace | salvation]]:
*   **Not by Works:** The thief could not perform good works to earn salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:28">[01:52:28]</a>.
*   **Not by Religious Rites:** He could not be baptized or attend church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:37">[01:53:37]</a>.
*   **Exclusively by Grace:** Salvation is an expression of God's grace, not human merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:08">[01:54:08]</a>.
*   **Received Immediately:** At the moment of belief, salvation is received, as Jesus told the thief, "Today you will be with me in paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:18">[01:54:18]</a>.

### Redemption for those before Christ
Those who lived before Christ were saved by believing in the Messiah who was to come, the Christ of prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Jesus is presented as the central figure of the Old and New Testaments, represented by various symbols and prophecies throughout scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>. Salvation has always been exclusively through Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:39">[02:59:39]</a>.

### The Importance of Forgiveness
Forgiveness is presented as essential for personal well-being. It is described as greater than hatred, capable of healing and freeing the individual. It cleanses the soul, purifies the mind, and calms the heart, even when the pain of an event may still linger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:49">[03:02:49]</a>.

The role of media and public perception significantly influences criminal cases, from the initial investigation to trial outcomes and the public's understanding of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This influence is observed in various aspects, including public pressure on trials, media focus, and how narratives shape understanding of legal proceedings.

## Media's Role in High-Profile Cases

Cases that gain significant "repercussion" in the press often demand more attention from law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Journalist Ulisses Campbell notes that the release of his book on Flordelis was delayed due to trial postponements, necessitating a rewrite to avoid prejudicing the case by labeling her a "murderer" or "mastermind" before conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This highlights the careful line that [[The role of media and literature in shaping perceptions of crime and criminals | authors]] must walk when reporting on ongoing legal matters.

Delegate Mauro Dias observed that during the investigation of high-profile cases, the press often creates pressure, making the police's job more challenging due to constant scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. He mentions that "time is the greatest enemy of the harvest evidence" in investigations, and constant media presence can impede the quick collection of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

### Focus on Sensationalism

The media often prioritizes cases that involve family members or unusual circumstances, neglecting thousands of other serious crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. As one delegate lamented, cases of "son who killed the father, real father who killed his son, son who killed his father" in less affluent areas like Capão Redondo or Paraisópolis rarely receive media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. This selective coverage by [[Media representation of crime | the media]] can distort [[impact_of_media_portrayal_on_public_perception_of_crimes | public perception]] of crime frequency and severity across different social strata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.

## Influence on Judicial Proceedings

### Jury Court vs. Judge

In Brazil, cases of robbery-homicide (latrocinium) do not go to the Jury Court, unlike crimes against life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Mauro Dias believes this is "nonsense" because a Jury Court, comprised of seven jurors, is more likely to issue a severe sentence, as jurors directly see graphic evidence of the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. A judge in a common court, despite having access to the same files, may render a "lighter" sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Public Pressure and Verdicts

High-profile cases often experience immense public and media pressure, which can influence the outcome of trials. In the Nardoni case, the prosecutor felt "so much pressure... from the media society" that they believed a very high sentence was necessary, otherwise, the "population was in front of the forum... pushing the grid to want to invade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Ulisses Campbell argues that judges are "much more comfortable" and "feel much more exempt" when issuing sentences in private, rather than in a Jury Court where the public's emotional response is palpable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.

The Nardoni case is cited as a prime example of how [[Public perceptions and controversies | popular jury pressure]], amplified by [[Role and impact of media in shaping public opinion | media attention]], can influence verdicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>. The couple was convicted of a crime without "irrefutable proof," suggesting that public sentiment may have played a role in the conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

Conversely, a confessed defendant in a Belém do Pará case, who murdered his wife, was acquitted by a jury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. The defense lawyer strategically used the presence of the couple's eight children, appealing to the jury's emotions by arguing that the children would lose both parents if the father was incarcerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>. This demonstrates how a skilled defense can manipulate [[the_impact_of_fame_and_media_attention | public empathy]] in a jury setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>.

### Legal Technicalities and Public Opinion

Legal processes can be highly technical. For instance, the autopsy report in one case stated death by asphyxia, a qualifier for homicide that would increase the sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. However, the defense successfully "broke this thesis" by presenting expert testimony that the victim died from a gunshot to the head, thereby removing the asphyxia qualifier and reducing the potential sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. This illustrates how expert testimony, rather than public opinion, can significantly impact trial outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.

## Public Consumption of True Crime

There is a significant public fascination with true crime stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:41">[03:19:41]</a>. Ulisses Campbell notes that podcasts and interviews about his books on criminal cases garner millions of views, far outstripping actual book sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:58">[03:15:58]</a>. This suggests that people are drawn to these stories for entertainment and curiosity, often preferring digestible formats like podcasts or series over detailed books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:58">[03:15:58]</a>.

This fascination also extends to unusual forms of support for criminals. For example, some people send "hundreds and hundreds of letters" to convicted serial killers, expressing a desire to marry them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:42">[03:14:42]</a>. There's even a market for items associated with famous criminals, such as buying the car used to transport a body in a murder case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>. This unusual behavior highlights the complex and sometimes disturbing nature of public engagement with high-profile crimes.

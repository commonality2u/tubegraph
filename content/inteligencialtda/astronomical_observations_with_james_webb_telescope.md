The [[Current and future space missions | James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST) is a relatively new and highly advanced piece of equipment that began scientific operations in July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:02">[02:26:02]</a>. Its primary objective is to investigate how the first galaxies formed, aiming to push beyond the observational limits of its predecessor, the [[Current and future space missions | Hubble Space Telescope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>.

## Hubble Deep Field and its Predecessors

The decision to point the [[Current and future space missions | Hubble Space Telescope]] at a specific "deep field" region was not arbitrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. This area had already been extensively studied for many years using ground-based telescopes like the 48-inch Smith CG telescope at the [[Black holes and astronomy | Palomar Observatory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. Astronomers, even before Hubble, expected to find galaxies in these "dark regions" of the sky, though the exact number or distance was unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. Hubble's observations confirmed these theoretical predictions, providing observational verification of distance calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.

## James Webb's Initial Findings and Challenges to Models

Upon the initial release of [[Current and future space missions | James Webb]] images, there was widespread excitement about discovering the most distant galaxies in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. However, subsequent spectroscopic analysis (which measures the light spectrum to determine composition and redshift/distance) revealed that many of these initial "red dots" were "imposter galaxies" â€“ much closer than initially estimated by photo astrometry (photographic analysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. This was attributed to the presence of significant dust within these galaxies, making them appear redder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.

Despite these initial adjustments, [[Current and future space missions | James Webb]] continues to reveal galaxies at very early stages of the universe, with the furthest confirmed candidate being around 330-340 million years after the [[Astrophysics and the universe | Big Bang]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>.

The observations from [[Current and future space missions | James Webb]] have posed significant challenges to the prevailing [[Astrophysics and the universe | Big Bang model]]:
*   **Mature Galaxies:** The model predicted that early galaxies should be small, proto-galaxies, colliding and merging to form larger structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>. However, [[Current and future space missions | James Webb]] is observing structured, massive, and fully functional galaxies, including spiral galaxies, in the early universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.
*   **Heavy Elements:** Early universe models predict a composition primarily of hydrogen and helium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a>. Yet, [[Current and future space missions | James Webb]] detects "metallic" (heavy) chemical elements like vanadium, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen in these very early galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>. These elements are traditionally thought to form through successive explosions of stars (supernovae) over generations, which would take billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>.
*   **Supermassive Black Holes:** The presence of supermassive [[Black holes and astronomy | black holes]] within early galaxies, such as the HD1 galaxy (which potentially houses a black hole 100 million times the mass of the Sun, much larger than the Milky Way's at 4.5 million solar masses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:08">[02:44:08]</a>, is unexpected. These are believed to take billions of years to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>.
*   **Absence of Population III Stars:** Theoretical models predict the existence of Population III stars, which are hypothesized to be the first stars composed solely of hydrogen and helium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:19">[01:28:19]</a>. However, these have never been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>.
*   **Universe Homogeneity:** The [[Astrophysics and the universe | Big Bang model]] requires an "inflation" period where the universe expanded faster than the speed of light to explain its observed homogeneity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. Critics argue this is an "ad hoc" explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:36">[03:02:36]</a>.

These unexpected findings have led some cosmologists to suggest a need to "rewrite [[Astrophysics and the universe | astronomy]] and [[Astrophysics and the universe | cosmology]] books" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:49">[01:14:49]</a>, causing a "revolution" and "earthquake" in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. Some argue that the [[Astrophysics and the universe | Big Bang model]] is constantly being adjusted to fit new data, rather than making successful predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.

## The Nature of Scientific Models

A key aspect of scientific discussion, particularly in [[Astrophysics and the universe | cosmology]], is the concept of a "model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>. A model is a mental image or representation, often incorporating probability, that is based on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. It is understood that a model is not the "reality" itself; if it were perfectly accurate, it would cease to be a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:15">[01:53:15]</a>.

The [[Astrophysics and the universe | Big Bang]] is considered a model, or more specifically, a hypothesis among several for explaining the universe's beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. It proposes an initial dense, compact state where everything already exists, focusing on how it evolves over time, rather than explaining creation from nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.

A scientific model must be falsifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>. For instance, the prediction of [[Astrophysics and the universe | cosmic microwave background]] radiation by George Gamow and his students was a falsifiable prediction of the [[Astrophysics and the universe | Big Bang]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:38">[02:11:38]</a>. The principle of an isotropic (equal in all directions) universe is another core assumption of the [[Astrophysics and the universe | Big Bang model]]; finding a break in isotropy on a large scale could falsify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:25">[02:31:25]</a>.

When new data, like that from [[Current and future space missions | James Webb]], emerges, models are often updated or refined. This process of adjusting a model to new data is considered a healthy part of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:15">[02:00:15]</a>.

## Dark Ages and the Evolution of the Universe

Within the [[Astrophysics and the universe | Big Bang model]], there is a period known as the "Dark Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:16">[01:54:16]</a>. This era is theorized to have begun around 380,000 years after the [[Astrophysics and the universe | Big Bang]], after the [[Astrophysics and the universe | cosmic microwave background]] was produced, and would have lasted until the formation of the first stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>. The term "Dark Ages" stems from the absence of known light sources in this period, making it a period of "unknowns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.

The search for the "first stars" and the end of the Dark Ages is ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:50">[01:55:50]</a>. Advancements in observational technology, such as the upcoming generation of 30-meter telescopes (TMT, GMT, ELT), are expected to provide a significant leap in [[Astrophysics and the universe | astronomy]], potentially allowing for the observation of these earliest stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:14">[01:50:14]</a>.

## Ongoing Research and Future Outlook

[[Current and future space missions | James Webb]] has completed its first cycle of research, which involved pointing the telescope at already known objects for calibration and familiarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:10">[02:26:10]</a>. The selection of projects for Cycle 2 has concluded, with many focusing on investigating galaxies with redshift (z) greater than 10, aiming to acquire spectra for these galaxies to confirm their distances and properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:55">[02:26:55]</a>. This includes re-analyzing galaxies like GL-z12, which was re-studied and placed at a redshift of 13.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:57">[02:28:57]</a>. Future cycles will continue to utilize different instruments on [[Current and future space missions | James Webb]] (e.g., NearCam for near-infrared, Miri for mid-infrared) to gather more comprehensive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:06">[02:29:06]</a>.

Scientists acknowledge that the field of [[Astrophysics and the universe | astronomy]] is observation-based, meaning progress is often tied to technological limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:44">[02:00:44]</a>. New equipment leads to new discoveries, which can sometimes challenge existing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:05">[02:09:05]</a>. However, not finding something does not necessarily mean it doesn't exist, only that it hasn't been observed yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:10">[02:11:10]</a>.

The ongoing observations from [[Current and future space missions | James Webb]] continue to drive active debate and research in [[Astrophysics and the universe | cosmology]], particularly regarding the formation of early galaxies and the universe's evolution.

Cris Paiva is a comedian known for her observational humor, often drawing from personal experiences such as her past relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. She has a strong presence in the Brazilian comedy scene and is involved in various media projects.

## Early Life and Path to Comedy

Cris Paiva decided at 15 that she would have a daughter named Mariana when she turned 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. This decision influenced her career path, as she sought a profession that would allow her to work part-time and raise her daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. Despite not initially wanting to be a teacher and not feeling she had a "gift" for it, she pursued pedagogy because it offered the flexibility she desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. Her parents were also teachers, providing a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. She studied pedagogy at Unesp after passing a public exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a> and taught for ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>.

She enjoyed aspects of teaching, particularly observing child development and connecting with students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. However, she believes teaching requires a specific gift she didn't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

Cris's first stand-up comedy performance was in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. She describes herself as very shy, especially in person, but manages to perform by ignoring the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

## Personal Experiences as Comedy Material

### Relationship and Breakup

A significant portion of Cris Paiva's comedy is inspired by her past relationship, particularly her breakup, which she describes as "surreal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>.

Cris had been with a comedian for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>. She handled the finances and decision-making in the relationship, viewing herself as the "man of the relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Her ex-partner once told her he needed to find a "dumb woman" because he "couldn't argue" with her, finding her "very smart" and difficult to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

Before the breakup, her ex-partner took a board game they used to play together, but left the box, as it didn't fit in his suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The game's illustrations were done by Weberson Santiago, a friend and former student of Cris's, now working in Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>.

The breakup occurred around New Year's Eve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. Her ex-partner told her he was traveling to visit his "sick father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. Cris spent New Year's quietly at her mother's house, believing her father-in-law was ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>. The next day, she saw a photo of him at a New Year's Eve party with another woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. When she called him, he hung up and sent a WhatsApp message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He then called back, stating he had 6% battery, and confirmed he was with someone else, adding, "I'm very happy but I'm not married to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. This happened after he had been with the new person for over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>.

After the conversation, Cris told him "Happy New Year" and hung up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. Her initial thought was that it was a prank or a coded message indicating he was kidnapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57">[01:50:57]</a>. Two days later, he was posting photos with the new woman, acting as if nothing had happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>.

### Post-Breakup and Recovery

Cris managed household expenses and continued to pay bills while her ex-partner traveled with his new girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:01">[02:32:01]</a>. He returned to their house to collect more belongings, including a notebook and passport, and then disappeared again for Carnival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:01">[02:32:01]</a>. The rent was in his name, making it difficult for Cris to cancel it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:07">[02:33:07]</a>.

Eventually, Cris and her daughter moved to her mother's house, taking only clothes, some board games, and their personal items, waiting for him to resolve the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:07">[02:33:07]</a>. While at a wedding, she received a call from her dog-sitter, who informed her that her ex-partner was moving all their furniture and belongings out of the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. He took everything, including the couch, refrigerator, stove, and even pillowcases, leaving the house empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Her daughter's request to see the dog was met with a suggestion to "look for a lawyer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>.

Cris describes her January after the breakup as "shitty," leading to crying exhaustion and a 9kg weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a>. She recovered quickly, feeling liberated professionally and emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:58">[03:09:58]</a>. She views the breakup as a "garbage truck" cleaning her street and is "extremely grateful" to the other woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:39">[03:11:39]</a>.

### "Separation Text" and Stand-Up

Her personal story of separation became her most anticipated stand-up text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:58">[03:56:58]</a>. She already had some jokes about the "dirty details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:58">[03:56:58]</a>. The challenge was finding the right tone so the audience would laugh rather than feel pity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:58">[03:56:58]</a>. This "separation text" video, titled "Cris Paiva," with her in a black dress and bee socks, gained significant traction online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:58">[03:56:58]</a>.

## Comedy Philosophy and Industry Views

### "Comedy as a Big Company Without Walls"

Cris views comedy as a "big company without walls" where people can work together without needing permission from anyone to create or perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. She believes no one should dictate another's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. She feels her ex-partner "burned bridges" and "is no longer part of this great company" due to his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

### Women in Comedy and Industry Dynamics

Cris believes the stand-up environment has always been very inclusive and welcoming for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:02">[03:44:02]</a>. She asserts that gender should not be a factor in opportunities; talent should be the priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:11">[03:51:11]</a>. She is critical of quotas or mandates for female representation, arguing that focusing on numbers rather than merit can lead to less experienced comedians being put on stage prematurely, which can negatively impact the audience's perception of women in comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. She compares it to national cinema, where low-quality films can make audiences generalize that all national cinema is bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:18">[05:18:18]</a>.

Cris says she has never felt a need for special treatment as a woman in comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:02">[03:44:02]</a>. She suggests that women who are "good on stage" will be called, regardless of gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:11">[04:17:11]</a>.

### Political Humor and Neutrality

Cris advocates for comedians to attack both sides of the political spectrum rather than choosing an ideological side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:41">[03:39:41]</a>. She believes that when comedians align with one side, it loses the essence of comedy, which is to "hit everything" and "always have a target" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:10">[04:19:10]</a>. She found herself in a situation where a political humor piece she was in became too extreme to the right, leading her to leave because she didn't agree with only attacking one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.

She expresses frustration with "worshipers" or "radicals" on both the left and right who attack those with differing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:55">[05:54:55]</a>. She believes people should judge politicians based on their actions and promises, not just their party affiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:07">[06:31:07]</a>. She also criticizes the "cancel culture" mentality, where people try to "cancel" others they disagree with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:55">[05:54:55]</a>.

### The "Fry" (Roast Battle) and Joke Ethics

Cris discusses the "fry" or roast battle format, explaining it as a show where comedians "speak badly" about a guest until they cry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:53">[05:51:53]</a>. She emphasizes that it is a joke format, not an actual offense, based on an agreement among participants to accept the jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:53">[05:51:53]</a>. She mentions that some jokes, even if personal, are part of the show and are not meant as genuine attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:53">[05:51:53]</a>.

## Current Projects and Outlook

She is also involved in a new podcast project with Yasmin Yassine, intended to be a video podcast with two female hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:30">[02:57:30]</a>. The podcast aims for natural, light conversations on any topic, not just "feminine" subjects like menstruation or lipstick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:30">[02:57:30]</a>.

[[The impact of terrorism as a political force | Hamas]], or Ramas as referred to in the transcript, emerged as a military confrontation strategy against the State of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>. It is a political organization that also implements military confrontation tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

## Origins and Ideology

[[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] was born in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>, emerging as a result of the First Intifada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:46">[01:59:46]</a>. Its formation stemmed from a relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:58">[01:48:58]</a>. The organization's ideological basis is rooted in the Muslim Brotherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:05">[02:14:05]</a>.

The founding charter of [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] explicitly states its goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. For [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]], the conflict with Israel is religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>. Its charter states that [[Israel | Israel]] will exist until Islam obliterates it, similar to previous obliterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. It also states that "our struggle against Jews is very big and very serious, she needs all the effort sincere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. The organization's website, hamas.ps, clearly states: "our fight against the Jews is eternal and has to last forever until the day of Resurrection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>. This is seen as a fight against the Jewish people, not against [[imperialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:29">[02:13:29]</a>.

[[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] is fundamentally against the existence of [[Israel | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a> and rejects a two-state solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. It is not in favor of dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>, and seeks the establishment of an Islamic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:09">[02:24:09]</a>.

## Political and Military Actions

After its emergence, [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] began to dispute political hegemony with [[Israel | Fatah]], the then-leader of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization | Palestine Liberation Organization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:51">[01:59:51]</a>. In 2006, [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] won the elections across [[Palestine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:11">[02:14:11]</a>. It became hegemonic in Gaza, though not in the West Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. Since 2007, [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] has managed the government in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:25">[02:18:25]</a>.

The organization's military actions have included suicide attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:32">[01:58:32]</a> and rocket phenomena dating back to 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:32">[02:11:32]</a>. In 2014, [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] rockets hit electric plants in Gaza, which have since remained unrepaired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:55">[02:19:55]</a>.

The actions of [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] on October 7th, such as targeting civilians, are defined as [[The impact of terrorism as a political force | terrorism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>. These actions are compared to those of [[The impact of terrorism as a political force | Islamic State]] and [[The impact of terrorism as a political force | Al-Qaeda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>. The *Palestinian president* has stated that [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] does not represent the Palestinian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:47">[02:05:47]</a>.

## International Stance and Criticisms

The international community, including organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, considers [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] to be an organization with specific conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:50">[02:27:50]</a>. Brazil's government does not have negotiations with [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:55">[02:29:55]</a>.

It is argued that [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] is used by the Zionist state as an excuse for its actions, implying that if [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] didn't exist, other organizations would be similarly labeled "terrorists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

### Responses to [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]]'s Actions

Following the October 7th attack, the ongoing situation is described as a "massacre" rather than a war, given the disproportionate use of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. The death of civilians is condemned unequivocally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. The violence committed by [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] is seen as moving the Israeli population further away from the possibility of coexistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:09">[01:59:09]</a>.

The blockade on Gaza, transforming it into the "largest open-air prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>, is stated to be a consequence of [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] winning elections and not recognizing past agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:47">[02:10:47]</a>. This measure, also applied by Egypt, is seen as a protective measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:43">[02:13:43]</a>. It's noted that [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] stole kerosene from a hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:40">[02:23:40]</a> and used water pipes from Gaza to build rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:29">[02:17:29]</a>.

It is asserted that while [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]]'s actions are unforgivable and represent terrorism, they do not bring peace closer to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:04">[02:05:04]</a>. The Palestinian cause needs to separate and distance itself from [[Hamas and its influence | Hamas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:51">[02:05:51]</a>.

His performances are dynamic, incorporating various artistic talents beyond traditional [[standup_comedy_in_Brazil | stand-up]].

## Early Stand-up Approach
Initially, [[igor_guimares_his_career_and_trajectory | Igor Guimarães]] found traditional [[standup_comedy_in_Brazil | stand-up]] challenging. He recalls trying a "classic" joke format where he would set up a joke and wait for laughter, but it "didn't work out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. He found it difficult to talk for extended periods by himself, describing himself as "very schizophrenic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a> and speaking loudly in his early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. This led him to involve other comedians in his shows, believing it offered a "better experience" for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

## Character-Driven Comedy
A cornerstone of [[igor_guimares_his_career_and_trajectory | Igor Guimarães]]'s comedy is his array of distinctive characters. He often describes his home as being decorated with themes for each of his characters, with "each room in my house is a character of mine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Examples include:
*   **The Josias puppet** – A character prominently featured, including in his tenure at Pânico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. He mentioned that the Josias puppet allowed for greater creative freedom, as the puppet could say "absurd" things without directly being attributed to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.
*   **Lawyer Paloma** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>
*   **Indiana Jones** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a> (associated with his kitchen)
*   **Goofy** – Another puppet character, often performing alongside Josias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.

His solo shows were described as a "mix of characters" where he would showcase "everything I knew how to do with my curicas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This included quick costume changes and interacting with pre-recorded videos of other characters to allow for transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

## Improvisation and Audience Interaction

He enjoys the dynamic of putting "people in the text, take people out, little line, boot shoe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. This improvisational style ensures that even when he uses a pre-written text, there is always "something new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>. He prefers live performances where audience reactions generate new material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

## Unconventional Humor and Themes

He recounts jokes involving "voice from a prison, half sick with cancer, a train, organ theft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>, delivered through characters like the Josias puppet to make such "heavy" topics more palatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. He appreciates this type of humor, stating, "I still like this type of humor I don't know why it's missing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

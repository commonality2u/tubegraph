The realm of [[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | technology]] has significantly advanced, impacting various aspects of human life and pushing the boundaries of what is considered possible, particularly in neuroscience and human-machine interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.

## The Human Brain as a New Frontier
Historically, the future was imagined with flying cars, spaceships, and teleportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. However, technology has evolved in unexpected directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. The human brain is now considered the new frontier in scientific exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

Neuroscience as a scientific research discipline is relatively young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. It was revolutionized by Santiago Ramón y Cajal at the beginning of the 20th century, who used microscopes to observe neurons and proposed the existence of spaces between cells (synapses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. Ramón y Cajal, despite not speaking German, the lingua franca of biology in Europe at the time, published his detailed drawings of neural circuits in a Spanish magazine, eventually leading to a shared Nobel Prize in 1906 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

## Brain-Machine Interface (BMI)
A significant breakthrough in neuroscience is the [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | Brain-Machine Interface]] (BMI). The concept of connecting a brain to a machine to control a robot remotely was initially envisioned as early as the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. This idea involved reading the electrical "storm" from the brain and transforming it into digital commands for a robotic arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. The term "brain-machine interface" was coined during a conversation in a restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.

### Key Experiments and Demonstrations
*   **Rodent Experiments**: Early experiments involved rats learning to press a lever for water. When the lever was removed, the rat's brain activity (imagining the movement) was sent to a robot that delivered water, demonstrating control by thought alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.
*   **Aurora the Monkey**: A pivotal experiment involved a monkey named Aurora who learned to control a robotic arm remotely using only her thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>. This demonstrated that a primate brain could free itself from the physical limits of its body to act at a distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>.
*   **Human Trials**: In 2004, a year after Aurora's work, the concept was demonstrated in human patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. Eleven Parkinson's patients, undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a last resort, were able to mentally move a cursor on a screen, even without physical interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.

### Exoskeleton for Paraplegics
The team later proposed creating a robotic suit (exoskeleton) controlled by the mind for paralyzed individuals with spinal cord injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. The brain's motor commands, normally interrupted by the injury, would be decoded by a computer system and transformed into digital commands for the exoskeleton's legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>.

This concept was publicly demonstrated at the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. A paraplegic patient, Juliano Pinto, performed the ceremonial first kick using a mind-controlled exoskeleton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>. Beyond enabling movement, this brain-machine interface training led to unexpected partial neurological recovery, including the return of natural sensitivity and some voluntary movement below the injury level, suggesting that dormant neural connections were re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.

### Brain-to-Brain Interface
In 2013, the first brain-to-brain interface was demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:33">[02:35:33]</a>. Brain activity from a mouse in Brazil, making a decision, was transmitted to a mouse in the United States, enabling the second mouse to make the correct choice above chance level, showing a form of direct communication between brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:21">[02:36:21]</a>. This proof of concept was later replicated with human beings using non-invasive methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>, though true spontaneous telepathy is not possible due to the brain's tiny magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:38">[02:37:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:08">[02:38:08]</a>.

## Concerns Regarding [[Artificial intelligence and its impact on society | Artificial Intelligence and its impact on society]]
The increasing immersion in the [[Artificial Intelligence and its impact on society | digital]] world raises concerns about its impact on human behavior and cognitive faculties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:23">[02:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:07">[02:18:07]</a>.

### Misconceptions of "Artificial Intelligence"
The term "[[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | Artificial Intelligence]]" is deemed problematic because such systems are neither truly intelligent nor artificial; they are creations of human intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:15">[01:41:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>. Intelligence is considered an emergent property of living organisms, and digital systems lack human attributes like intuition, creativity, ethics, and aesthetic sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:34">[01:34:34]</a>. The human brain operates in an analog fashion, with infinite intermediate states, unlike binary digital logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:56">[01:36:56]</a>. This means complex human concepts like beauty cannot be programmed into an algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:39">[01:35:39]</a>.

### The "Singularity"
The concept of a "singularity," a moment where machines would supplant human beings, is dismissed as not happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:28">[01:32:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>. Some proponents of [[Artificial Intelligences Impact on Employment and Society | Artificial Intelligence]] even advocate for brain-machine interfaces as a defense against a perceived threat from AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:06">[01:43:06]</a>.

### [[Effects of technology on intelligence and attention | Effects of technology on intelligence and attention]]
Modern digital systems, like smartphones and video games, are designed to penetrate and exploit the brain's limbic circuit, which is responsible for pleasure and reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:06">[02:05:06]</a>. This can lead to addictive behaviors, prolonged screen time, and a decrease in real-world interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:45">[02:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:38">[02:05:38]</a>.

Concerns include:
*   **Behavioral changes**: People crossing streets without looking, engrossed in their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:06">[02:19:06]</a>.
*   **Cognitive impact**: Difficulty concentrating on reading long texts due to constant hyperlink clicking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:51">[02:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>.
*   **Social interaction**: Reduced social interaction and an increase in anxiety, distress, and depression among young people who spend excessive hours online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:52">[02:20:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:53">[02:20:53]</a>.
*   **Loss of basic skills**: Decreased ability to remember phone numbers or navigate without GPS, relying entirely on external devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:59">[02:24:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>.
*   **Manipulation and control**: Algorithms dictate choices (e.g., Netflix suggestions, Spotify playlists), risking the loss of human free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:15">[02:27:15]</a>.
*   **Data commodification**: Personal online data is collected, analyzed, and sold for profit, turning users into the "product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:23">[02:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>.

### Ethical Considerations
The discussion highlights the importance of [[Applications and Ethics of AI | ethical]] principles in governing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:49">[02:53:49]</a>. Any technology can be used for good or bad, depending on how society chooses to utilize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. There is a growing concern that society might lose control over its choices, becoming enslaved by algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:05">[02:27:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:54">[02:31:54]</a>. This raises questions about whether humanity will accept a homogeneous society where behaviors are dictated by programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:58">[02:30:58]</a>.

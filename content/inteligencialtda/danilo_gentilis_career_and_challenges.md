[[danilo_gentilis_transition_to_talk_show_host | Danilo Gentili]] is highlighted as one of Brazil's "most persecuted cases" in the entertainment industry, stemming from his background as a comedian and his involvement with the first stand-up groups in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His journey has been defined by his unique approach to humor and the significant challenges he faced throughout his career.

## Early Career and the "Inexperienced Reporter"
Gentili's television career began with CQC (Custe o Que Custar), where he initially felt uncomfortable and created a "gag" around his inexperience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:14">[04:12:14]</a>. He was the only cast member on a temporary, three-month contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:09">[03:07:09]</a>. His segments as the "inexperienced reporter" gained popularity, leading the network to consider having two such reporters on the same program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Gentili himself, however, advised against it, fearing it would "ruin it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

During this period, he encountered political figures, notably being expelled from the São Paulo City Council and later the Brazilian Congress for asking tough questions about corruption, like the "cash register" scandal in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. He observed how certain political parties, like the Workers' Party (PT), were perceived as "spoiled by the press," making it difficult for anyone to challenge them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

## Venturing into Filmmaking
Gentili also explored filmmaking, acting as a guest in the movie "Mato sem Cachorro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. He contributed jokes to the script and was credited for his collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. He later worked on an animated film, contributing jokes to "every worm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:03]</a>.

His book, "How to Become the Worst Student in School," was adapted into a film after a director, Fabrício, approached him with the idea of a "Karate Kid of Bullying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Gentili agreed to the adaptation without selling the rights, provided he could work on the script and learn about filmmaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. The film won an award at Risadaria for "best film," a trophy which Gentili gave to Fabrício, acknowledging his vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Gentili reflected that if it had been solely his film, he would have "risked more and much more joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

His second film, "Os Exterminadores do Além Contra a Loira do Banheiro" (The Exterminators of the Beyond Against the Bathroom Blonde), was conceived as a horror-comedy to appeal to international horror festivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. He planned to incorporate Brazilian urban legends and work with friends to create a strong chemistry among the characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. This film, initially titled "Mary Bloody Mary" internationally, gained global distribution and won awards in Mexico, Canada, New Zealand, England, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.

## [[standup_comedy_experiences_and_challenges_in_Brazil | Stand-up Comedy Experiences and Challenges in Brazil]]
Gentili's introduction to stand-up comedy came through watching Jerry Lewis, who performed elegantly on stage in a suit and tie, telling stories that made people laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>. He later discovered the genre online around 2009, when he began his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:00">[28:48:00]</a>. Access to information was limited at the time, as the internet was expensive and not widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>. He would wait until after midnight to use the internet when phone charges were cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>.

He joined an Orkut community for stand-up comedy, connecting with early pioneers like Henrique Pantarotto, Marcela Leal, and Diogo Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:43:00">[34:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>. He performed at early venues like Beverly Hills, which was where many of the first stand-up comedians started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>. His first performance was a full set with three jokes, which he believes went "very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>.

Gentili describes himself as competitive only with himself, constantly striving to improve his material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>. He prefers writing his jokes directly rather than forcing physical humor on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:00">[40:55:00]</a>.

## Transition to Talk Show Host
Gentili's ambition was to create his own talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. He developed the project for "Agora é Tarde" (Now It's Late), even drawing the scenery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>, and envisioned Murilo and Leo as key cast members from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

Initially, he conditioned his contract renewal with CQC on being allowed to produce a pilot for his talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>. His pilot, which aired during the 2010 World Cup, achieved an unexpected 4.0 audience rating, a significant jump from the usual 0.3 in that time slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. This success led Band to greenlight more episodes, eventually making it a daily program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>.

Despite the show's success, Gentili faced [[challenges_and_experiences_in_the_comedy_industry | challenges and experiences in the comedy industry]] with the network, including a "super lean team" and difficult working conditions, such as lack of toilet paper and water for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:14">[01:36:14]</a>. He eventually decided to move to SBT, but only if he could bring his entire team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:17">[01:35:17]</a>. His loyalty to his team was paramount, even when Band offered him a substantial sum (500,000 reais) to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. He recalls this period as a "war" due to daily stress and fighting for basic resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>.

## Controversies and Public Perception
[[Danilo Gentilis transition to talk show host | Danilo Gentili]] has been embroiled in numerous controversies, often stemming from his political humor. He notes that the criticism escalated after his 2010 show in Brasília, where he made "very heavy jokes" about political figures like Lula and Dilma, as well as others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:49">[01:46:49]</a>. He believes this led to him being "blacklisted" and targeted by the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:10">[01:47:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>.

A notable incident involved a joke about a milk donor who wanted to enter the Guinness Book of Records. Gentili's joke referenced a male porn actor, Kid Bengala, taking her place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:55">[02:12:55]</a>. The joke was misconstrued by the press, particularly by a PT press office, which published headlines claiming he called her a "cow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>. This led to public outcry, false accusations of sexism, and even legal action against him, which he lost despite presenting evidence that he never used the word "cow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:52">[02:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:44">[02:20:44]</a>.

He attributes much of the backlash to political militancy and a "narrative" created to portray him as a "white male oppressor" targeting a "poor Northeastern woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>. He highlights a double standard, where attacks on left-wing figures are deemed "sexist" or "disrespectful," while similar jokes about other politicians are ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:38">[02:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:55">[02:08:55]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Resilience
Despite facing significant personal tragedies, including the sudden deaths of his father and sister, and losing possessions due to a blackout, Gentili states he "never doubted" his faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He finds strength in his belief in God, focusing on gratitude even during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:02">[02:32:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:42">[02:32:42]</a>.

He maintains a philosophy of not engaging in "war" or "fighting" against those who try to harm him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:40">[02:33:40]</a>. Instead, he focuses on removing disloyal individuals from his life for practicality, rather than seeking revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:20">[02:34:20]</a>. This approach has allowed him to remain fearless about losing his job or program, as he believes he has "everything he needs" as long as he has his faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:07">[02:34:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:11">[02:34:11]</a>.

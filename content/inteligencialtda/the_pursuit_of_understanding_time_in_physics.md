The concept of time has intrigued humanity since ancient philosophers pondered its nature, observing cycles in the natural world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. While for humans, time emerged as a definition based on the counting of cycles vital to everyday life, such as day, night, and years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, its true physical nature remains largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

## Time as a Human Concept
Early humans began to measure time by observing natural phenomena. The moon, with its distinct phases, was easier to track than the sun, which appears constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. A bone with carvings indicating lunar phases, dating back 30,000 years, is considered the first known human attempt at time measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. Stars and constellations were also crucial for marking seasons, aiding agricultural practices like planting and harvesting, particularly for ancient Egyptians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.

Modern timekeeping relies on highly precise definitions. A single second is currently measured based on the decay time of a Cesium-133 atom, specifically 9 billion vibrations of its isotope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. There's also a move towards defining it by the distance light travels in a given period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Calendars, like the Gregorian calendar we use, are human conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>, though they have undergone many "renovations" and can be messy (e.g., the varying lengths of July and August due to Roman emperors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. In contrast, the Chinese calendar, based on the moon's cycles, is considered a very good calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

## Time in Physics: A Four-Dimensional Universe
The idea of a four-dimensional universe, where time is an additional dimension alongside height, width, and depth, was proposed by Hermann Minkowski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This concept shifts our understanding from just "space" to "space-time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. In this framework, we are constantly "travelling" through time at a rate of one second per second, always moving towards the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Entropy and the Arrow of Time
From a physical perspective, the "arrow of time" is defined by entropy, specifically the Second Law of Thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. This law states that entropy, or the disorganization of the universe, always increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. For example, a broken glass cannot spontaneously reassemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>, nor can an omelette revert to an unbroken egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:42">[02:44:42]</a>. These are irreversible processes that give time its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:01">[02:49:01]</a>. While entropy can decrease locally (e.g., a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly, which appears more ordered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>, this is not true for the universe as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>.

### [[theories_of_relativity_and_time_dilation | Theories of relativity and time dilation]]
Albert Einstein's [[theories_of_relativity_and_time_dilation | theories of relativity and time dilation]] (special and general relativity) profoundly changed our understanding of time. They posit that time is not homogeneous, meaning it doesn't pass at the same rate everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

*   **Special Relativity**: This theory states that time passes differently for objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>. This phenomenon, known as time dilation, is observable in particle accelerators like the LHC, where accelerated particles decay slower than those at rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.
*   **General Relativity**: This expands on special relativity by incorporating gravity. It states that stronger gravity slows down time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>. This is why GPS satellites, which experience slightly weaker gravity and move at high speeds, require precise relativistic corrections to function accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. Without these corrections, GPS would be wildly inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. The theory of general relativity is currently the most consolidated theory of gravitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:09">[02:59:09]</a>.

### [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_time | Black holes and their impact on time]] and [[interstellar_travel_and_reference_frames | Interstellar Travel and Reference Frames]]
[[black_holes_and_theoretical_physics | Black holes]] are extreme examples of gravity's effect on time. Near a [[black_holes_and_theoretical_physics | black hole]], time passes much slower for an observer close to it compared to a distant observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. The movie *Interstellar* accurately portrays this concept on "Miller's Planet," which orbits a supermassive black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>. Two hours spent on Miller's Planet equated to 27 years on the mother ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:11">[01:32:11]</a>. This demonstrates how gravity enables [[theories_of_relativity_and_time_dilation | time travel]] to the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>.

The concept of a "reference frame" is crucial in understanding relativity. An object's speed or state of rest is always relative to a chosen reference point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. We don't feel the Earth's speed because we are in its reference frame; we only feel acceleration or changes in speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. This means if a ship travels at 90% the speed of light to Alpha Centauri (4.2 light-years away) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>, only two months might pass for those on board, while 4.2 years pass for those on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. This principle is key to discussing [[interstellar_travel_and_reference_frames | interstellar travel and reference frames]].

### Time Travel: Possibilities and Paradoxes
*   **Travel to the Future**: As demonstrated by [[theories_of_relativity_and_time_dilation | time dilation]] due to high speed or strong gravity, travel to the future is theoretically and experimentally possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:44">[01:32:44]</a>.
*   **Travel to the Past**: The Second Law of Thermodynamics, which dictates the irreversible increase of entropy, makes travel to the past impossible in our current understanding of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a>.
    *   **Paradoxes**: Concepts like the "Bootstrap Paradox" (e.g., a time machine's blueprint being delivered to the past, creating no original source) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:30">[01:46:30]</a> and the "Grandfather Paradox" (killing one's grandfather in the past, thus preventing one's own birth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:23">[01:47:23]</a> illustrate the impossibility of altering the past. The "principle of self-consistency" suggests that any trip to the past would only serve to ensure events happen exactly as they already did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:12">[01:50:12]</a>, as seen in *Interstellar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:25">[01:50:25]</a> and some interpretations of *Harry Potter* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>.
*   **Block Universe Theory**: A philosophical theory, popularized by the movie *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, suggests that the past, present, and future all exist simultaneously in a fixed "block" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. While there might be "small disruptions" creating different futures, the general future is already set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.
*   **Gedel's Universe**: Another theoretical solution derived from general relativity, Gedel's Universe, proposes a rotating universe where time is cyclical, allowing for a return to the same place and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.

### Wormholes and Higher Dimensions
Wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges, are theoretical tunnels through space-time that could connect two distant points, potentially enabling faster-than-light [[interstellar_travel_and_reference_frames | interstellar travel and reference frames]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:20">[02:09:20]</a>. Their existence, however, would require exotic matter (negative mass) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a> and have never been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:46">[02:09:46]</a>. While they might shorten spatial paths, they would not allow travel to a time before departure to avoid violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:55">[02:13:55]</a>.

The concept of higher dimensions is explored in *Interstellar*, where Cooper enters a "tesseract," a five-dimensional entity that allows him to access any time interval in his daughter's room through gravitational influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:53">[01:42:53]</a>. This is based on the idea that gravity is the only fundamental force that might extrapolate beyond our observed four dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>. Our limited perception, like a two-dimensional being unable to comprehend a sphere, means we may not perceive additional dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>.

### Quantum Physics and Time
Quantum physics presents a different perspective on time. It is considered a non-causal theory, meaning it doesn't strictly adhere to the laws of restricted relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>. Phenomena like quantum entanglement, where two distant particles instantly influence each other regardless of distance, seem to defy the speed limit of light for information transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. This concept, initially criticized by Einstein, was validated by the Nobel Prize in 2022 for its experimental demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.

## Unanswered Questions and Future Directions
Despite significant progress, the fundamental nature of gravity remains elusive. Scientists dream of finding the "graviton," a hypothetical particle that would quantify gravity, similar to how photons are the particles of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:51">[02:37:51]</a>. This would be a crucial step towards a unified theory of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:24">[02:38:24]</a>.

[[cosmological_theories_and_the_concept_of_cosmic_void | Cosmological theories and the concept of cosmic void]] also touch on time. The universe is considered homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, meaning it looks the same in every direction and from every point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:14">[02:30:14]</a>. The question of what existed "before" the [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | Big Bang Theory and Cosmology]] is nonsensical within the space-time framework, as time itself originated with the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>.

Humanity's ability to manipulate gravity or traverse time at will remains in the realm of theory. Our current technological capabilities are more geared towards self-destruction (e.g., atomic bombs, climate effects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:53">[02:41:53]</a> rather than [[interstellar_travel_and_reference_frames | intergalactic civilization]]. However, if we can overcome self-destruction and continue technological development, including propulsion systems capable of reaching fractions of the speed of light, an intergalactic future may be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:16">[02:42:16]</a>.

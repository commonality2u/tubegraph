Frank, a former member of the PCC (First Capital Command), has been living outside Brazil for approximately nine months following his exclusion from the faction and a decree on his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. He fled Brazil after making an initial video, driven by despair and the belief that he would die soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

He began his escape by fleeing Baixada Santista and hiding near Campinas, São Paulo, before eventually taking an Uber to Minas Gerais and then heading south towards Uruguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

## Life as a Fugitive
Frank's current lifestyle involves constant movement, as he does not stay more than a month in a single house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. He is currently traveling through various South American countries, including Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. His survival relies on a combination of divine intervention and strict [[Preparedness and survivalist strategies | survivalist strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

Key aspects of his adaptation include:
*   **Technological Safeguards** He uses IP camouflage and VPNs on his phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **Constant Relocation** He constantly changes his place of residence and travels from country to country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
*   **Threats and Isolation** He receives daily threats, including videos of people being tortured, with messages indicating he will be next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This constant pressure makes it challenging to maintain consistency with his YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. He has no family connection or support, as his mother previously filed a threat report against him when he joined the PCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>.

## Financial Challenges
Frank's financial situation abroad is precarious. His YouTube accounts, which receive money, and accounts for donations (Pix) have been blocked due to issues with income tax and fraudulent chargebacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>. He now faces uncertainty about how to obtain funds and must resolve these tax issues to unblock his money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>.

The cost of living in some South American countries is significantly higher than in Brazil. For example, a plate of food in Uruguay can cost R$100 (approximately 20 USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>. Chile is also very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. Argentina, while potentially more affordable, presents challenges due to the perceived opportunism of some locals, leading to petty theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>.

## Geographic Limitations
Despite traveling widely, Frank has limitations on where he can go due to the risk of being identified and killed. He cannot travel to countries like Colombia, Bolivia, or Venezuela because his face and tattoos make him easily recognizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:52">[02:57:52]</a>.

The PCC maintains activities in countries like Argentina, and operates on the border with Uruguay, near Jaguarão <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:31">[02:57:31]</a>. This means he must avoid areas where the faction has a strong presence or influence.

## Lack of Official Support
Frank highlights the complete absence of support from the Brazilian government or state authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. He was unable to obtain a passport because he had never voted, despite paying the necessary fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>. He also notes that he has received no support from politicians or police, despite reporting criminals with evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

He contrasts his situation with that of former criminals in the United States, who receive police protection, new identities, and housing when they cooperate against criminal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>. He views Brazilian justice as ineffective, citing his own experience of being released on R$25 bail after being arrested for armed robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

Frank believes his survival is a testament to God's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. He continues his mission of exposing organized crime, despite the immense personal risk and lack of institutional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>.

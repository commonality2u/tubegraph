This article explores the journey of a pastor, detailing his personal transformation, early experiences with various spiritual practices, and the challenges and insights gained through evangelization and engagement with different religious communities.

## Early Life and Spiritual Search

The pastor recounts growing up in São Sebastião do Paraíso, Minas Gerais, a countryside town, and initially feeling inferior when compared to those from larger churches [00:05:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">00:05:17</a>). Despite this, he now sees it as part of God's plan [00:06:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">00:06:06</a>). His consistent aim has been to help individuals, believing that saving one person can impact an entire world [00:06:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">00:06:13</a>).

His family had a mixed religious background, being Catholic but also frequenting a Spiritist Center [00:07:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">00:07:41</a>). This environment meant he grew up with a belief in the spiritual realm, noting that the Bible also discusses such topics [00:08:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">00:08:26</a>).

### First Encounters with God and Inner Emptiness
At around 10-12 years old, while on a mountain looking at the landscape, he had a profound [[personal_and_supernatural_experiences_related_to_faith | experience with God]], feeling a great peace and an internal conviction that a God must exist [00:08:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">00:08:52</a>). This was followed by another similar encounter in Rio de Janeiro, where he again felt immense peace [00:09:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">00:09:32</a>). Though he initially did not know how to find God, he later began reading the Bible for the first time at age 18 [00:10:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">00:10:14</a>).

His adolescence was marked by seeking worldly experiences, including alcohol and drugs, due to an "emptiness inside" that these things could not fill [00:10:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">00:10:28</a>). He also developed an interest in rock music and esotericism [00:11:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">00:11:23</a>).

## Radical Transformation and Calling

### Encountering the Occult and Divine Intervention
His musical aspirations led him to form a punk-rock band [00:12:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">00:12:01</a>). At 16, while dating a girl whose family practiced Candomblé, he visited a center where he witnessed a spiritual entity manifest [00:13:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">00:13:50</a>). The entity provided seemingly good advice and a name, which he kept secret [00:19:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">00:19:19</a>). This [[personal_and_supernatural_experiences_related_to_faith | supernatural experience]] was terrifying but also intriguing [00:16:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">00:16:17</a>).

Following this, he experienced intense inner turmoil, with constant thoughts of death and a feeling of impending doom [00:20:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">00:20:28</a>). When he considered calling upon the entity for help, an inner voice, which he now recognizes as the Holy Spirit, told him "that is not from God" [00:22:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">00:22:01</a>).

### [[Spiritual conversions and personal anecdotes | Conversion]] and a Divine Voice
His grandmother, a fervent Catholic who had a significant improvement in health after prayers from the Church of Grace, became a key figure [00:22:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">00:22:28</a>). Despite his room being filled with esoteric items, she prayed for him [00:22:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">00:22:48</a>). Shortly after, his girlfriend, who had also consulted the entity, ended their relationship, claiming to see her deceased mother and experiencing severe headaches [00:24:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">00:24:23</a>).

Leaving her house, he remembered his childhood prayer asking God for a girlfriend and, instead, prayed the Lord's Prayer [00:26:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">00:26:39</a>). It was then that he heard the voice of God for the first time, saying, "my son, you are very valuable for me and you will still see the great work that I will do in your life" [00:27:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">00:27:01</a>). This experience brought him profound peace and tears, something uncharacteristic for him [00:27:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">00:27:17</a>).

His friends at school initially mocked his [[coming_out_experience_and_personal_revelations | revelation]], calling it "nonsense" [00:28:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">00:28:00</a>). This led to a period of doubt and spiritual battle, as the "enemy tried to take that experience of my mind all the time" [00:28:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">00:28:20</a>).

### Cousin's Influence and Deepening Faith
A radical shift occurred when he visited a cousin who had converted to evangelical Christianity, was reading the Bible, and listening to Christian music [00:32:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">00:32:01</a>). His cousin explained the gospel, emphasizing Jesus' death on the cross for sins, which deeply impacted him [00:33:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">00:33:18</a>).

He initially tried to live a Christian life by avoiding sin on his own, but realized he couldn't without the Holy Spirit [00:34:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">00:34:34</a>). This conviction led him to seek out a church.

## Church Engagement and Spiritual Gifts

### First Church Experiences
His initial visit to an evangelical church on a Wednesday prayer night was intimidating due to the loud prayers [00:38:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">00:38:32</a>). He and his cousin left without entering, but a persistent curiosity drove them to return on Sunday [00:38:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">00:38:43</a>). At the church, a woman recognized him from his father's store and welcomed him, having prayed for him because of his "painted nails" and "torn clothes" [00:42:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">00:42:06</a>). He liked the church's atmosphere and messages but kept his attendance secret due to the "rocker" image he maintained [00:42:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">00:42:48</a>).

During a prayer vigil, he experienced a "revival" and witnessed someone speaking in tongues and laughing uncontrollably [00:44:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">00:44:19</a>). Despite his initial shyness, he felt a spontaneous urge to declare that God would speak to him, and subsequently experienced intense physical shaking and peace [00:45:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">00:45:34</a>).

### Visions, Dreams, and Prophetic Confirmations
During a vigil, he saw what he describes as a "wizard guy in the middle of the woods," which a friend later identified as a devil he needed to cast out [00:49:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">00:49:23</a>). This was his first direct encounter with the supernatural after conversion and confirmed the reality of spiritual warfare [00:49:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">00:49:15</a>).

His calling to be a pastor was affirmed through repeated [[personal_and_supernatural_experiences_related_to_faith | prophetic words]] and dreams of him preaching [00:52:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">00:52:43</a>). Despite his shyness, prophecies from within his church and from external ministries, like Toque no Altar, confirmed that God would use him mightily [00:53:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">00:53:03</a>). He also experienced a vision of being in a dark, peaceful place, which he later understood as an "anteroom" before heaven [00:55:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">00:55:14</a>).

### The Gift of Tongues and Holy Spirit Empowerment
His desire to pray in tongues led him to seek this gift through prayer and a three-day fast [00:58:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">00:58:08</a>). During a prayer session, the Holy Spirit "filled" him, and he began praying in tongues, an "incredible experience" [01:00:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">01:00:38</a>). He describes it as speaking directly to God, bypassing the rational mind, and leading to edification [01:19:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">01:19:05</a>).

He asserts that this gift, along with others like prophecy, has continued since the time of the apostles, refuting the cessationist view [01:15:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">01:15:59</a>). He notes that while everyone has access to the gift of tongues, not everyone will pray in them, and it does not make one "more saint" [01:22:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">01:22:04</a>).

## Evangelization and Church Influence

### Social Media and Evangelism
The pastor began using social media for evangelization in 2013 [00:03:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">00:03:41</a>). Initially, he was discouraged by low viewership [00:04:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">00:04:11</a>), but after a two-year break, he returned in 2015 and saw significant growth [00:04:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">00:04:35</a>). He believes social media is a powerful instrument for evangelization, allowing the message to reach places it never would otherwise [00:03:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">00:03:53</a>).

### Understanding Law and Grace in Ministry
His journey led him to a deeper understanding of "law" versus "grace." He explains that the law reveals sin, showing humanity's inability to save itself [02:04:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:27">02:04:27</a>). Grace, however, came through Jesus, offering complete forgiveness and enabling believers to live a holy life not by their own strength, but by the power of the Holy Spirit [02:03:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:39">02:03:39</a>). He emphasizes that salvation is not earned by works but received by faith [02:15:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:19">02:15:19</a>).

He criticizes religious leaders who focus on rules and campaigns, implying that blessings are conditional on adherence to practices like tithing [02:22:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:17">02:22:17</a>). He argues this creates a false sense of condemnation and discourages believers [02:22:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">02:22:46</a>). Instead, he advocates for living by grace, which empowers believers to overcome sin and experience God's goodness [02:17:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:49">02:17:49</a>).

### [[Challenges and interactions within and between different religious communities | Challenges and Perspectives]]
The pastor acknowledges that not all church members truly seek God, and some leaders are unprepared, leading to scandals and immature believers [02:26:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">02:26:24</a>). He stresses that a calling to ministry is essential, as the burden of spiritual leadership is immense and can lead to depression if not genuinely led by God [02:27:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:12">02:27:12</a>).

He emphasizes that [[spiritual_conversions_and_personal_anecdotes | spiritual transformation]] is a commitment, a public declaration to the spiritual world that one belongs to Jesus [03:15:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:55">03:15:55</a>). The devil, being organized, fights to prevent such conversions and to reclaim those who have left his influence [03:16:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">03:16:04</a>).

### Spiritual Warfare and Discernment
His experiences include witnessing demonic manifestations in church settings and participating in exorcisms [03:03:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:34">03:03:34</a>). He explains that demons are organized and can oppress individuals by accessing their soul and mind, especially through "openings" like unforgiveness or unconfessed sins [01:53:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:15">01:53:15</a>). He also confirms that while the name of Jesus is all-sufficient, certain stubborn cases may require specific practices like prayer and fasting [03:07:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:56">03:07:56</a>).

He cautions against engaging with occult practices or symbols, as they "facilitate the access of demons" [02:42:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:26">02:42:26</a>). He also differentiates between God's discipline, which is for correction, and divine punishment, which Jesus has already paid for [02:25:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:47">02:25:47</a>).

### Contemporary Issues
He discusses the [[influence_of_spirituality_and_religion | influence of secular music and art]], stating that while not inherently bad, believers must discern if such content hinders their relationship with God [02:35:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:01">02:35:01</a>). He believes God can use "anything" to convert people, even seemingly unlikely means like a cat's resurrection or a Madonna music video [03:09:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:51">03:09:51</a>).

He also addresses the "flat earth theory," stating that while he explored it, he believes planets exist [03:01:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:33">03:01:33</a>). He views the concept of a future Antichrist as a charismatic, deceptive figure who will imitate Christ, operating through a "satanic trinity" [02:52:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:02">02:52:02</a>). He stresses that while signs of the end times are increasing (wars, earthquakes, diseases), they are "contractions" that do not compare to the "Great Tribulation" [02:36:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">02:36:00</a>).

The pastor concludes by reiterating that God's plan is good, perfect, and pleasant, and that individuals have the freedom to choose to follow His path [01:50:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:18">01:50:18</a>).

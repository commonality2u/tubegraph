Palestinian resistance encompasses a wide range of strategies, from political and social movements to armed confrontation. The emergence of Hamas in 1987 marked a significant shift in the landscape of Palestinian resistance, operating alongside other organizations like the PLO's Fatah movement. The context of their strategies is rooted in a history of conflict, occupation, and the denial of self-determination.

## Historical Context of Resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:09">[05:20:09]</a>

The conflict is not merely 11 days old, but rather spans 75 years of a historical stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:09">[05:54:09]</a>. It is argued not to be a religious conflict, but rather a process beginning with British imperialism's "divide and conquer" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:09">[06:16:09]</a>. Historically, Palestine had coexisting Muslim, Christian, and Jewish populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:09">[07:07:09]</a>. However, a process of "unfair migration" began with international subsidies supporting Zionist migration after the first Zionist Congress in 1897 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:09">[07:27:09]</a>.

### Evolution of Zionist Ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:09">[21:42:09]</a>

Thiago √Åvila argues that while the initial idea of a home for the Jewish people in a "land without people for a people without land" seemed legitimate, from 1897 onwards, Zionism acquired a colonial character, anchoring itself in racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:09">[21:59:09]</a>. He maintains that this ideology is now unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:09">[22:04:09]</a>. Andre refutes the claim of Zionism being racist, stating that it is a movement for the national self-determination of the Jewish people and exists in plural forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:09">[36:11:09]</a>. He adds that Zionism aimed only to create a national Jewish home in their ancestral land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:09">[36:58:09]</a>. He also states that the concept of the Jewish people as a nation predates the Jewish religion and the 1897 congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:09">[44:51:09]</a>.

### Zionist Militias and Early Conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:09">[09:55:09]</a>

During the Arab rebellion against the British Empire in 1936, Zionist militias, which had gained economic control, allied with the British Empire against the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:09">[10:06:09]</a>. After World War II, the horrors of the Holocaust increased pressure for a Jewish state, but also intensified tensions in Historical Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:09">[11:13:09]</a>. The "Jewish Uprising" saw Zionist militias launch attacks, including the King David Hotel bombing in 1946, which killed 92 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:09">[11:38:09]</a>. These actions, described as terrorism, led the British to hand the issue to the UN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:09">[11:52:09]</a>.

Andre states that the King David Hotel was a British army headquarters, not a civilian target, though civilians died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:09">[33:09:09]</a>.

The UN Partition Plan (Resolution 181) in 1947 proposed dividing historical Palestine into two states, with Israel receiving the larger portion, including most arable lands, water reserves, and the Mediterranean coast, leaving the Palestinian territory fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:09">[12:49:09]</a>. When the British Mandate ended, Israel declared its creation, but no Palestinian state was declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:09">[12:55:09]</a>.

This led to what Arabs call "al-Nakba" (the great tragedy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:09">[13:02:09]</a>, where 750,000 Palestinian families were expelled, 520 villages destroyed, and atrocities committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:09">[13:20:09]</a>.

### Palestinian Intifadas and Hamas's Emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:09">[15:56:09]</a>

After the 1967 Six-Day War, where Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Golan Heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:09">[15:07:09]</a>, a process of revolt began in the Palestinian population. The **First Intifada** (uprising), starting around 1987, was a dignified revolt guaranteed by international law which prohibits colonization, military occupation, and forced displacement of civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:09">[16:50:09]</a>. It was met with immense brutality by the Zionist State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:09">[17:05:09]</a>.

This period also saw a divergence in political orientation among Palestinian organizations. While there's a belief that the "East" is monolithic, there's immense political diversity, including secular and Marxist organizations like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:09">[17:51:09]</a>. Most Palestinians desire self-determination and recovery of territory, at least to the 1967 borders reiterated by the UN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:09">[18:10:09]</a>.

*   **Emergence of Hamas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:09">[18:45:09]</a>
    *   Hamas emerged from a relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:09">[18:52:09]</a>.
    *   It started with humanitarian territorial work (health, education) but also adopted a military confrontation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:09">[19:05:09]</a>.
    *   Thiago condemns actions causing civilian suffering, including those by Hamas on October 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:09">[19:22:09]</a>.
    *   Hamas began to dispute political hegemony with Fatah, the PLO leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:09">[19:55:09]</a>.
    *   In 2006, Hamas won elections in Palestine, becoming hegemonic in Gaza, while the Palestinian National Authority (created from the Oslo Accords) controls the West Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:09">[24:00:09]</a>.

### Oslo Accords and the Second Intifada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:09">[19:59:09]</a>

The Oslo Accords (1993) saw Israel commit to returning occupied territories, but with limitations denying Palestinian sovereignty, armed forces, and territorial integrity, and setting a 7-year withdrawal period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:09">[20:17:09]</a>. This generated frustration because the agreement did not guarantee self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:09">[20:22:09]</a>.

When Israel did not withdraw as agreed by 2000, and instead continued settlement expansion, the **Second Intifada** erupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:09">[20:57:09]</a>. This was further triggered by Israel's invasion of the Al-Aqsa Mosque with 1,000 soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:09">[21:05:09]</a>. The Second Intifada was a prolonged confrontation characterized by disproportionate force from Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:09">[21:26:09]</a>.

### Gaza Blockade and Current Situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:09">[25:07:09]</a>

After a military defeat in Lebanon in 2006, Israel imposed a total siege on Gaza, which has continued for 17 years, creating the "world's largest open-air prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:09">[25:13:09]</a>. This has resulted in 85% unemployment, 4 hours of electricity per day (before the current conflict), widespread nutritional problems, and 96% contaminated water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:09">[25:49:09]</a>.

*   **October 7th Event**: The events of October 7th are described as stemming from this "strangulation situation" leading to successive rebellions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:09">[26:24:09]</a>. While the date must be condemned for civilian suffering, it is understood as a response from a people fighting for liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:09">[26:59:09]</a>.

### Hamas as a Terrorist Organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>

Andre states that targeting civilians purposefully is terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:09">[32:32:09]</a>. He compares Hamas's actions on October 7th to those of ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and Jabhat al-Nusra, noting that these groups' main victims are often Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:09">[33:33:09]</a>. He highlights that Hamas's charter explicitly states its war against Jews and aims to obliterate Israel, proving it is a religious conflict for Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:46:09">[51:46:09]</a>.

Thiago, on the other hand, believes that if Hamas is to be classified as a terrorist organization, then all organizations that have had similar behaviors throughout history should be, including state terrorism committed by Israel and the United States, which have bombed hospitals and maintained military checkpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. He argues that the term "terrorist dictatorship" is a qualification of imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:44">[01:39:44]</a>.

### Resistance Tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:09">[26:27:09]</a>

Palestinian resistance tactics vary:
*   **Non-violent tactics**: Such as agitation, international boycotts, divestment, and sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:09">[26:33:09]</a>.
*   **Armed confrontation**: While condemned for civilian suffering, this is seen as a people fighting for liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:09">[26:43:09]</a>. International law allows people to resist military occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

### Calls for a Solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:09">[03:46:09]</a>

*   **Two-state solution**: Andre believes that a solution today requires each side to accept some level of injustice for themselves (Israelis and Palestinians) for justice to be applied to both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:09">[37:45:09]</a>. He states that the idea of a binational state is not desired by either side and is politically and militarily impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:09">[41:17:09]</a>. He supports a two-state solution where Israel exists as the national state of the Jewish people and Palestine exists as the national state of the Palestinian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:31">[01:46:31]</a>.
*   **Plurinational state**: Thiago suggests a plurinational state, similar to historical Palestine where all peoples coexisted peacefully, or like the South African model post-apartheid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:19">[01:47:19]</a>. This would require decolonization, ending genocide, ending military occupation, and deconstructing racist ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:26">[01:47:26]</a>. He believes this is a "worthy solution" and that a plurinational state would be a "better way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>.
*   **Role of the UN**: It is suggested that a deep UN peace mission is necessary to stop the current [[israel_and_hamas_conflict | genocide]] in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:22">[03:02:22]</a>. In 1956, a UN peacekeeping mission was the only force that stopped Israel and recovered the Sinai region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:42">[03:02:42]</a>. The UN is called to take a stand to prevent a catastrophic war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:19">[03:03:19]</a>.

### Ideological Warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>

Both speakers acknowledge the role of media and ideological construction in shaping narratives. Thiago highlights Antonio Gramsci's concept of coercion and consent in maintaining hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, where dehumanization of the "other" creates moral justification for military actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. He calls out "war propaganda," comparing current media narratives to the false claims of WMDs in Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. He states that Israel specializes in "war propaganda" due to the effectiveness of the "Zionist Lobby" in presenting Israel as a "helpless state" to the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>.

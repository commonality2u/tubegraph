[[neuroscience_and_brain_function | The brain]] and body are interconnected, and conditions affecting one can profoundly impact the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>. Insulin resistance, a metabolic issue, has notable implications for [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | brain function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>.

## What is Insulin Resistance?
Insulin is a hormone that allows cells in the muscles, liver, and fat to capture glucose from the blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. When there's an increase in blood glucose, insulin levels also rise, enabling cells to absorb this glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.

[[psychiatric_nutrition_and_mental_health | Insulin resistance]] occurs when cells become "resistant" to insulin's action, failing to identify its presence effectively. This means glucose cannot be captured, leading to high blood sugar levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. This condition is primarily observed in [[psychiatric_nutrition_and_mental_health | Type 2 Diabetes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. Excessive sugar consumption can contribute to insulin resistance, as the pancreas releases so much insulin that cells eventually become unresponsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Insulin's Role in the Brain

While [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | neurons]] in the brain do not depend on insulin to capture glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>, insulin itself is present in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>. For a long time, the purpose of insulin in the brain was unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

It has since been discovered that insulin in the [[human_brain_capabilities_and_limitations | brain]] plays a crucial role in:
*   Memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>
*   Focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>
*   Attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>
*   General [[intelligence_and_cognitive_processes | cognitive improvement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>

Improving peripheral insulin metabolism also leads to improved central (brain) insulin use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. This highlights the inseparable connection between the mind, [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | brain]], and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>.

## Impact of Diet on Brain Insulin Function
Studies have investigated the [[the_role_of_physical_activity_and_diet_in_brain_health | relationship between high-calorie, high-fat, and high-fructose diets]] and their impact on the [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | brain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Specifically, high-fructose corn syrup, commonly used to sweeten soft drinks, is linked to negative effects on the [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | central nervous system]] and [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | brain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

Consuming such diets can lead to increased glucose and lipids (LDL fat, triglycerides) in the body, and critically, to insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. This peripheral insulin resistance can negatively impact the brain's ability to utilize insulin effectively for cognitive functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.

## Insulin Resistance and Alzheimer's Disease

[[neuroscience_and_brain_function | Type 2 Diabetes]] patients who have acquired [[psychiatric_nutrition_and_mental_health | insulin resistance]] due to diet and lifestyle habits are twice as likely to develop [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | Alzheimer's disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a>. This suggests that issues with [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | brain]] insulin function contribute to the development of [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | Alzheimer's]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>.

## Conclusion
The intricate relationship between peripheral insulin resistance and [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | brain function]] underscores the importance of [[the_role_of_physical_activity_and_diet_in_brain_health | maintaining healthy lifestyle habits]], including [[the_role_of_physical_activity_and_diet_in_brain_health | diet]] and [[relation_between_physical_exercise_and_cognitive_functions | physical activity]], for overall [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | brain health]] and [[human_brain_capabilities_and_limitations | cognitive function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

Pastor Antonio shares his [[spiritual_conversions_and_personal_anecdotes | personal transformation]] and deep [[spirituality_and_personal_beliefs | spiritual journey]], detailing his path from a mixed religious background to becoming a pastor, marked by profound [[exploration_of_personal_and_collective_spirituality | spiritual experiences]] and encounters with both divine and demonic forces.

## Early Life and Search for Meaning
Born in São Sebastião do Paraíso, Minas Gerais, Pastor Antonio grew up in the countryside [00:05:17]. Despite coming from a structured family with good education, he felt an emptiness inside [00:11:13]. His family was Catholic, but they also frequented a Spiritist Center, leading to a mixed religious environment [00:07:40]. Many people, he notes, believe in a [[spirituality_and_personal_beliefs | spiritual side]] while simultaneously being Catholic [00:07:56].

At around 10 to 12 years old, while on a mountain with his uncle and brother, he had a profound experience [00:08:46]. Observing nature, he felt an undeniable presence of God and a great peace, though he kept it to himself [00:09:07]. Later, during a sleepless night in Rio de Janeiro, he prayed to God, asking to know Him and once again felt that immense peace [00:09:32].

His adolescence was marked by seeking fulfillment in worldly things, including alcohol and drugs [00:10:28]. He notes that his parents were "crazy" as they didn't teach him such behaviors, yet he felt an inner void [00:11:07]. Around 15 years old, he became interested in rock music and esotericism, listening to diverse genres and engaging with esoteric practices like burning incense [00:12:00].

He formed a punk-rock band, dreaming of fame and success, but this path led to further personal challenges, including wearing multiple earrings, black nail polish, and ripped clothes, much to his parents' dismay [00:12:01].

## Encounter with the Occult
At 16, he began dating a girl whose family practiced Candomblé [00:14:35]. Though his own family was somewhat scared due to his previous "extreme" nature [00:14:52], he started attending the Candomblé center with her [00:15:03]. He describes the center as a large, dimly lit hall adorned with images of saints and caboclos [00:15:23]. During the rituals, people would "squirm" and change their demeanor, playing drums and using lipstick, in preparation for entities to materialize and give consultations [00:16:00].

He recounts a frightening experience where an entity, incorporated in a person, spoke to him and his girlfriend, giving seemingly good advice like taking off his earrings and complimenting their relationship [01:18:24]. However, he later understood this as a deceptive tactic of Satan, who disguises himself as an "angel of light" to destroy relationships [01:18:50]. This entity even gave him a name to call if he needed help [01:19:19], a name he kept for years [01:19:28].

The week following this experience was the "worst of [his] life," filled with thoughts of death and a deep sense of despair [02:02:32]. He even wrote a farewell letter to his family [02:04:49]. In his desperation, he almost called the entity, but a powerful internal voice, which he now believes was the Holy Spirit, told him not to [02:21:30].

## Crisis and Divine Intervention
His paternal grandmother, a fervent Catholic who had experienced healing through prayer, visited his room, filled with esoteric items [02:22:28]. She prayed for him, and though he initially dismissed it, he believes God was already at work [02:23:51].

Shortly after, his girlfriend, who had also consulted the entity, ended their relationship, citing a headache and feeling it wouldn't work [02:24:23]. As he left her house, alone on a dark street, he remembered his earlier prayer on the mountain where he had asked God for a girlfriend [02:26:39]. He began praying the Lord's Prayer, the only prayer he knew well, and heard the voice of God clearly for the first time [02:26:50]. God told him, "My son, you are very valuable to me, and you will still see the great work that I will do in your life" [02:27:03]. He cried profoundly, experiencing a peace he had never known [02:27:17]. This strong, unmistakable voice of God was a pivotal [[personal_transformation_and_faith | personal transformation]] moment [02:27:50].

## The Path to Evangelical Christianity
His newfound [[faith and spirituality discussions | faith]] was met with skepticism by friends, who mocked him for being the "messiest" and claimed God doesn't speak to people directly [02:28:00]. This skepticism caused him to doubt his experience, but he now understands it was the enemy trying to undermine his spiritual encounter [02:28:20].

At 18, with his band plans faltering, he visited his cousin, PH, who had radically converted to evangelical Christianity [03:09:59]. PH told him that Jesus had changed his life [03:10:20]. Initially resistant, he eventually engaged in deep [[faith and spirituality discussions | conversations]] with PH, who systematically explained biblical doctrines and the nature of sin and salvation [03:31:18]. He realized his efforts to live righteously without the Holy Spirit were futile [03:34:34].

After several visits and conversations, he decided to attend an evangelical church [03:55:08]. His first attempt with a cousin was aborted due to the loud prayers outside the church building [03:57:57]. He later attended a Wednesday prayer service with another cousin, despite the pastor advising them to come on Sunday [03:58:19]. Upon arriving, he was met by a welcoming sister who recognized him from his father's store and had prayed for him because of his "torn clothes" and painted nails [04:02:09].

## Receiving the Holy Spirit and Prophetic Words
During a prayer vigil, despite temptations to stay away, he decided to go [04:31:01]. He felt like a "fish out of water" amidst the fervent worship [04:44:04]. He witnessed people speaking in tongues and laughing uncontrollably, which was part of a powerful move of the Holy Spirit occurring throughout Brazil at that time [04:44:04].

Spontaneously, he declared that God would speak to him that night [04:57:52]. As he knelt, his body began to shake, feeling a tremor and intense heat [04:04:16]. He thought he was dying, relating it to his cousin's earlier warning [04:04:47]. A deacon then preached, describing his life with startling accuracy, including his suicidal thoughts and troubled state [04:05:08]. This led him to give his life to Jesus, experiencing profound peace and weeping like a child [04:05:08].

In subsequent vigil, a woman named Anna Claudia prayed for him, prophesying that God would use him mightily, reaching people across Brazil and beyond, despite his shyness and past as a rock band singer [05:53:09]. Another profound prophetic word came during a "Toque no Altar" concert in Ribeirão Preto, where a speaker singled him out from 3,000 people, confirming God's powerful work in his life [05:54:12].

## Supernatural Encounters
Upon leaving the vigil where he committed his life to Jesus, he had his first conscious contact with the supernatural. He saw a wizard-like figure in the woods, an image no one else could see [04:59:15]. He was told to "cast out in the name of Jesus" [04:59:40], which he did, causing the figure to disappear [05:00:00]. This, he later understood, was an act of the enemy trying to dissuade him [05:00:50].

A more positive [[spiritual_themes_and_religious_interpretations | supernatural encounter]] occurred when a godly woman in an apartment prayed for the group. She prophesied over him, stating, "My son, I took you out of darkness, and great will be the work that I will do in your life, and from today onwards, I call you shepherd" [05:40:07]. At that very moment, he saw an angel place a crown on his head [05:40:07]. God spoke to him through the crown, explaining that its many "little stones" represented the souls he would generate for God [05:40:07].

He also had a spiritual experience where he woke up in a completely dark place, feeling immense peace and the presence of God [05:51:14]. He later understood this to be an "anteroom" or portal before heaven, similar to an experience described by a late pastor [05:56:07].

## Gifts of the Spirit
Antonio shares his journey into understanding and experiencing the [[spiritual_themes_and_religious_interpretations | gifts of the Holy Spirit]], specifically tongues (glossolalia) and prophecy.

### Tongues (Glossolalia)
Initially, he desired to pray in tongues out of curiosity and a desire to be "very connected with God" [05:58:08]. After a three-day fast with a friend, where they prayed for God to reveal His calling, he received the gift of tongues [01:00:37]. He describes it as an "incredible experience" where his mouth seemed to speak uncontrollably, filled with the Holy Spirit's presence [01:00:44].

He notes that tongues are for personal edification, a direct communication with God where "you don't speak men, you don't speak...it's like you speak directly to God" [01:19:01]. He also addresses the debate within Christianity about whether the gift of tongues ceased after Pentecost, firmly stating that it continues, citing Pauline epistles and the Book of Acts [01:15:35]. He differentiates between praying in tongues and the "language of angels" mentioned by Paul [01:19:15].

### Prophecy and Discernment
Antonio explains that while praying in tongues, he sometimes receives "thoughts" or "discernment" about a person's situation, which he shares, inviting them to discard it if it doesn't resonate [01:20:29]. This demonstrates the gift of [[spiritual_themes_and_religious_interpretations | prophecy]], which is distinct from words of knowledge (relating to the past) and words of wisdom (relating to the future) [01:23:45]. Prophecy, he clarifies, is essentially "preaching the word of God" that God reveals [01:24:07]. He notes that often, when God speaks to someone through prophecy, it confirms something God has already been speaking to them individually [01:24:34].

## Spiritual Warfare Explained
Antonio believes that [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | spiritual warfare]] is a very real, constant battle [01:12:12].

### Demons and Possession
He explains that demons are organized, with hierarchies, and seek to destroy [01:09:09]. They are present on Earth, acting in "spiritual regions" [01:33:41]. He distinguishes between demonic possession (where a demon controls a person's spirit) and demonic oppression (where a demon pressures the soul and mind) [01:52:51]. A born-again Christian, whose spirit is controlled by the Holy Spirit, cannot be possessed but can be oppressed [01:52:51]. Oppression manifests as negative feelings like great discouragement or a lack of desire to do anything [01:53:41].

Demons gain access through "openings" or "gaps" that people create, such as holding grudges, unconfessed sins, or engaging in certain vices [01:54:16]. These openings allow the enemy to bring "vices" and "prisons of sins," leading to a person being dominated in their soul and emotions [01:54:55]. Resisting the devil by seeking God, confessing sins, and releasing forgiveness can close these gaps [01:54:06].

### Satan's Tactics
Satan, though not omnipotent, is cunning and knowledgeable about human nature [01:33:55]. He "blinds the understanding of people" to prevent them from receiving the Gospel [01:37:08]. He imitates God's work, performing false miracles and deceiving people [01:39:37]. He throws "inflamed darts" (thoughts) into people's minds, making them believe these thoughts are their own [01:34:13]. Satan also uses "familiar spirits," demons that accompany families and perpetuate cycles of sin and vice [02:56:06].

### Exorcism
Antonio recounts personal experiences with [[exorcism_and_spiritual_warfare | exorcism]]. He describes a time when a girl, heavily involved in the occult, manifested demonic activity during a church service [03:04:39]. When he placed his hand on her, he felt "fire" and she became violently agitated, throwing him [03:05:37]. The demon spoke through her with sarcasm, accusing him of his past sins, trying to discourage him [03:06:05].

He also details a particularly challenging exorcism of a friend's brother who was deeply involved in the "wrong world" [03:08:50]. This individual manifested with superhuman strength and curses, claiming to be a "legion" of demons [03:12:46]. Antonio, along with other pastors, had to persist for extended periods, as demons, due to their hierarchical nature, may not leave immediately, even when commanded in Jesus' name [03:06:40]. He emphasizes that this is a spiritual battle requiring "authority of the name of Jesus" [03:10:13].

## Law vs. Grace
Antonio delves into the theological distinction between the Law and Grace in Christianity, explaining how this understanding impacts a believer's [[personal_transformation_and_faith | spiritual journey]].

### The Purpose of Law
The Law, given through Moses, served to reveal sin and humanity's inability to overcome it on its own [02:00:54]. He explains that without the Law, people might not fully grasp the extent of their sinfulness [02:01:32]. The Law's purpose is not to make people live a perfectly correct life, but to demonstrate that humanity is "nothing without God" and utterly dependent on His grace and mercy [02:03:07]. Trying to be justified by the Law means being condemned, as failing in even one commandment leads to guilt [02:03:23].

### The Era of Grace
Grace, which came through Jesus Christ, ushers in a "New Covenant" [02:03:39]. While the Law exposed sin, Grace provides the strength to overcome it [02:15:52]. Salvation is not earned by works or adherence to rules, but is a gift received by faith in Jesus' sacrifice on the cross [02:15:19]. He stresses that Jesus' death was a complete and perfect sacrifice, offering permanent forgiveness for all sins [02:11:00]. This means believers are already saved and forgiven, and do not need to live in fear of punishment or constant self-condemnation [02:11:00].

### Freedom in Christ
A person born again by the Holy Spirit desires to please God and is no longer bound by the practice of sin [02:56:22]. Though they may still stumble and sin, it no longer separates them from God because Jesus has paid the price [02:57:03]. The challenge is to live by faith, trusting in God's forgiveness and not relying on human effort [02:57:47]. He critiques churches that still emphasize legalistic rules, leading to frustrated and unhappy believers [02:22:17].

## Free Will and Divine Plan
Antonio discusses the concept of free will in relation to God's plan for salvation and individual lives. He believes that while Adam and Eve had complete free will to choose between sin and obedience, humanity after the Fall is born with a nature that makes it difficult to choose righteousness without divine intervention [02:44:41].

He acknowledges that salvation is ultimately God's choice, stating, "if God had not chosen, I would not have chosen God" [02:45:31]. However, he also emphasizes that God desires "everyone to be saved" [02:46:39], and presents opportunities for people to respond to His call [02:45:58]. God will not force anyone, but He will guide those who seek Him, revealing the path they should follow [02:47:22].

He explains that God's plan for individuals is not rigidly fixed but is influenced by their heart and desires [02:46:40]. God knows the future, but individuals still make choices, and God's plan unfolds through those choices [02:47:07]. He shares how God revealed his wife to him, but he still had to make the choice to pursue her [02:47:37].

## Everyday Life and Spiritual Discipline
Antonio believes that Christians are meant to live *in* the world, not be taken *out* of it, to influence others [02:37:42]. He discusses the role of secular music and art, arguing that God created music and there's no blanket rule against secular art [02:38:00]. However, he emphasizes personal discernment: if something, like certain music, leads a person back to worldly desires or hinders their [[role_of_religion_and_spirituality_in_personal_growth | spiritual growth]], it should be avoided [02:39:11].

He also addresses rules regarding appearance (tattoos, hair dye, plastic surgery), stating that these are not what sanctify a person [02:39:47]. The key is whether these things become an "exaggerated vanity" that takes focus away from God [02:41:01].

Discipline is also a part of God's love [02:54:07]. God disciplines those He loves, not through punishment, but through consequences that lead to repentance and maturity [02:54:07]. He uses the example of someone suffering a sexually transmitted disease due to engaging in sin; it's not God punishing them, but the consequence of their actions [02:58:19].

## Final Thoughts on God's Nature
God is good, merciful, and a God of grace [02:50:07]. His goodness, not the fear of punishment, leads people to repentance [02:52:02]. He desires that His children be happy and live life in abundance [02:22:10]. The focus should be on trusting God's completed work through Jesus rather than trying to earn salvation or blessings through human effort or adherence to rules [02:13:50].

## Q&A Session
### Voice of God
Asked if God's voice resembles someone known, Antonio states that God can use anything to communicate [02:48:47]. He gives examples of Jesus appearing in a familiar form to a boy from a specific tribe [03:00:35], a former voodoo practitioner converting through his cat [03:10:50], and a man converting at a nightclub through a Madonna music video [03:10:50]. He emphasizes that anything that comes from God brings peace and draws a person closer to Him, while confusion is not from God [03:33:34].

### Aliens
Antonio expresses skepticism about the existence of aliens, believing that God created the Earth for humanity [03:00:51]. While he doesn't doubt strange apparitions, he believes they are likely demons [03:00:21]. He also briefly touches on conspiracy theories like the flat earth and Project Blue Beam (a supposed project to project images into the sky to deceive people) [03:13:31]. He believes such deceptions are the work of the enemy, who can use various means, including miracles, to mislead [03:13:10].

### Spiritual Travel and Ouija Boards
Antonio warns against engaging in practices like astral travel or using Ouija boards/cup games, describing them as "extremely dangerous" [03:19:35]. He states that there is nothing in the Bible instructing believers to access these spiritual realms [03:19:41]. He believes such activities open doors for demons, which are organized and seek to imprison people in sin [03:19:54]. While people may genuinely experience things through these means, he asserts that they are not from God [03:18:20].

### The Antichrist
The Antichrist is a human being, but influenced by the devil, in opposition to Christ [03:51:03]. He will be charismatic and will deceive nations [03:52:48]. He is part of a "Satanic Trinity" (Satan, Antichrist, False Prophet) that imitates the Holy Trinity [03:51:30].

### Contact with the Dead
He clarifies that, according to the Bible, there is no contact between the living and the dead [03:53:51]. He references the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, which illustrates an "abyss between life and death" [03:54:50]. Any apparent communication from the dead, he believes, is a deception orchestrated by "familiar spirits" (demons that imitate deceased family members to perpetuate sin in families) [03:55:56].

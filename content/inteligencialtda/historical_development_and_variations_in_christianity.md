[[Historical Context of the Early Christian Church | Christianity]] is a religion centered around the person and work of Jesus Christ, with a rich and diverse history marked by significant theological discussions and movements.

## Understanding Biblical Texts
Reading any text, including the Bible, requires loyalty to the text itself, understanding its literary genre [04:38:00]. The Bible presents itself in various genres; for example, Genesis 1-3 presents as a narrative that should be read as history [05:11:00], similar to Genesis Chapter 12 which critics acknowledge as narrative [05:59:00].

### Genesis, Science, and Human Dignity
The Genesis account asks to be believed as having actually happened [06:26:00]. Science cannot ascertain things narrated in Genesis, such as God or miracles, as they are beyond its experimental reach [07:00:00]. While science can help understand processes like microevolution (adaptation within a species), it cannot prove macroevolution (one species evolving into another) due to lack of fossil evidence and philosophical challenges [07:40:00]. [[Christianity and redemption | Christian]] theology sees denying the historicity of Genesis 1-3 as problematic because these chapters establish fundamental concepts like:
*   **Human Dignity:** Humans are created in the image and likeness of God, providing a basis for compassion and human rights, unlike the law of the strongest observed in nature [10:07:00]. This divine image makes humans unique [10:53:00].
*   **Origin of Sin:** Genesis Chapter 3 explains the origin of human flaws and the "original sin," leading to a disconnection from God, who is the "Source of All Good" [11:35:00]. This inherent flaw manifests as a longing for connection, which is universal and leads to the creation of religions [13:00:00].

### Paradise and the Fall
Paradise is initially described as a garden where God walked and related with Adam and Eve, who were created without sin but with the possibility of disobeying [15:58:00]. Their disobedience led to their expulsion from Paradise and the introduction of sin into the human race [16:12:00]. God, being omniscient, foresaw this fall but still granted free will, allowing for a story of [[Christianity and redemption | redemption]] built on free decisions of moral creatures like angels and humans [19:09:00].

## Core Tenets of Historical Christianity
[[Church History and Theological Discussions | Historical Christianity]] refers to the beliefs held consistently by Christians across all ages [47:00:00]. Its fundamental tenets include:
*   Belief in a triune God [47:11:00].
*   God's self-revelation through the Old and New Testaments [47:15:00].
*   Jesus Christ as the Son of God, who died for sins, resurrected on the third day, and will return [47:17:00]. This is largely encapsulated in the Apostles' Creed [47:27:00].

### The Person of Christ
The nature of Jesus Christ was a central point of debate in the [[Historical Context of the Early Christian Church | early Christian church]] for centuries [55:36:00]. The [[Church History and Theological Discussions | Nicene Creed]] ultimately articulated that Jesus is one person with two distinct, unmixed, unconfused, and inseparable natures: divine and human [57:18:00].
*   **Humanity:** Jesus was truly human, growing up, learning, feeling hunger and thirst, and experiencing limitations of the flesh [50:18:00]. He lived a perfectly normal life until beginning his public ministry around age 30 [51:11:00].
*   **Divinity:** As God, he possessed omniscience and could perform miracles [58:35:00]. His divine nature could act independently of his human nature's knowledge, yet both were inseparable [58:12:00]. For example, he could heal someone without his human self being consciously aware of the power leaving him, yet still ask "Who touched me?" [58:02:00]. He also knew future events, but as a man, did not know the exact time of his return [59:12:00].
*   **Death and Resurrection:** Jesus's death on the cross is central to [[Christianity and redemption | Christianity]] as he bore the weight of human sins, receiving the punishment due to humanity [32:08:00]. This atonement is unique among religions, as other founders offered teachings but did not die for their followers [33:37:00]. His death and resurrection are equally crucial; without resurrection, he would be just another man who died, and without his death, the sacrifice for sin would be incomplete [42:47:00]. The empty tomb and the testimonies of hundreds of witnesses, including Paul, who was a persecutor, confirm his resurrection [43:21:00].

### The Trinity
While the word "Trinity" is not explicitly in the Bible, the concept is supported by passages that affirm one God while also addressing the Father, Son (Jesus), and Holy Spirit as God [01:02:27]. This doctrine was elaborated later to define the concept of three persons in one God, despite initial controversies in [[Church History and Theological Discussions | early church history]] [01:04:33].

### The Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit has been active since the beginning of creation [01:05:02]. While present throughout biblical history, the Holy Spirit gained more prominence after the coming of Christ, marking a "dispensation of the Holy Spirit" where gifts are poured out upon all believers, not just select figures like kings or prophets [01:05:29].

## Historical Development and Variations
[[Church History and Theological Discussions | Church history]] has seen various interpretations and movements:

### Medieval Catholicism and the Reformation
During the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church developed two key concepts that sparked the [[Protestant Reformation historical and theological context | Reformation]]:
1.  **Interdependence of Christ and Church:** The church saw itself as a continuation of Christ's incarnation, granting it the authority to forgive sins (e.g., through the Pope, sacraments) [01:45:33].
2.  **Nature and Grace:** God's grace was believed to be transmitted through natural elements or objects (e.g., holy water, oil, host, relics, images) [01:46:40].

Many reformers before Luther, like Jan Hus and John Wycliffe, sought to reform the church due to issues like clergy ignorance and the lack of Bible access for common people [01:48:21]. Martin Luther's awakening came from reading Romans, where he realized that justification before God is by faith in Christ, not by works [01:49:10]. This contradicted the Catholic view of justification as a process aided by sacraments [01:50:29].

The Reformation emphasized "Sola Scriptura" (Scripture alone), asserting that the Bible is the sole source of authority for true [[Historical context and development of Protestant theology | Christianity]], rejecting tradition and magisterium as equal authorities [01:52:18]. The Catholic Church later responded by adding seven books to the Old Testament canon during the Council of Trent to differentiate their Bible from the Protestant one and to support certain doctrines like purgatory [01:53:15].

The **Protestant Reformation** also led to [[differences_among_protestant_reform_movements | differences among reform movements]]. While Luther and Calvin agreed on justification by faith and Sola Scriptura, they diverged on the interpretation of the Eucharist [01:55:16]. Luther adhered to "consubstantiation" (Christ's real presence in the elements), while Calvin believed in Christ's spiritual presence [01:55:46].

### Modern Christian Variations
*   **Theological Liberalism:** Emerging in the 18th century influenced by rationalism, this movement denies miracles and often reduces Christianity to social help, exemplified by Liberation Theology [01:48:25].
*   **Deism:** A form of [[Historical context and development of Protestant theology | Christianity]] that believes God created the world but does not intervene in its affairs [01:48:41].
*   **Pentecostal Movement:** Originating around 1906, this movement emphasizes spiritual revival, emotional experiences, and the restoration of spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues and prophecy [01:56:47].
*   **Neo-Pentecostalism (Third Wave):** A later development within Pentecostalism, characterized by emphasis on spiritual warfare and prosperity theology [02:44:27]. Prosperity theology, by abstracting biblical verses, suggests a transactional relationship with God, where material blessings are guaranteed in exchange for offerings [02:45:00]. This can distract from the central message of reconciliation with God and forgiveness of sins [02:47:33].

### Political Involvement
Christians, as citizens, have the right to political expression [02:39:57]. However, denominations should generally avoid official political endorsements to prevent implications when politicians make mistakes [02:40:10]. The church's prophetic function is to call rulers to account when they overstep their mandate, oppress, or are corrupt [02:43:17].

## Eschatology (The Study of Last Things)
[[Christian eschatology and prophecy | Christian eschatology]] is a highly controversial subject due to varying interpretations of biblical texts, particularly the Book of Revelation [02:08:58].

### Interpretations of the Millennium
The central issue in eschatology is the interpretation of the "thousand years" mentioned in Revelation 20:
*   **Premillennialism:** Interprets the thousand years literally, believing Christ will return *before* the millennium to reign on Earth for a literal thousand years [02:11:33]. Some premillennialists also believe in a secret rapture of the church before the Great Tribulation, though this idea is relatively recent (last 200-250 years) [02:12:34].
*   **Postmillennialism:** Interprets the millennium figuratively as a long period of peace and church dominance on Earth, after which Christ will return [02:13:06]. This view declined in popularity after the World Wars [02:13:46].
*   **Amillennialism:** Interprets the millennium figuratively as already happening, with Christ reigning from his resurrection on the throne of the universe and within his church [02:13:58]. This view does not believe in a secret rapture [02:14:42].

### The Antichrist and Signs of the End Times
The **Antichrist** is a figure described as arising during a period of persecution, who seeks to take Christ's place and deny him [02:15:53]. Some scholars view the Antichrist not as a single person but as a system that opposes Christ and offers false solutions [02:18:29]. The number 666 is interpreted as the "number of man," signifying perpetual incompleteness and falling short of divine perfection (represented by the number 7) [02:19:05].

Jesus described signs of the end times, including wars, famines, earthquakes, epidemics, and false prophets [02:19:50]. These signs have been continuously present since his time and are meant to assure believers of his future return, not to set a specific date [02:21:45].

## Salvation and the Christian Life
Salvation requires repentance from sins and faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior [02:22:52]. Baptism is an initiatory rite for identifying with the Christian community, not a requirement for salvation itself, as demonstrated by the thief on the cross [02:23:16].

### Sin and Personal Transformation
Even after conversion, a believer will continue to sin, but sin should be an "accident" rather than a known characteristic [02:50:36]. The human being is a complex "unity" (body, soul, spirit), and problems in one area affect the whole [02:54:09]. The image and likeness of God in humans refer to shared "communicable attributes" like love, justice, and creativity [02:56:11].

### Spiritual Warfare
The Bible teaches the existence of spiritual warfare, demons, and Satan, who accuse, tempt, and perform deceptive signs [03:36:00]. However, some modern movements, like "spiritual battle theology," tend to attribute all negative experiences to demonic influence, thereby negating individual responsibility and God's sovereign will [01:36:36]. God sometimes allows difficult situations not out of malice, but to get attention and prompt a return to Him [01:38:59]. True spiritual discernment is crucial to distinguish genuine spiritual cases from psychological issues [01:44:08].

### The Role of Angels
Angels were created with free will, and some rebelled against God, becoming fallen angels (demons) for whom there is no redemption [01:07:02]. Satan and other fallen angels operate invisibly among humanity, powerful enough to oppress and suggest [01:09:34]. They can have privileged knowledge of the future and perform deceptive miracles [01:29:43]. The Bible warns against seeking contact with angels or consulting the dead, as this is seen as an offense against God [01:33:08].

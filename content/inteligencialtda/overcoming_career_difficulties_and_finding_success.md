Emerson Ceará, a comedian who left Brazil's Northeast, a region with a strong industrial presence, to achieve success in Curitiba and eventually gain international recognition, has a career path marked by significant challenges and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. His journey exemplifies [[overcoming_personal_challenges_and_resilience | overcoming personal challenges and resilience]] through unconventional methods and sheer determination.

## Early Life and Ambitions

Emerson developed an early interest in theater, participating in school plays he even wrote himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. This passion, however, was hidden from his father, a "country guy" who was illiterate and forbade him from pursuing acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Despite his father's disapproval, Emerson secretly continued his theatrical endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

At 14, he attended a casting call for a movie called *Into the Clouds*, which was based on a real story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. He passed several stages, including singing Roberto Carlos songs and riding a bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The final test required a photo session with his family, necessitating parental permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Fearing his father's reaction, Emerson lied, stating his parents would not authorize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. The production team, however, visited his home and secured his father's signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Despite this, he did not get the role, a decision he later connected to his lack of artistic connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. This early experience made him "pissed off" and he never tried acting again for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

## Journey to Curitiba: A Series of Unforeseen Challenges

Emerson's move south began in 2006 when he was "fooled" into thinking Londrina was a city in Ceará <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. At 18, he traveled to Londrina, Paraná, with only R$72, the exact cost of his bus ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. He arrived with no money, subsisting on oranges and bananas, and relied on the kindness of a stranger for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

He began working as a peddler for a sales team, selling basic food baskets in Londrina and surrounding cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. He lived with eight other sales representatives, some of whom were criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. To navigate this dangerous environment, he resorted to lying, claiming he had "knocked down two motherfuckers" and had connections to the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. He found ways to gain favor, cooking for the group and doing their laundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. He also traded favors for cigarettes and beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

## Breaking into Hospitality: Waiter and Bartender

From Londrina, Emerson moved to Curitiba for a sales team opening, taking his personal belongings in a backpack, a habit from his days traveling with minimal necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. He lived in a shared house and sold oats door-to-door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. He later dated an older woman who welcomed him into her home, providing stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. He decided not to return to Ceará, as there were no opportunities for him there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

He then pursued his dream of becoming a waiter, inspired by the "decent job" he witnessed at a restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. He lied about his experience to get a job at a pizzeria, claiming he had worked at various restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. On his second day, he accidentally set the feijoada buffet on fire while trying to light the alcohol burner beneath it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. This incident, while embarrassing, did not get him fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

He then moved to a newly opened comedy bar, where he was initially hired as a waiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. However, when asked if he knew any bartenders, he lied again and said he could do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. He immediately went to a LAN house and Googled "classic drinks" to learn recipes, even printing them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. On opening night, with famous comedians like Danilo Gentili present, he managed to serve beer and soda while his colleagues handled the complex drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. He quickly became the "Big Chef" of the bar, teaching new hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. This period of [[personal_and_professional_growth | personal and professional growth]] also involved navigating the chaotic environment of a restaurant kitchen, which he described as a "mini hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

## Transition to Comedy: The Rough Start

Working at the comedy bar sparked Emerson's interest in stand-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. He observed comedians and believed he could also perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. His first performance for 15 people was "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. He persisted, writing new material, and despite working as a waiter, he used his free time to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

He entered a stand-up competition for a R$200 prize, describing it as one of the most embarrassing moments of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. He lost, continuing a pattern of always placing second or failing in competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. He faced criticism for his reliance on swearing in his jokes, which he later learned made his comedy "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

Emerson felt like an outsider in the comedy scene, experiencing [[challenges_and_experiences_in_the_comedy_industry | industry cliques and envy]] from other comedians, especially since he was a waiter performing better than some main acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. He wasn't invited to major comedy festivals or events, even struggling to get his wife to see a famous singer at an awards show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.

## Leveraging the Internet for Breakthrough

A turning point came when a fellow comedian suggested he tell his personal stories, noting his unique background of moving to an unknown city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. He began incorporating his life experiences into his jokes, finding a distinctive comedic voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

His real breakthrough came through the internet. He borrowed R$40,000 to invest in boosting his videos on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. Within three months, his phone began "popping pins" with calls for shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. He paid back the R$40,000 in seven months, primarily from ticket sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>. This success prompted him to open a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>. He credits the internet for significantly helping his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## National Recognition and Continued Growth

Emerson's online presence led to an invitation to appear on Faustão's television show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. Although he lost the competition, he was hired by Globo for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. He began performing solo shows in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

He continued to face challenges with established comedians and producers who controlled the venues and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>. Some were resistant to new talent or those not part of their "clique" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Despite this, he persevered, often performing in his waiter uniform after his shift, sometimes as a warm-up act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

He describes his journey as constantly "lying to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>. He believes in the importance of personal stories in comedy and adapting his style to audience feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of persistence, even when facing a "lowest point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:36">[02:25:36]</a>. He recalls a moment when he was struggling financially, eating only tea and popcorn, and almost gave up on comedy to return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. However, a friend urged him not to surrender, reminding him he was already there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>. His philosophy is to "jump with your eyes closed believing that the pool will be full" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>, highlighting the need for risk and faith in one's path.

Pânico na TV, a Brazilian comedy show that originated on radio and later moved to television, faced numerous challenges and controversies throughout its run due to its unique and often boundary-pushing humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. The show's style, initially perceived as "joking around between friends," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:09">[01:35:09]</a> often led to public outcry and internal pressures.

## Public Perception and Evolving Humor

The humor of Pânico, especially in its early days, was described as "clumsy" and involved interaction with "free humans," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a> where anything could happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This approach was highly successful at the time, making people feel like they were part of a "joking class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:57">[01:54:57]</a>. However, much of the content, if taken out of context today, would appear "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.

### Accusations of Fatphobia

One specific controversy mentioned involved accusations of fatphobia concerning a cast member, Kátia (also referred to as Sabrina) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. The speaker denies that Kátia suffered from fatphobia during her time on the show, suggesting she would not have stayed for 25 years if that were the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>. The show's creators argued that participants were not obliged to do anything they didn't want to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:11">[02:08:11]</a>.

## Dangerous Stunts and Legal Concerns

Pânico was known for its extreme stunts and segments, which often put cast members and the public at risk. These included:
*   Throwing things on the street that almost hit cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   The "ant hill" segment, where a cast member sat on an ant hill, resulting in thousands of bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:33">[01:34:33]</a>. This act caused severe burning and skin irritation, with effects lasting days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:48">[01:34:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">[01:35:07]</a>.
*   The "coffin on fire" segment, where a cast member was put in a coffin set on fire, almost suffocating from smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. This stunt was highly dangerous and required intervention from the production team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>.
*   Being hit by paintballs on the forehead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.
*   A segment involving a bee sting in the mouth, leading to severe swelling and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:22">[01:33:22]</a>.
*   Running over people, albeit with small clothes, a stunt that led to broken ribs and fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:43">[01:32:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

These dangerous stunts eventually led to self-imposed limits after a strong audience reaction and a call from a parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. The show recognized that some stunts "went too far," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a> such as throwing cockroaches at a woman's head, which could have been deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>.

> "This cockroach's head was because if by chance you will do you will you will doing there how cool it will work with The cool thing is that Oi's audience is increasingly and if you watch it not catch fire I I'll be sad then the cheap syllable gave cucumber What was it you went far too much to focus on garlic this could have dead I carry like this more dangerous already" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>

### Legal and Personal Challenges Faced by Marcelo

Marcelo, a cast member, faced [[legal_and_personal_challenges_faced_by_marcelo | legal and personal challenges]] due to his involvement in the show's controversial segments. One specific incident mentioned is a car fire after leaving a party in Jundiaí, which completely destroyed his vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:09">[02:02:09]</a>.

## Production and Financial Pressures

The show initially operated with limited resources. Emilio, one of the founders, even bought a camera with his own money in the first year because the show made "zero" profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:57">[04:43:57]</a>. The show later became a massive success, leading to increased budget and production quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

When Pânico transitioned to RedeTV!, there was an obligation to deliver audience results (IBOPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:04">[02:11:04]</a>. This pressure intensified once the show started generating significant revenue from sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:20">[02:15:20]</a>. The team had to attend weekly meetings to discuss minute-by-minute audience data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:09">[03:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. The constant need for high ratings led to high stress levels among the cast, as they had to consistently deliver engaging content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:24">[02:21:24]</a>.

The show's move to Band also involved financial considerations and a need to maintain audience numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:27">[03:26:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:35">[03:36:35]</a>.

## Talent Management and Departure

Pânico provided a platform for many to achieve fame, but this also brought challenges. Some individuals who gained popularity through the show, such as "Penguin," were later hired directly by RedeTV! <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>.

Cast departures, like those of Ceará and Sabrina, also impacted the show's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:58">[01:52:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:33">[01:53:33]</a>. These changes, at times, created a "bad atmosphere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:08">[01:53:08]</a>. The show had to constantly reinvent itself to remain relevant and overcome these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>.

## Evolution of Humor and Audience Expectations

Over time, the audience's expectations for humor changed, and the show had to adapt. The original, raw humor was difficult to replicate in later years due to increased scrutiny and audience sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a>. The transition from radio to TV meant adapting the content from purely auditory jokes to visual stunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:41">[03:29:41]</a>.

The show, known for its ability to "take off the pedestal" celebrities and make fun of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>, eventually faced the challenge of its own humor becoming dated or controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>. The shift in what was considered acceptable or funny meant the show experienced a "drought" of ideas, as certain types of content were no longer feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:53">[02:08:53]</a>. The changing landscape of television, with declining overall viewership for traditional broadcasts, also played a role in the show's eventual decline in ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_in_the_entertainment_industry | challenges]], Pânico na TV is remembered for its significant cultural impact, especially in revolutionizing humor in Brazilian television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

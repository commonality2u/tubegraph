[[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Jair Bolsonaro's presidency]] (2019-2022) saw significant shifts in Brazil's economic and social policies, largely driven by a stated aim to reduce state intervention, combat corruption, and foster economic growth.

## Economic Policies

### Combating Corruption and Bloated State
[[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] characterized the previous [[discussions_on_government_policies_and_economic_impacts_in_brazil | PT government]] as marked by "unbelievable" corruption, particularly in the case of Petrobras, which accumulated R$900 billion in debt partly due to price interference [00:58:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>, [00:59:59]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>). He cited former minister Palocci's statements about widespread corruption, noting R$16 billion returned by whistleblowers and companies [00:37:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>).

A major point of concern was the diversion of R$45 billion from pension funds (Petrobras, Caixa Econômica, Post Office), leading to continued payroll discounts for employees until 2030 to restore financial health [00:37:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>).

**Reducing State Size and Bureaucracy:**
The administration aimed to reduce the size of the state, which was described as "bloated" [00:46:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>).
*   **Ministry Reduction:** The number of ministries was reduced from 39 to 23 [00:46:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>, [00:47:09]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>).
*   **Ending Wasteful Spending:** Identified examples of wasteful spending included R$50 million spent by FUNAI to teach Indigenous people Bitcoin [00:47:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>), and excessive spending on consultancies [00:48:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>).
*   **[[economic_policies_and_privatization_in_brazil | Economic Freedom Law]] (2019):** This law significantly debureaucratized and deregulated processes. For instance, if a city hall doesn't respond to a business permit request within 30 days, the business can open [00:49:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>). Regulatory standards for businesses were reduced by 90% [00:50:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>).
*   **IBAMA and Fines:** Legislation regarding environmental fines by IBAMA was adjusted, focusing on warnings before fines [00:51:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>).

### Fiscal and Employment Policies
*   **Public Sector Hiring:** New public servant competitions were largely restricted to essential areas like federal and highway police, as the "machine is swollen" [00:51:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>).
*   **Salaries and Minimum Wage:** Public servants did not receive adjustments for three years due to the pandemic [00:52:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>). However, an announcement by Paulo Guedes indicated a real increase in the minimum wage and public servant salaries for the following year [00:52:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>, [01:31:01]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>).
*   **Fuel Prices:** The reduction in fuel prices was attributed to a reduction in taxes, not interference with Petrobras [00:56:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>). Federal taxes on gasoline were zeroed [01:00:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>). This legislative change aimed to reduce prices without accumulating losses for Petrobras, unlike previous "pen stroke" policies [00:58:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>).

### Infrastructure and Energy
The government focused on completing infrastructure projects, eliminating bottlenecks, and promoting [[economic_policies_and_privatization_in_brazil | privatization]] through concessions.
*   **Highways and Bridges:** Invested in completing highways, like the BR-163, and building bridges [00:46:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>).
*   **Concessions:** Airports, ports, and highways were subjects of concessions, such as the Dutra Highway contract [00:46:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>, [02:00:49]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:49">[02:00:49]</a>). Toll prices were reduced, and motorcycles were exempt [02:01:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:05">[02:01:05]</a>).
*   **Energy Production:** Promoted wind power offshore, particularly in the Northeast, with potential to generate energy equivalent to 50 Itaipus [00:54:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>). Also restarted construction of Angra 3 nuclear power plant [00:54:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>). New PCHs (small hydroelectric plants) were being built, contributing to energy generation and fish farming [02:27:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:18">[02:27:18]</a>).
*   **Lithium Exploration:** Opened the Jequitinhonha Valley in Minas Gerais for lithium exploration, aiming for self-sufficiency in battery production [00:56:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>).
*   **Refineries:** Highlighted the abandonment of three planned refineries during the [[discussions_on_government_policies_and_economic_impacts_in_brazil | PT era]], which cost R$90 billion and prevented Brazil from being self-sufficient in diesel and an exporter of gasoline [00:57:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>).

### Agriculture (Agro)
Brazil, once an importer of food in the 1970s, became a global agricultural power [02:10:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:05">[02:10:05]</a>, [02:10:44]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:44">[02:10:44]</a>).
*   **Fertilizer Dependence:** Brazil remains dependent on imported fertilizers, particularly from Russia, a key reason for [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro's]] visit to Russia in February [02:10:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>, [02:11:46]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:46">[02:11:46]</a>). The government aims to encourage domestic exploration of fertilizer resources, especially in Indigenous territories [02:12:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:50">[02:12:50]</a>).
*   **Indigenous Lands:** A bill was proposed to allow Indigenous people to explore resources on their lands, provided they consent freely and spontaneously [02:11:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>).
*   **Family Farming:** The government titled 420,000 land possessions, providing farmers with documentation to seek financing and motivation to work, contributing to the pacification of the MST issue [02:13:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:43">[02:13:43]</a>, [02:24:25]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25">[02:24:25]</a>). Land invasions by the MST significantly decreased under [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | his government]] [02:24:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:41">[02:24:41]</a>).
*   **Fish Farming:** Negotiations with the Paraguayan Parliament aim to increase fish production by 40% in Lake Itaipu, with a new policy eliminating federal taxes on fish feed [02:26:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:06">[02:26:06]</a>).

## Social Policies

### Pandemic Response
[[controversies_and_criticisms_faced_by_bolsonaro | Bolsonaro]] viewed the pandemic as the most difficult moment of [[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | his presidency]] [02:33:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:31">[02:33:31]</a>).
*   **Emergency Aid:** The government implemented R$600 emergency aid to support informal workers and those forced to stay home [02:53:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:10">[02:53:10]</a>). This was described as three times more than the Bolsa Família program [02:59:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:33">[02:59:33]</a>).
*   **"Stay at Home" Policy:** [[controversies_and_criticisms_faced_by_bolsonaro | Bolsonaro]] consistently opposed widespread lockdowns, arguing that while COVID-19 caused deaths, a "not working" policy would lead to many more deaths from depression and anxiety [02:17:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:13">[02:17:13]</a>). He believed only the elderly and those with comorbidities should isolate [02:07:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>).
*   **Vaccine Procurement:** [[controversies_and_criticisms_faced_by_bolsonaro | Bolsonaro]] stated that Brazil was one of the countries that "proportionally better vaccinated" its population [01:13:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>). He emphasized that in 2020, vaccines were not available globally [01:08:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>). He raised concerns about contract clauses that would make Brazil responsible for side effects and mentioned that Pfizer's director admitted no tests were done to confirm if vaccinated individuals could transmit the virus [01:08:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>, [01:13:42]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>, [01:14:44]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>). He also highlighted Anvisa's warnings about symptoms in children aged 5-11 after vaccination [01:11:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>).
*   **Alternative Treatments:** [[controversies_and_criticisms_faced_by_bolsonaro | Bolsonaro]] mentioned two unproven medicines that doctors were "prevented from administering" due to "absurd pressure" [02:33:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:43">[02:33:43]</a>). He stated that some prisoners, who took medicine for common ailments in prison, did not die from COVID-19 [02:19:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>, [02:19:41]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:41">[02:19:41]</a>).

### Social Issues and Values
[[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] presented [[brazilian_politics_and_governance | his government]] as a counterpoint to perceived left-wing agendas, focusing on "conservative agendas" and "family values" [03:57:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:37">[03:57:37]</a>).
*   **LGBTQ+ Issues:** He stated he is not homophobic and supports gay marriage, viewing it as a right to "suffer too" within marriage [00:36:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>, [00:36:42]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>, [00:36:48]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>). He opposed "gender ideology" being taught to children in classrooms [00:36:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, [02:10:00]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>).
*   **Drug Legalization:** He maintained a stance "against the release of drugs" [00:36:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>, [02:09:49]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:49">[02:09:49]</a>).
*   **Abortion:** Stated that he is against abortion, highlighting that the issue could be approved by the Supreme Federal Court if two more pro-abortion ministers were appointed [02:10:00]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, [02:11:34]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:34">[02:11:34]</a>).
*   **Reduction of Criminal Responsibility:** Advocated for reducing the age of criminal responsibility, arguing that 16 or 17-year-olds committing crimes with impunity is a "shame" [02:18:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:11">[02:18:11]</a>).
*   **Pedophilia:** Accused the [[discussions_on_government_policies_and_economic_impacts_in_brazil | PT]] of attempting to lower the age of "vulnerable rape" from 14 to 12 years [02:20:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:30">[02:20:30]</a>). He also cited a [[discussions_on_government_policies_and_economic_impacts_in_brazil | PT]]-linked website that suggested taking pedophiles to hospitals, not police stations, due to "disorder" [02:21:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:12">[02:21:12]</a>).

## Other Relevant Policies

### Media and Censorship
[[controversies_and_criticisms_faced_by_bolsonaro | Bolsonaro]] expressed concern over what he perceived as prior censorship by the STF/TSE, stating that it's "dangerous" [01:39:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:48">[01:39:48]</a>). He lamented that his government "garroted advertising expenses" for official government media, leading to a negative portrayal by much of the press [01:13:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>). He noted that despite reduced employees, TV Brasil's viewership increased, becoming the 5th most viewed TV in Brazil [01:59:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:49">[01:59:49]</a>, [02:30:28]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a>).

### "Secret Budget"
[[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] clarified that the "secret budget" was created by Parliament in his second year of government (2020), not by him [01:32:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>). He explained that he vetoed the proposal, but the veto was overturned by Congress, including [[discussions_on_government_policies_and_economic_impacts_in_brazil | PT]] votes [01:33:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:23">[01:33:23]</a>, [01:33:53]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>). This budget, an "amendment rapporteur's amendment," allocates approximately R$15 billion per year to the Chamber and Senate, distributed by a rapporteur [01:31:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:16">[01:31:16]</a>, [01:34:10]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>). He stated that the government doesn't know the names of the parliamentarians who request the funds for specific municipalities, leading to its "secret" designation [01:35:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>).

### More Cuban Doctors Program (Mais Médicos Cubanos)
[[jair_bolsonaros_political_career_and_presidency | Bolsonaro]] criticized the "More Cuban Doctors" program from the [[discussions_on_government_policies_and_economic_impacts_in_brazil | PT government]], stating that out of a R$12,000 monthly salary, R$9,500 went to Fidel Castro's dictatorship [02:25:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, [02:25:07]](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:07">[02:25:07]</a>). He argued this was a form of "rachadinha" (kickback scheme) on a large scale [02:29:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>). His administration ended the program, leading Cuban doctors to flee Brazil, as he intended to require revalidation for their licenses [02:25:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:46">[02:25:46]</a>).

Alzheimer's disease is recognized as the most common neurodegenerative disease and the most severe type of dementia currently known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:25">[01:39:25]</a>. It is characterized by the death of neurons in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:29">[01:39:29]</a>. While some neuronal loss is a normal part of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>, Alzheimer's involves an acceleration of this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:47">[01:39:47]</a>.

## Pathophysiology

The disease is associated with the buildup of amyloid plaques in the patient's brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:28">[01:42:28]</a>. These plaques release a toxic peptide called beta-amyloid, which is harmful to neurons, causing them to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:43">[01:42:43]</a>.

## Risk Factors

Several factors are known to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's:
*   **Chronic Stress** Chronic stress is considered the main risk factor for developing depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a> and can lead to the death of neurons, including dopamine-producing neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:45">[01:40:45]</a>.
*   **Pesticides** Certain pesticides are seen as a significant problem in the development of Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:05">[01:42:05]</a>.
*   **[[type_2_diabetes | Type 2 Diabetes]]** Patients with [[type_2_diabetes | Type 2 diabetes]] (acquired insulin resistance due to diet and lifestyle) are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>.
*   **Genetics** Only about 3% of all Alzheimer's cases are purely genetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>. If a family member has this genetic form, there is a higher chance of developing it, often starting earlier and being more aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Mental Stimulation** The brain is like a muscle; the more it is used and exposed to different things, the more protected it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:11">[02:46:11]</a>. People who engage in repetitive work throughout their lives, such as nuns who read the same stories and prayers, show a higher propensity for Alzheimer's because they do not offer their brains diverse stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:37">[02:46:37]</a>. Conversely, learning a second language can halve the chances of developing the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:28">[02:46:28]</a>.

## Symptoms and Diagnosis

Contrary to popular belief, the first symptom of Alzheimer's is often not memory loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:57">[01:42:57]</a>. Patients often begin with mood problems, such as depression and anxiety, due to neuron death in regions of the brain involved with these emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>. Memory loss typically develops later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>. A major challenge in treating Alzheimer's today is the difficulty in early detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:26">[01:43:26]</a>.

## Treatment and Prevention

Currently, there are no disease-modifying drugs that can reverse Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:38">[01:43:38]</a>. Existing medications primarily aim to slow down the progression of the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.

### Physical Activity
Physical activity is seen as an important tool for preventing and even aiding in the treatment of Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>. Studies show that muscle contraction during physical activity releases a hormone called irisin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:31">[01:44:31]</a>. This hormone travels to the brain, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and helps prevent beta-amyloid peptides from being toxic to neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:43">[01:44:43]</a>.

### Cognitive Engagement
Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, such as learning a second language, can significantly protect the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:28">[02:46:28]</a>. The more one uses their brain for diverse activities, the more new connections are formed, akin to strengthening a muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:16">[02:47:16]</a>.

## Advancements in [[Neuroscience and Brain Research | Brain Research]]

### Mapping Brain Regions
The advent of [[neuroscience_and_brain_research | neuroimaging]] studies, particularly functional MRI (fMRI), has allowed researchers to map brain regions and understand their functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:58">[01:45:58]</a>. By observing which areas consume more glucose during specific tasks, scientists can infer their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>. Injuries have also historically provided insights into brain function, such as the case of Phineas Gage, who survived a pipe passing through his prefrontal cortex, demonstrating this region is not essential for basic life functions but impacts complex behaviors like impulse control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:56">[02:39:56]</a>. Similarly, the study of patient H.M., who had his hippocampus removed, revealed that this region is crucial for forming new explicit memories, but not for motor memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:24">[02:42:24]</a>.

### Brain Plasticity
The brain's ability to change and adapt, known as neuroplasticity, is highest during childhood and early adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:17">[01:36:17]</a>. This "neuroplastic window" allows children to learn new languages and skills much more easily than adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:21">[01:36:21]</a>. While the brain becomes more "concrete" after age 25-30, learning is still possible but requires greater effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:51">[01:36:51]</a>. The brain also demonstrates an ability to compensate for damage, especially if the injury occurs early in life, with other regions developing functionalities of the impaired area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:31">[02:44:31]</a>.

### Default Mode Network (DMN)
Discovered in the 2000s, the Default Mode Network is a brain network that activates when individuals are not engaged in external tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>. Studies show that patients with depression have a more active DMN, which explains why they often live introspectively and struggle to engage with the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:25">[01:48:25]</a>. Behavioral activation therapies for depression aim to encourage patients to perform simple tasks, which deactivates the DMN and promotes engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>.

### Deep Brain Stimulation
Deep brain stimulation involves surgically implanting electrodes in specific brain regions to modulate their activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:27">[01:58:27]</a>. Studies, like one by Helen Mayberg, have shown its effectiveness in treating severe, treatment-resistant depression by inhibiting an overactive cingulate cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>. Recent advancements include portable electroencephalograms that monitor brain activity and stimulate reward systems when patterns indicative of sadness are detected, demonstrating a "closed-loop" system that self-corrects mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:21">[02:01:21]</a>.

### Memory Transplantation
[[Neuroscience and Brain Function | Research]] by Susumu Tonegawa has shown the ability to transplant trauma memories between rats using optogenetics, a technique that activates specific populations of neurons (engrams) with light stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:43">[01:54:43]</a>. This research indicates that memories are stored as information within neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a> and that memories with emotional content are more likely to be retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:38">[02:05:38]</a>.

### Brain-Machine Interface
Projects like Elon Musk's Neuralink are advancing the field of brain-machine interfaces, aiming to map and connect thousands of neurons to external devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>. While complex due to the unique organization of neurons in each individual, significant progress has been made in mapping motor cortex activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.

## Related Topics for Overall Brain Health

### Dopamine and Modern Society
Dopamine is primarily associated with motivation and the anticipation of pleasure, not pleasure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:06">[03:00:06]</a>. Modern society presents a mismatch with our dopaminergic system, as constant, easy access to highly rewarding stimuli (e.g., food, alcohol, pornography, social media likes) leads to a "downregulation" of dopamine receptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:51">[02:57:51]</a>. This can result in decreased baseline (tonic) dopamine, making individuals feel unmotivated and needing more intense stimuli to feel satisfaction, similar to addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:15">[03:06:15]</a>. This phenomenon also makes it harder for people to tolerate boredom or simple activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>.

### Sleep Hygiene
Proper sleep is crucial for emotional control and overall brain function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:01">[02:24:01]</a>. The brain's internal clock (suprachiasmatic nucleus with clock genes) regulates the circadian rhythm, which is heavily influenced by natural light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:53">[02:17:53]</a>.
Tips for improving sleep:
*   Maintain a consistent wake-up time, even on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>.
*   Expose yourself to natural light for 30 minutes upon waking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:50">[02:24:50]</a>.
*   Avoid caffeine after 3 PM due to its long half-life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:04">[02:25:04]</a>.
*   Reduce exposure to blue light (screens) at night; use yellow filters or dim, warm lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:26">[02:25:26]</a>.
*   Minimize noise in the bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>.
*   Avoid mentally demanding work at least three hours before bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>.
*   Reserve the bed for sexual activity and sleep only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:01">[02:28:01]</a>.
*   If waking up in the middle of the night, avoid looking at the clock to prevent anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>.

### [[Challenges of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD | ADHD]]
Patients with [[challenges_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_adhd | ADHD]] often have a decrease in dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, leading to difficulties with sustained focus and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>. They also exhibit a distortion in time perception, overestimating the time required for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. Conversely, individuals without [[challenges_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_adhd | ADHD]] who take medications like Ritalin or Venvanse can impair their learning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. Despite challenges, many individuals with [[challenges_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_adhd | ADHD]] are highly intelligent and can achieve hyperfocus in areas of high interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>. There is also a higher prevalence of substance use among [[challenges_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_adhd | ADHD]] patients, as they seek to compensate for lower tonic dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.

### Meditation (Mindfulness)
Mindfulness meditation, which involves focusing attention on the present moment, is highly effective for emotional control and reducing anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:43">[03:17:43]</a>. It helps activate the prefrontal cortex and decrease activity in limbic system regions associated with anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:34">[03:41:34]</a>.

### [[Challenges of human perception and cognition | Personality Disorders]]
[[Psychopathy and Brain Functioning | Borderline personality disorder]], often confused with bipolar disorder, involves a disconnect in communication between the prefrontal cortex and limbic system, leading to difficulties in impulse control and emotional regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:02">[02:53:02]</a>. Autistic spectrum disorder is also a spectrum of neurodevelopmental conditions, characterized by difficulties in "theory of mind" (understanding others' feelings) and interpreting biological movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:15">[02:56:15]</a>. Early intervention is crucial for improving prognosis in autism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

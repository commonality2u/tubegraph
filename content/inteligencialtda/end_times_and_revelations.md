From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

The contemporary global landscape, including events like the COVID-19 pandemic, are seen by some as potential [[End Times and Signs of the Coming | signs of the end times]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. Biblical prophecies mention signs in nature such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. The Bible also speaks of nations being "perplexed by the roaring of the sea and the waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>. This concept of global awareness aligns with modern communication, as events 50 kilometers away can now be seen by the entire world, unlike in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>. This global visibility is also alluded to in Revelation, where the world rejoices and exchanges gifts over the death of two witnesses whose bodies lie in a public square, an event that could only be witnessed universally through modern technology like the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

## Interpretations of Revelation

The speaker approaches [[Interpretations of Revelation | interpretations of Revelation]] and [[Biblical prophecies and eschatology | biblical prophecies]] from a specific theological perspective, finding them to be "tragic" and "heavy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. He emphasizes basing theological interpretations on biblical texts rather than human logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.

### The Great Tribulation and Daniel's Prophecy

The concept of the "great tribulation" refers to a seven-year period derived from the Book of Daniel, Chapter 9:24-27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. Daniel is considered the first apocalyptic prophet, and his book shares many commonalities with Revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.

Daniel's prophecy outlines "70 weeks," which are understood as "weeks of years," totaling 490 years (70 x 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>.
*   The first 69 weeks (483 years) are prophesied to span from the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the death of Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>.
*   A "hiatus" or gap exists between the 69th and 70th week, which represents the current Church Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:11">[02:44:11]</a>.
*   Crucially, these 70 weeks are specifically intended for the Jewish people and Jerusalem, not the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

### The Rapture

The speaker adheres to a premillennial pretribulationist view, believing that the church will be raptured *before* the seven-year tribulation period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:09">[02:08:09]</a>. Rapture, from the Greek "harpazo," means to be "kidnapped" or "snatched away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:32">[02:01:32]</a>. This event involves believers, both living and dead, being caught up to meet Jesus in the air, distinct from Jesus' second coming to Earth *with* the church after the tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:46">[02:01:46]</a>.

According to 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, those who died in Christ will be resurrected first, followed by living believers who will be "caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:17">[02:13:17]</a>.

### The Antichrist and False Prophet

The final "week" of Daniel's prophecy (the 70th week) is initiated by a peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:36">[02:44:36]</a>. The Antichrist, who comes as a "man of peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>, will propose this agreement. He is identified as a political leader, possibly from a "big megacorporation" or a major economic power, rather than a religious one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>. The Antichrist is believed to descend from the Roman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:05">[02:34:05]</a>, with his origin potentially being European or Muslim, but likely a Western man with a Muslim background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:19">[02:15:19]</a>.

The agreement he proposes will likely allow Israel to rebuild their Temple on Mount Moriah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>. This location is currently occupied by the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The Temple would be built in a specific area that does not require dismantling existing structures, possibly aligning with the Golden Gate which, according to prophecy, will only be reopened upon the Messiah's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a>. The Temple Institute in Jerusalem has already prepared all necessary utensils for its rebuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:01">[03:02:01]</a>.

Alongside the Antichrist, a "false prophet" will emerge, who is a religious leader promoting unity among religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:21">[02:52:21]</a>. This false prophet will appear lamb-like but will direct worship toward the Antichrist, proclaiming him as the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:45">[02:52:45]</a>.

In the middle of the seven-year tribulation, the Antichrist will break the peace agreement. He will enter the Holy of Holies in the rebuilt Temple, declaring himself to be God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:05">[02:28:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:12">[02:38:12]</a>. This act will initiate intense persecution against those who do not accept his mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:05">[03:08:05]</a>.

### The Mark of the Beast (666)

The [[Symbolism in the Book of Revelation | symbolism in the Book of Revelation]] includes the number 666 and the Mark of the Beast. The speaker suggests that 666 represents the "system" that will control the world, linked to the "www" (World Wide Web) prefix, as the Hebrew letter "vav" (waw), which translates to 'w', also represents the number 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:47">[02:19:47]</a>. Therefore, www can be seen as 666 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:46">[02:20:46]</a>.

The Mark of the Beast itself is a "haragma," which can be a tattoo, a wound, or a subcutaneously introduced element like a chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:09">[02:21:09]</a>. This mark, placed on the wrist or forehead, will be essential for economic participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:27">[02:21:27]</a>, enforcing compliance within a cashless, digital economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:30">[02:22:30]</a>. This global control system, enabled by technologies like 5G, will increase societal subservience to the Antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:18">[02:22:18]</a>. The speaker also proposes that nano-robots might be introduced into the brain, creating a "hybrid brain" and facilitating transhumanism, which he likens to the sin of the Nephilim in Noah's day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:02">[02:23:02]</a>.

### Premillennialism vs. Preterism

The speaker outlines [[Different interpretations of eschatology and end times | different interpretations of eschatology and end times]]:
*   **Premillennial Pretribulationists:** Believe the rapture occurs before the tribulation. This is the speaker's view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:09">[02:08:09]</a>.
*   **Posttribulationists:** Believe the rapture occurs at the end of the tribulation. Their argument rests on Saints dying during the persecution of the Antichrist in the second half of the tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>.
*   **Preterists:** Believe that all of Revelation's prophecies were fulfilled by 70 AD, with Nero being the Antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:20">[02:02:20]</a>. The speaker dismisses this as a "very weak theory," citing the lack of a mark of the beast or a false prophet during Nero's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:08">[02:03:08]</a>. Preterists also believe Satan is already imprisoned because the church is currently reigning, which the speaker contends is inconsistent with current global tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:45">[02:03:45]</a>.

### The Holy Spirit and the End Times

The speaker emphasizes that during the tribulation, the Holy Spirit will not indwell believers as He does now, but will still act externally, enabling conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>. The period of the church began with the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost and will end with the rapture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:23">[02:26:23]</a>.

### Spiritual Warfare and Territoriality

Spiritual warfare is a significant aspect of the [[Biblical eschatology and prophecy | end times perspective]]. Demons possess territoriality, often aligning with human demarcations like nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. Powerful angelic beings, like Michael, engage in these battles against demonic principalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>. The Devil and his fallen angels have access to the Earth and the "second heaven" (the realm of spiritual wickedness), but not the "third heaven" where God's throne resides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. While the Devil might achieve "punctual victories," God continuously raises people to break through these barriers and transform lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. The speaker encourages prayer and repentance as means to overcome spiritual strongholds and bring healing to the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

Raquel Pacheco's journey has been significantly shaped by her experiences with [[role_of_family_and_its_challenges | family]] rejection and adoption. Her story, detailed in her autobiography "Eternal Bruna Surfistinha" and its film adaptation, highlights the profound impact of [[personal_challenges_and_family_impact | personal challenges and family impact]].

## Childhood and Adoption Discovery
Raquel grew up as an adopted child, a fact she discovered at a very young age, between four and five years old </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:57">[02:58:57]</a>. This early revelation, while potentially intended for good, caused significant "mental confusion" for her as a child who couldn't fully process the information </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:09">[02:59:09]</a>. Her adoptive mother's blunt delivery, stating Raquel "didn't come out of my belly" and had "a mother or a father" elsewhere, left her feeling deeply confused </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>. This led to a pervasive "feeling of rejection" that Raquel admits she still "has to work a lot" on today </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.

She always felt like a "strange" child, observing adults and feeling like she didn't "belong" to her immediate [[role_of_family_and_its_challenges | family]] environment </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:22">[02:28:22]</a>. Her parents were older, both over 50 when she was born, creating a significant "generation gap" between them and her older sisters </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>. She remembers her earliest memory being with her paternal grandfather, who later passed away when she was less than two years old </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:20">[01:55:20]</a>. This grandfather had left her a watch he promised her when she was 10, a testament to a connection that was cut short </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:20">[01:56:20]</a>.

## Adolescence and Rebellion
As a teenager, Raquel's desire for attention, coupled with a growing sense of rebellion, led her to act out. While once an excellent student, always getting high grades, she felt a lack of attention from her parents when she was "all right" </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:55">[02:39:55]</a>. She eventually became rebellious, starting to smoke and engage in forbidden activities </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:31">[02:31:31]</a>. She realized that "doing wrong" caught her parents' attention </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>. Her parents, particularly her father, had a very "closed mind" regarding sexuality and social norms, viewing women as either "decent" or "whores" </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This rigid upbringing meant there was "no communication" at home </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:48">[02:54:48]</a>.

Her relationship with her parents deteriorated further due to her choices in boyfriends, as her father had specific expectations for his daughters' partners </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:15">[03:42:15]</a>. When he discovered her first boyfriend was an "office boy," he became enraged, feeling that his investments in her education were being wasted </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:42">[03:48:42]</a>.

## Leaving Home and its Aftermath
The culmination of her rebellion and strained [[personal_challenges_and_family_impact | family dynamics]] came when Raquel, at 17, started stealing money from her parents to fund her addictions </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>. This included selling her mother's valuable jewelry set for a fraction of its worth </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. When her mother discovered the theft, she eventually informed Raquel's father </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:55">[05:09:55]</a>. Her father reacted violently, physically assaulting her and verbally abusing her, calling her a "whore" and a "thief" </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

This incident marked a turning point. Her parents began treating her "as a stranger" and a "bandit," locking doors and restricting her access to most of the house </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:55">[05:52:55]</a>. This period of [[navigating_personal_and_professional_challenges | navigating personal and professional challenges]] led to her decision to run away from home at 17 </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.

Her father's decision to cut off her therapy sessions further isolated her </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. Raquel admits this might have helped her maintain emotional balance and perhaps delay her departure </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. Feeling a profound "not belonging anywhere" and "lost," she contemplated suicide </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:56">[02:15:56]</a>. However, a moment of reflection and a deep desire to fulfill her dreams, like becoming a mother, made her choose to live and "live the life I want to live" </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>.

## Entry into Prostitution
With no other options, Raquel turned to prostitution as a means of survival and independence. She saw it as the "easiest" option as it covered housing expenses </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. Her first day was daunting due to her inexperience, but she adopted the name "Bruna" to create a new persona, effectively separating herself from "little Raquel" </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>. This new identity helped her overcome her shyness in this new world </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:10">[02:23:10]</a>.

She views prostitution as a "very transparent" relationship where "no one fools anyone" </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:53">[01:37:53]</a>. She also believes her past influenced her choice, as she "wanted to hurt my father too in a way" by becoming the "whore" he feared she would be </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:39">[03:54:39]</a>.

## Current Family Life and Reflection
Raquel is now a mother to twin daughters, born last year </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. She and her fianc√© are fully dedicated to raising them, describing their household as "100% paternity" and "100% motherhood" </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:21">[03:44:21]</a>. This new [[family_and_personal_life_developments | family and personal life developments]] has made her reflect deeply on her own upbringing. She wants her daughters to "learn in love," not "through pain," a direct contrast to her own experiences </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:31">[05:59:31]</a>.

Her adoptive father passed away in 2011 </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. She has no direct contact with her adoptive mother today, although she sometimes checks her social media to ensure she is well </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:06">[03:28:06]</a>. She made attempts to reconnect, sending flowers and letters, but her mother made it clear there was "no more chance" for reconciliation </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:08">[03:29:08]</a>. Raquel has come to understand that this relationship was a "circle that needed to close" for both parties </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:33">[03:30:33]</a>. She believes her escape was a "way of asking for help" and getting attention from her parents, who were not prepared to understand her </a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:32">[03:31:32]</a>.

Despite the challenges, Raquel has come to terms with her past. Her story, including her [[recovery_from_drug_use_and_personal_growth | recovery from drug use and personal growth]], became a best-selling book and a successful movie, allowing her to share her experiences with a wider audience.

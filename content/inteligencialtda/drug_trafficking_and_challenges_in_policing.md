Sergeant Fahur, a retired Military Police officer and current Federal Deputy, shares his extensive experiences combating drug trafficking and the inherent challenges in policing, particularly on highways and in urban areas.

## Police Operations and Drug Seizures
Sergeant Fahur's policing career, particularly his time with the highway police, was heavily focused on interdicting illegal goods and substances [00:33:53]. His strategy often involved approaching buses, trucks, and cars on highways to inspect for contraband [00:27:56].

### Detecting Drug Mules
On his last day of service, Sergeant Fahur recounts a successful bust on a bus coming from Foz do Iguaçu. He observed a young woman in seat 16 who appeared "disoriented" and "bothered" when approached, leading him to suspect she was a mule [00:28:26]. Her refusal to acknowledge her luggage, which the bus driver confirmed was hers via a tag, further solidified suspicions [00:29:29]. The bag contained approximately 12 kg of marijuana [00:30:07]. A subsequent phone call to the mule's phone led to the arrest of another woman at the bus station, who had an additional 10 kg of marijuana. They were girlfriends who traveled on separate buses to mitigate risk, but the phone call exposed their collusion [00:30:40]. The younger woman was a minor, leading to charges of both trafficking and corruption of minors [00:32:41].

### Hidden Compartments and Smuggling Techniques
Police experience is crucial in identifying hidden compartments. Sergeant Fahur gives examples:
*   **Monza Fuel Tank** On a rainy day, a car with a couple was stopped, and a police dog, after an initial failed attempt by another dog, went "crazy" at the fuel tank. Inside, officers found four bricks of expensive cocaine, compartmentalized from the fuel [00:41:45]. This highlights the use of police dogs and the elaborate methods smugglers employ.
*   **Furniture** A truck driver, suspicious after his employer disappeared, reported his truck to the police. Inside a wardrobe, a large wooden box with aluminum plating was found. Its thick sides were hollowed out and stuffed with marijuana [01:14:05].
*   **Vehicle Bodywork** The interiors of vehicles are often stripped to create more space for contraband. For instance, the door panels of an S10 truck were ripped out to fit more cigarette boxes [00:59:07]. Smugglers also install devices to emit black smoke during pursuits [00:58:14].

### Types of Contraband Encountered
Beyond drugs, Sergeant Fahur's teams frequently seized a wide array of contraband:
*   **Cigarettes** Large quantities of cigarettes are smuggled, often in cars with modified interiors to hold 30-35 boxes [01:13:09]. Trucks might carry 600-800 boxes, sometimes with a "beater" car scouting the road ahead [01:10:06].
*   **Electronics and Pirated Goods** Buses often carried pirated CDs for video games, cell phone screens, and entire disassembled cell phones as spare parts [01:36:45].
*   **Toys** Bulky but common, electronic toys were often found in colorful bags [01:37:33].
*   **Pharmaceuticals** Prohibited or controlled medications like strong rheumatism drugs (Cytotec abortives), Viagra, and Sibutramine (for weight loss) were seized [01:47:47]. The speaker notes that Brazilian law considers drug smuggling a more serious crime than drug trafficking [01:52:03]. Anabolic steroids, including those for horses, are also frequently seized [01:54:55].
*   **Hookah Essence and Electronic Cigarettes** These items also became prevalent contraband during his career [02:00:36].
*   **Weapons** Besides firearms and ammunition (like 3,000 rifle rounds on one bus) [02:17:57], realistic Airsoft weapons, used for robberies or sold to shooting clubs, were also seized [01:00:15].
*   **Counterfeit Goods** The police found factories producing counterfeit packaging for expensive German bearings, which were then filled with inferior products [01:30:30].
*   **Human Trafficking** Sergeant Fahur also encountered individuals entering Brazil illegally, including Haitians and Arab families without proper visas [01:34:39].

## Challenges in Policing
Sergeant Fahur highlights numerous challenges faced by police officers:

### Public Perception and Misinformation
The public often underestimates the effort required for seizures. People assume large drug busts are due to snitching or that drug dealers can easily bypass checkpoints, ignoring the countless hours of fruitless patrols and inspections [01:44:52]. There's a common misconception that police are "crystal ball" readers rather than relying on experience and observation [01:46:09].

### Legal and Bureaucratic Hurdles
*   **Plea Bargains/Snitching** The Sergeant recounts a personal incident from his youth where a friend "reported" him for graffitiing to avoid punishment [01:11:16]. This experience gave him early insight into such dynamics.
*   **Judicial Fragility** He notes cases where individuals caught with large quantities of drugs are quickly released, leading to recidivism [01:43:52].
*   **Minors in Crime** Dealing with pregnant minors involved in trafficking adds a layer of complexity, requiring involvement of the Guardianship Council [01:25:24].
*   **"Mules" and Lack of Evidence** When carriers deny knowledge of contraband, and no direct evidence links them to ownership, delegates may opt for an inquiry rather than immediate arrest, especially if the person seems genuinely unaware or has a plausible story [01:16:39]. This highlights the difficulty in proving intent.
*   **Illegal Entry** When illegal immigrants are apprehended, the police often transport them to Federal Police, but deportation requires judicial authorization and financial costs, leading to a "revolving door" where many return [01:35:38].
*   **Firearm Regulations** The Sergeant, as a Federal Deputy, works to counteract restrictive decrees on gun ownership and carrying, which he sees as disarming law-abiding citizens. He notes that the current government is "clearly disarming" the population [02:51:27].

### Officer Safety and Operational Risks
Police work is inherently dangerous. Sergeant Fahur recounts direct experiences:
*   **Direct Confrontations** He describes a shootout with three armed men who abandoned their car after a pursuit, firing pistols at the police. The incident involved carbines, balaclavas, and a fake explosive vest, highlighting the extreme threats faced [02:04:26]. He recounts shooting from inside the vehicle through the windshield as a tactical maneuver he learned in training [02:08:19].
*   **Vehicle Pursuits** High-speed chases are common, often involving stolen or smuggled vehicles. An instance where a stolen SW4 collided with an F250 pickup truck during a pursuit demonstrates the unpredictability and danger of such operations [02:14:02].
*   **Concealed Weapons and Explosives** Criminals go to great lengths to hide weapons, sometimes even inside mattresses [02:17:28]. Fake explosives with timers are used to intimidate victims [02:06:30].
*   **Risk of Accidents** Working on highways involves significant risk of accidents, both to officers and the public [01:37:49]. He emphasizes the importance of immediate lane signaling and victim assistance [01:38:03]. He witnessed horrific accidents, including a 15-year-old girl burned to death in a car after a collision [01:38:52].
*   **Improvised Weapons** During an incident, a man wielding a pickaxe attacked Sergeant Fahur and his partner, necessitating a defensive posture with firearms [02:34:48].

### Psychological Impact and Personal Sacrifices
The constant exposure to crime, violence, and tragedy takes a toll on officers:
*   **Witnessing Human Evil** Sergeant Fahur describes incidents like the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl and the serial killings by the "Tower Maniac," which reinforce his view on the "human evil" that criminals represent [02:22:45]. These experiences lead him to believe that criminals pose a "high danger" to society and that their death is a "relief" [02:22:50].
*   **Personal Health** Sergeant Fahur suffered five heart attacks, three of which occurred while on duty in a police vehicle. One heart attack occurred after hearing of a friend's death in an accident, and another during a drug house raid [02:36:55]. These experiences highlight the physical and emotional stress of the job.
*   **Sleep Deprivation** Long shifts and the constant readiness required for police work lead to sleep deprivation and fatigue, as seen in his anecdote about trying to nap after an early morning shift [02:39:50].

## Political Stance and Advocacy
As a Federal Deputy, Sergeant Fahur actively advocates for:
*   **Increased Sentences** He supports legislative changes for stricter penalties, including the possibility of life imprisonment for heinous crimes, advocating for a plebiscite on the issue [02:27:53]. He also proposes a project to typify "serial killer" as a specific crime in Brazil [02:30:01].
*   **Mandatory Organ Donation from Criminals** He proposed a controversial project to compulsorily harvest organs from criminals killed in confrontations with police, without family authorization, to donate to transplant queues. He argues this would be a way for criminals to contribute to society after death [02:53:14].
*   **Equipping Police Forces** He is working to secure federal amendments to purchase 600 to 1,000 rifles for the Military Police of Paraná, arguing that every police vehicle, even in small towns, needs a rifle for initial confrontation with armed criminals [02:11:57]. He believes the "rifle is respected" by criminals due to its power [02:12:57].
*   **Valuing Public Security Operators** He advocates for better pay, decent working hours, and modern equipment for police and other public security professionals, believing that a valued operator offers more to society [02:49:06].
*   **Combating Criminal Factions** He actively works to destabilize criminal factions financially by blocking their accounts and seizing assets, in addition to confronting their members [03:34:51]. He highlights the serious threat posed by organized crime, citing plots to kill public figures [03:34:04].
*   **Increased Penalties for Cell Phone Theft** Recognizing the direct impact on ordinary citizens, he supports increasing penalties for cell phone theft and robbery [03:37:10].
*   **Against the Censorship Bill** He is vehemently against the proposed censorship bill (PL), viewing it as a "great lobby" by leftist groups, traditional media, and artists seeking to control information and profit from content, leading to suppression of free speech on platforms [02:59:00].
*   **Against Judicial Overreach** He criticizes the judiciary for overstepping its bounds into legislative matters, citing instances like the STF criminalizing homophobia without a specific law from Congress [03:06:13]. He also expresses frustration over being sued for his comments about criminals, even when those comments are truthful and widely known [03:08:36].

## Personal Philosophy
Sergeant Fahur maintains a strong personal conviction against crime and in favor of traditional policing methods. He believes in direct confrontation with criminals when necessary and holds a firm stance against what he perceives as overly lenient justice. His experiences have shaped a resilient character, unafraid to speak his mind, even if it leads to criticism or legal challenges [03:07:09]. He acknowledges that not everyone agrees with his views, but emphasizes that his opinions are rooted in a lifetime of direct experience on the front lines of law enforcement [03:08:00].

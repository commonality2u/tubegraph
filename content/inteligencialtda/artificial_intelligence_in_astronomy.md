[[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is being increasingly applied in the field of [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | astronomy]], particularly due to the massive amounts of data generated [00:09:23]. Roberta, a researcher, has been working with [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] in [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | astronomy]], focusing on black holes, for five to six years [00:09:27].

## The Data Deluge in Astronomy
[[Space Exploration and Astronomy | Astronomy]] is characterized by its immense data output, generating between 300 terabytes and pentabytes of data annually [00:23:03]. This volume doubles each year with the establishment of new telescopes and observatories [00:23:10]. Currently, there are not enough human researchers to process and analyze this data [00:23:22]. This massive, growing dataset makes [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | astronomy]] a field "made for" [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | artificial intelligence]], as it is an expensive area that relies heavily on data [00:23:57].

## Early Applications and Pattern Recognition
One early example of [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]]-like application in [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | astronomy]] was the SETI@home project (referred to as "Seven" in the transcript) [00:24:11]. This project utilized volunteers' computers to process vast amounts of radio telescope data, searching for patterns that might indicate non-random signals from the universe [00:24:58]. This process of searching for patterns in data is fundamentally a form of [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | artificial intelligence]] [00:25:31].

[[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] excels at identifying and removing noise from data, which is highly beneficial in analyzing audio signals from space [00:25:50]. This capability is akin to how [[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | algorithms]] learn to distinguish quality information from "garbage" online [02:26:09].

## Modern AI in Astronomical Research
Modern [[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | algorithms]] are applied to analyze image data, such as classifying spiral galaxies [00:38:12]. A notable recent advancement involved a Brazilian researcher who used basic [[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | algorithms]] to significantly improve the clarity of black hole images, rather than relying on complex neural networks [00:40:02]. This demonstrated that even simpler [[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | algorithms]] can provide effective solutions to complex problems in [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | astronomy]] [00:40:36].

Despite the clear benefits, there is some resistance to adopting [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] within the [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | astronomy]] community [01:35:42]. This reluctance often stems from a lack of understanding of how [[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | algorithms]] function, with some mistakenly perceiving them as "black boxes" that produce results without clear reasoning [01:36:01]. However, [[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | algorithms]] execute precise mathematical operations that can be explained [01:36:30].

The integration of [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] is seen as inevitable for the future of [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | astronomy]], especially with the upcoming generation of telescopes that will generate unprecedented data volumes [01:39:00]. These new observatories will necessitate AI for tasks like pre-processing data to decide what information to store, as storage capacity will be a major challenge [01:40:42].

## AI in Space Missions
[[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] also plays a crucial role in [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | space exploration]] and rocket launches [02:43:08]. For instance, Elon Musk's rockets land vertically due to [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] controlling their descent in real-time, adapting to changing conditions like wind [01:43:29]. The Perseverance rover's landing on Mars in 2021 relied on [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] to analyze high-resolution images of the terrain, compare them with pre-loaded maps, and select the safest landing spot [01:44:11]. Similarly, Chinese spacecraft use [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] to scan and compare terrain during moon landings [01:44:42]. Rocket launches are largely automated by onboard computers, with human action becoming minimal in the final minutes before liftoff [01:45:20].

## Future Outlook
The field of [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | artificial intelligence]] is in its "prehistory," continually advancing through improvements in computational capacity, the availability of big data, and the development of new [[Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning | algorithms]] [02:46:40]. These three factors are consistently growing, ensuring that [[Artificial Intelligence and its applications | AI]] will continue to expand and transform various areas, including [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | astronomy]] [02:46:57]. The evolution of AI, particularly in areas like data processing and pattern recognition, is seen as essential for future discoveries and advancements in [[Space Exploration and Astronomy | astronomy]] [01:39:20].

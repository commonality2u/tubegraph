Isabel Veloso, a 17-year-old facing a terminal cancer diagnosis, shares her profound perspective on [[life_challenges_and_wisdom | life]] and the paramount importance of living each moment to the fullest. Despite her daunting prognosis, Isabel chooses [[happiness_and_fulfillment | gratitude]] and a proactive approach to cherishing her remaining time, inspiring others to re-evaluate their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Embracing Life Amidst Diagnosis

Isabel was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma at 14, a cancer of the lymph nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Her initial symptoms included a large lump in her mediastinum, shortness of breath, and fluid in her lungs, which doctors initially dismissed as anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. The tumor grew to 17cm x 17cm x 17cm, compressing her heart, lungs, and trachea, and even shifting her heart to the right side of her chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

After years of treatments, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, the cancer returned and was deemed incurable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>. Isabel decided to stop aggressive treatments and enter palliative care, focusing on quality of life rather than a cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This decision, though difficult, was a turning point, allowing her to live her "best phase" despite facing her "worst phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Shifting Perspective to Gratitude
Isabel's journey is marked by an extraordinary shift in perspective. She asserts that the hardest part of cancer isn't the disease itself, but the exhausting treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. Despite the pain and discouragement, she never questioned God, choosing to be thankful for the time she has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>. This perspective inspired her book, "Despite the pain, gratitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.

She emphasizes the value of small details over grand gestures, believing that true [[happiness_and_fulfillment | fulfillment]] comes from appreciating fleeting moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. Isabel and her fiancé, Lucas, have committed to facing life together, making the most of every second, even discussing bucket list items like skydiving and traveling to the Maldives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.

## A Mission to "Cure" Others
Isabel believes her mission isn't to be cured herself, but to "cure" others by teaching them to value their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. She finds greater joy in knowing she has left this legacy than in the possibility of her own cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. This [[personal_growth_and_selfimprovement | personal transformation]] allows her to choose [[happiness_and_fulfillment | gratitude]] and smile, even when facing judgment for appearing "too happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

> [!quote] The essence of "cure"
> I understood that my mission here sometimes isn't to be cured. I know it's hard sometimes for people to hear that, but having the mission to cure. I think it's more beautiful than being cured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

## Navigating Social Media and Personal Challenges
Isabel has used social media, particularly TikTok, as a therapeutic outlet for sharing her journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>. While this transparency has garnered support, it has also led to public scrutiny and accusations of lying about her condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. Despite the pressure, she posted medical reports to quiet the doubters, affirming that she doesn't need to prove anything to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

Her childhood was marked by frequent moves and her parents' constant work, leading to early anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. She believes her anxiety may have even contributed to triggering her cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. However, her family's love provided a crucial foundation during her initial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>.

## Embracing the "Now" and Leaving a Mark
Isabel’s biggest fear is not death itself, but leaving behind the people she loves, particularly Lucas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. Her perspective on death has shifted from fear to acceptance, especially during moments of extreme pain where she simply longed for it to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.

Her greatest desire is to leave an unforgettable mark on her loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>. She asks them to "breathe for me, what I can't breathe. Live for me, what I couldn't live. And love what I couldn't love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>. This embodies her profound message: embrace every moment, cherish connections, and find [[happiness_and_fulfillment | joy]] in the smallest details, for time is precious and finite.

## Advice for Others
Isabel's message to others facing similar diagnoses or difficult situations is clear:
*   **Do not compare your case to others** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>. Every individual's response to illness and treatment is unique.
*   **Enjoy every moment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>. Even when it's hard, choose [[happiness_and_fulfillment | happiness]] to improve your quality of life.
*   **Don't rebel against God or life's circumstances** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>. Complaining will not bring healing.
*   **Love heals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. While it may not cure cancer, it can heal emotional wounds and improve quality of life.
*   **Hold onto something** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>. Whether it's a loved one, faith, or a simple hobby like cooking, find your source of strength and joy.

Isabel's journey highlights that while not everyone can be cured, everyone can choose how they live their lives, and in doing so, find a deeper [[happiness_and_fulfillment | fulfillment]] and leave a lasting impact on those around them.

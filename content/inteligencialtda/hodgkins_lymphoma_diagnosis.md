Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes, which are essential components of the immune system responsible for producing defense cells and draining the body [01:11:07]. In the context of a diagnosis, cancer is described as a cell that develops incorrectly and proliferates, leading to the formation of a tumor [01:10:51].

## Isabel's Diagnostic Journey

Isabel's journey to diagnosis was protracted and challenging, marked by multiple misdiagnoses and severe symptoms.

### Initial Symptoms and Medical Misinterpretations
Isabel's first noticeable symptom was a lump in her mediastinum [01:12:25], located in her chest. Her symptoms were largely related to the significant size of this tumor [01:13:33]. She experienced severe shortness of breath due to fluid accumulation in her lungs [01:11:52], with doctors eventually draining 9.5 liters of fluid [01:27:36]. This fluid production was directly linked to the tumor's size [01:12:03].

Before receiving a correct diagnosis, Isabel consulted five doctors, none of whom identified the issue accurately [01:26:49]. Some suggested her symptoms were merely "nervousness" or "gastritis" [01:26:55], with one even advising her to drink tea and that her problems were "all in [her] head" [01:27:19]. She vividly recalls a consultation where she was coughing so severely she almost vomited [01:27:30].

The severity of her condition became evident when her heart was found to be displaced to the right side of her chest due to the large tumor [01:28:40], which had compressed her heart, lungs, and trachea [01:30:22]. The tumor was a significant 17 cm by 17 cm by 17 cm, like a "ball" [01:46:15], causing visible protrusion in her chest [01:45:28].

### The Breakthrough and Confirmation
Isabel's diagnosis finally came after an X-ray, when the technician noted a lung problem and looked at her with a "terrified face" [01:29:03]. This moment confirmed her own intuition, as she had a premonition during prayer 15 days prior that she had cancer [01:29:29].

The biopsy results were initially perplexing, showing sarcoma cells despite all symptoms pointing to lymphoma, and her specific lymphoma subtype was "unclassifiable classical Hodgkin's lymphoma" [01:33:03]. Eventually, it was concluded to be Hodgkin's lymphoma [01:33:14].

## Life After Diagnosis
Isabel has been undergoing [[cancer_treatment_and_palliative_care | cancer treatment]] for three years [00:07:38]. This year, she found out she is a [[cancer_treatment_and_palliative_care | palliative care]] patient, meaning she does not have much time left to live [00:07:43]. The decision to enter [[cancer_treatment_and_palliative_care | palliative care]] came after a severe reaction to immunotherapy, which caused neuropathic pain and a significant reduction in her quality of life, leaving her unable to walk without a wheelchair [01:00:06]. Doctors could not guarantee her prognosis, estimating it to be a matter of months [01:02:50], but emphasized that each case is unique [00:56:20].

The diagnosis and the decision to stop active treatment were a shock for her family [01:22:27]. However, Isabel's [[personal_and_family_impact_of_cancer | family's love]] and support have been her foundation, helping her cope with the immense physical and emotional pain [01:23:29]. She has chosen to embrace gratitude despite the pain, focusing on living each moment to the fullest and curing others through her story rather than pursuing her own cure [01:08:01].

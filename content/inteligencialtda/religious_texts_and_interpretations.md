Religious texts and their interpretations have profoundly shaped human history and belief systems. Throughout millennia, various traditions have emerged, each with unique narratives concerning creation, divinity, morality, and eschatology.

## Evolution of Biblical Texts and Christian Dogma

### Early Christian Manuscripts and Canonical Selection
In the 4th century, approximately 4,000 Gospels of Christianity were available [00:06:18]. When Christianity transitioned from a persecuted religion to the state religion of the Roman Empire under Emperor Constantine, these texts underwent a sifting process [00:06:26]. Constantine's decision was influenced by his mother, Helena, who advised him to embrace Christianity and cease its persecution [00:06:40].

Jerome, a polemicist from Alexandria, was hired by Damasus, the first Pope of the Catholic Church, to separate canonical texts from thousands of manuscripts written in Aramaic and Greek for Latin translation [00:06:48]. This process determined which Gospels would be officially accepted by the Catholic Church and which would be deemed [[Gnostic Texts and Their Influence on Christian Tradition | heretical]] or "apocryphal" [00:07:14].

### The Missing Years of Jesus
The Bible contains no mention of Jesus's life between the ages of 14 and 20 [00:05:37]. Spiritual revelations suggest that during this period, Jesus traveled to places like India, Persia, and Egypt, financed by Joseph of Arimathea [00:14:43], who was a wealthy Jewish and Roman citizen [00:12:07]. This information is viewed with caution and cannot be stamped as definitively true [00:06:01].

The Bible recounts an event when Jesus, at approximately 9-11 years old, was left behind in Jerusalem by Mary and Joseph [00:08:35]. After three days, they found him in the Sanhedrin, listening to and questioning the doctors of the law [00:09:25]. Jesus's response to Mary's admonition indicated his awareness of his divine purpose: "You do not know that I came into this world to take care of my father's interests?" [00:09:37].

### Interpretations of Jesus's Figure
The speaker identifies three "faces" of Jesus that emerged after his death:
1.  **Jesus the Galilean**: Created by the 11 apostles (excluding Judas Iscariot, who was from Judea) who believed Jesus's message was exclusively for Jews [00:19:21]. The apostles were mostly illiterate Galileans [00:22:05].
2.  **Jesus the Christ (Marvel Superstar)**: Developed by Paul (Saul of Tarsus), who encountered the resurrected Jesus and began spreading Christianity to the wider world [00:20:11]. Paul introduced concepts of [[interpretation_of_biblical_texts_on_salvation | salvation]] and [[soteriology_and_theological_interpretations | justification by faith]], which Jesus himself never explicitly taught, as Jesus stated that reward would be "given to each one according to his works" [00:21:25]. The term "Christ" (meaning "the anointed one") was only used after Jesus's death by Paul [00:20:41].
3.  **Jesus the Living One**: Promoted by Mary Magdalene and a group of Hellenic (Greek-speaking) Jewish disciples, who received new revelations from the resurrected Jesus [00:22:26]. These teachings were compiled into dozens of manuscripts, which the Catholic Church later suppressed or deleted in the 4th century [00:22:34].

### The Da Vinci Code and Apocryphal Narratives
The theory explored in "The Da Vinci Code," suggesting Jesus had a carnal relationship with Mary Magdalene and had children whose lineage led to the Merovingians in France, is described as brilliant fiction [00:23:11]. Spiritual gossip, however, suggests Jesus fell in love with Martha, Lazarus's sister, but did not express it to avoid harming his mission or her, knowing his eventual fate [00:18:03].

### Gnostic Gospels and the Demiurge
Mary Magdalene's teachings, found in texts now called Gnostic Gospels, contained "strange things" [00:23:47]. One shocking revelation from the resurrected Jesus was regarding the "Biblical God" (Yahweh). He referred to him as the "demiurge," a term coined by Plato two centuries earlier [00:24:50]. This concept marked the emergence of Gnosticism, which emphasized "true knowledge" (gnosis) [00:25:07]. However, Gnostics later erred by calling the God of Israel "the devil," a concept Jesus never endorsed [00:25:35].

### Suppression and Rediscovery of Texts
In 376 AD, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria decreed the destruction of all Gnostic books [00:28:36]. Monks of the Monastery of Saint Pachomius in Egypt translated these texts from Greek to Coptic and later hid them in caves to escape burning by the Roman Empire [00:28:54]. These texts, which included writings by Mary Magdalene, were rediscovered in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 [02:52:16], two years before the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in 1947 [02:52:16].

Another book, the Book of Enoch, considered more important than other texts at the time, was removed from the Septuagint (a Greek version of the Old Testament with 47 books) by Jerome in the 4th century, reducing it to 46 books [02:52:16]. The Book of Enoch announced that Yahweh would send his Messiah, making Jesus a character prophesied by Enoch [02:52:16]. This removal was part of a larger effort to dispel Jewish myths as Christianity became the state religion [02:52:16].

### The Holy Trinity and Its Purpose
The Council of Nicaea, convened by Constantine in 325 AD, transformed Christianity into Catholicism [03:17:10]. It was here that the myth of the Holy Trinity was created to obscure the human side of Jesus and distance the Catholic Church from the God of the Jews [03:17:10]. The concept asserts Jesus was equal to God and introduced the Holy Spirit, which Jesus never spoke of as himself [03:17:10]. The speaker suggests that the Holy Trinity is an invention of Catholicism, making it difficult for even philosophers like Hegel to justify its "consubstantiality" logically [03:17:10].

## The Problem of Evil and Mythological Perspectives

### Theological Justifications for Suffering
Theological explanations for human suffering, such as the idea that God sacrificed his "only son as a Lamb" to pay for humanity's sins, are deemed illogical [03:17:10]. The speaker argues that no rational parent would sacrifice their child, and an omnipotent God would not need blood to atone for sin [03:17:10]. This perspective is described as dishonest and contrary to human logic, as Catholicism prioritizes the Church's interpretation over the literal word of God [03:17:10].

### Mythologies and the Fallen Creator
Mythologies, originating from rational human thought dating back 47,000 years, offer alternative explanations for the origin of evil [03:17:10]. Over the last 20,000 years, oral traditions codified news and stories through verse and rhyme for reliable transmission [03:17:10]. The speaker states that over 100 studied mythologies, including Chinese and Hindu, describe a "cosmic egg" or "singularity" from which reality emerged, and all point to a "fallen creator" or a mistake in creation [03:17:10].

> "Mythologies say that there is a long time what is the problem the creator fell or what does this fall mean? literally a fall indeed literally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>

This "fall" or mistake in creation resulted in the creator being "reconstructed with rotten parts" of itself, leading to inherent imperfection and what humans perceive as evil [03:17:10]. Thus, "evil comes from the creator himself" [03:17:10]. Religions, emerging in the last 4,000 years, "canceled all this," manipulating these tales and inventing new myths, like the perfect God who doesn't make mistakes [03:17:10].

### Original Sin and Baptism
The concept of original sin, attributed to Eve's "eating" of the fruit of wisdom (which the speaker interprets as drinking a "potion" or "hallucination" [03:17:10]), is seen as a mental disorder invented by religion [03:17:10]. This myth justifies the need for infant baptism, where a baby is "born in sin" and must renounce the "demon" [03:17:10]. This practice is considered "indecent to the human condition" [03:17:10].

### The Myth of Lucifer and the Devil
The figures of Lucifer, Satan, and the devil are largely inventions, though certain beings do exist but not in those terms [03:17:10]. The concept of a personified evil figure gained prominence with the Templars in the 11th-13th centuries [03:17:10]. The Vatican, seeking to maintain power, conspired with Philip IV of France to destroy the Templars, accusing them of worshipping the devil (Baphomet) [03:17:10]. This led to Baphomet being depicted with horns, cementing the devil's image in Catholic belief [03:17:10].

## Angels, Demons, and Other Beings
The speaker defines angels as "robotic beings," or "Clones," created by Yahweh, who obey without individual will [03:17:10]. Demons (daivas in Sanskrit) originated when a "Clone" spirit attacked Yahweh and was destroyed, but its spirit became a new type of being that could metamorphose [03:17:10].

The terms "angel" and "God" have been misused by humanity [03:17:10]. Early cultures recognized good and bad gods, and good and bad angels, but Judaism, and later Catholicism, simplified this into "good angel and bad demon," obscuring nuanced characteristics of these beings [03:17:10].

The Bible's mention of "Nefel" in Genesis (translated as "giants" in Portuguese) refers to Sumerian "aliens" (Anunnaki) who arrived on Earth 450,000 years ago [03:17:10]. These beings, including clans of Enlil and Enki, later mixed their genetics with humans, creating "demigods" or "giants" [03:17:10]. The flood was an attempt to eradicate this race [03:17:10]. Yahweh ordered Moses to exterminate these "giants" and their descendants to prevent further mixing of DNA [03:17:10].

Gilgamesh, a demigod in Mesopotamian mythology, sought to find a hidden launch base of the Anunnaki in what is now Lebanon, desiring to ascend to where the gods resided [03:17:10].

## Prophecy, Suffering, and the Human Condition
The speaker expresses a belief that there is no "good news" for humanity regarding the end times, as accumulated problems in all areas of life will lead to "shocks of Reality" [03:17:10]. This stems from humans transferring their responsibilities to a personal God [03:17:10].

### Disillusionment with Traditional Faith
The speaker finds the common use of faith, where people thank God for personal successes while others suffer, to be "unworthy" and a "lack of respect for God" [03:17:10].

> "If I'm on a plane, the plane crashes, I escape, I say thanks to God... this and screwed that is unworthy whoever is on the other side doing it that if someone did it it is not a God because neither would I do that Neither would you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:10">[03:17:10]</a>

He views traditional prayers as selfish and self-serving [03:17:10]. Instead, he advocates for aligning with oneself and resting in "the good and the decency that exists in me and in my fellow men" [03:17:10].

### The Human Condition and Responsibility
Humanity is described as "corrupt monstrosities" but also capable of great acts of self-sacrifice and mutual care [03:17:10]. The speaker asserts that "God will never solve it" because humans are responsible for their own suffering [03:17:10]. The current era is dystopian due to accumulated negative outcomes, such as economic failure, environmental problems, and state terrorism [03:17:10].

The influence of viruses, like Toxoplasma gondii, which manipulates host behavior (e.g., mice drawn to cat urine) [03:17:10], and COVID-19, which affects the human brain and personality [03:17:10], is presented as another factor contributing to human "imbecilization" [03:17:10]. This may be part of a larger plan by "beings from this neighboring universe" to "dehumanize the human being" and potentially reclaim Earth, as their own universe is ending [03:17:10].

### The Concept of Self and Reincarnation
The human "self" is not the body or soul but an "epiphenomenal process" of the connectome, a complex network of neurons and synapses in the brain [03:17:10]. When the body dies, this self continues to exist uninterruptedly in a spiritual body [03:17:10]. The Tibetan Book of the Dead's technique of "Poa" (art of dying well) suggests that one's last thought influences their transition [03:17:10]. The speaker maintains his personal mantras to die with dignity rather than pray for salvation [03:17:10].

Reincarnation is explained through the concept of "three little ghosts" or lower quaternary bodies (etheric, astral, mental) that absorb emotional, sentimental, and conceptual files from the physical body [03:17:10]. If these bodies carry negative files at death, they cling to the Immortal Triad (atmic, buddhic, manna bodies, or soul/spirit) [03:17:10]. To resolve these "dirty codes," the spirit must produce new bodies (reincarnate) [03:17:10]. This process is driven by necessity, not love, to clear accumulated "karma" from past lives [03:17:10].

## Ancient Wisdom and Extraterrestrial Influence
Ancient structures like the pyramids of Giza and Angkor Wat, and the Nazca lines, are presented as evidence of extraterrestrial influence [03:17:10]. Robert Bauval's "Orion Correlation Theory" notes the precise alignment of the Giza pyramids with the stars of Orion's Belt, a correlation that matches astronomical positions from approximately 12,450 years ago [03:17:10]. Similarly, Angkor Wat's temples align with the Draco constellation from the same period [03:17:10].

This suggests that "megalithic constructions" across Earth were built to represent the sky at specific ancient times [03:17:10]. The "Legend of the Seven Sages Builders" describes how people, possibly descendants of advanced civilizations from a supercontinent called Hyperborea, spread across Earth after a cataclysm and built these structures as warnings for future generations [03:17:10].

The Dogon people of Africa possess knowledge of Sirius B and C, which were only discovered by modern telescopes in the 1990s, and claim their ancestors came from a planet orbiting Sirius C [03:17:10]. They also correlate the mass and volume ratios of the Giza pyramids with the Sirius stars [03:17:10]. This suggests that "beings that have ever existed here on earth" and "were not human" played a role in human creation [03:17:10]. Paul Hellyer, former Canadian Minister of Defense, explicitly stated that aliens exist and he knows of four species [03:17:10].

The speaker emphasizes that humans must use their rationality and embrace uncertainty rather than clinging to certainties provided by belief systems, as this hinders true understanding and progress [03:17:10].

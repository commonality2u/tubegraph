## Background: The Book and its Context

Ulisses Campbell is writing a book about the [[overview_of_suzane_von_richthofen_case | Suzane von Richthofen case]], which is part of a trilogy. The third book in this series, "Fleur de Lis: The Shepherdess of the Devil," is set to be released on December 5th and is already on pre-sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:07">[03:03:07]</a>. This book was originally planned for an August release but was delayed due to the postponement of Flordelis's trial, which was initially in May, then July, and then December 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:38">[03:51:38]</a>. The legal strategy of delaying the trial caused the author to rewrite parts of the book, shifting the approach to include more background information on her family and children, some of whom already have convictions for crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## Nature of the Crime

The case of Flordelis involves religion, sex, and power, which makes it a highly complex and sensitive subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>. Flordelis, a former deputy and pastor, allegedly used her position of power within her church and political office to orchestrate her husband's murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:01">[03:53:01]</a>.

## The Criminal Enterprise

Flordelis is accused of setting up a criminal organization comprised of her own biological and adopted children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a>.
Initially, the plot involved poisoning her husband, Anderson, by putting arsenic or lead in his food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:27">[03:47:27]</a>. These attempts led to his hospitalization twice, but the small doses used did not result in death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:15">[03:48:15]</a>. When poisoning failed, they attempted to hire a professional hitman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:49">[03:49:49]</a>. Ultimately, her biological son, Flávio, shot and killed the stepfather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:01">[03:53:01]</a>.

## Family Dynamics and Sexual Crimes

The case reveals highly disturbing family dynamics. Flordelis's husband, Anderson, is portrayed as the initial architect of the "Flordelismo" enterprise, seeking to build it into a successful venture, leading to Flordelis's rise as a singer, pastor, and deputy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:52">[03:43:52]</a>.
The case also includes accusations of sexual crimes. Flordelis is accused of sexual relations with her adopted children and of allowing her husband to have sex with some of their daughters, which she termed a "purification ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:06">[03:36:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Her uncle, who had a Candomblé yard, reportedly mixed Candomblé rituals with satanic practices, including animal sacrifice, and even held evangelical services in the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:18">[03:38:18]</a>. This background is explored to understand the complexities of Flordelis's origins and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:12">[03:40:12]</a>.

## Legal Strategies and Trial Delay

A key aspect of the [[legal_nuances_in_high_profile_crime_convictions | legal nuances]] in the Flordelis case is the strategy of trial postponement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This was done to delay the judgment, potentially allowing for strategic maneuvers like a sick daughter, Simone, with advanced cancer, confessing to the crime to protect Flordelis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:34">[02:50:34]</a>. The defense aims to have Simone judged before she dies, hoping her confession would reduce Flordelis's culpability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>.

## Public Perception and Media Influence

The case has generated significant public and media attention, similar to other [[highprofile_crime_cases_in_brazil | high-profile crime cases in Brazil]] such as the [[overview_of_suzane_von_richthofen_case | Suzane von Richthofen case]] and the Nardoni couple's trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The judge, in such cases, might feel less comfortable giving a severe sentence due to the pressure from society and the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
The author notes that people are "fascinated" by [[true_crime_case_studies | true crime case studies]], especially those based on real facts, often showing more interest in podcasts or short clips than in reading entire books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:09">[03:20:09]</a>. This public fascination contributes to the continuous discussion and analysis of such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:09">[03:21:09]</a>.

## Comparisons to Other Cases

Ulisses Campbell's book on Flordelis is the third in a trilogy, following books on [[overview_of_suzane_von_richthofen_case | Suzane von Richthofen]] and [[details_of_the_elise_matsunaga_case | Elise Matsunaga]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:38">[02:37:38]</a>. The author observed the public's reaction to [[details_of_the_elise_matsunaga_case | Elise Matsunaga]]'s release from prison, where women clapped for her, in contrast to the revulsion shown towards Isabella Nardoni's stepmother, Ana Carolina Jatobá <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:56">[02:25:56]</a>. This phenomenon highlights how [[criminal_psychology_and_its_impact | criminal psychology]] and public perception differ across [[notable_crime_cases_and_investigations | notable crime cases]]. The public's desire to understand the motivations behind such crimes is a recurring theme in the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>.

> [!info] Note
> The transcript extensively covers the [[details_of_the_elise_matsunaga_case | Elise Matsunaga case]] and the [[overview_of_suzane_von_richthofen_case | Suzane von Richthofen case]] as comparisons to Flordelis, but focuses more on the investigation methods and public reception of the former two. Details on Flordelis's own investigation process are less direct and more related to the general "criminal enterprise" and "legal strategies" aspects mentioned.

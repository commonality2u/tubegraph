## Isabel Veloso's Journey
Isabel Veloso, at 17 years old, has been undergoing [[Living with Cancer | cancer treatment]] for three years, having been diagnosed with [[Hodgkins Lymphoma Diagnosis | Hodgkin's lymphoma]] at age 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:22">[07:38:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:14">[10:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:37">[10:37:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:14">[16:04:14]</a>. Early in her life, Isabel experienced frequent relocation due to her parents' work, leading to difficulties with friendships and a constant sense of anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:26">[13:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:07">[13:33:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:17">[13:46:17]</a>. She was diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder, and one doctor suggested that her anxiety might have triggered her cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:15">[14:19:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:13">[14:28:13]</a>. She faced challenges in school due to nervousness and had trouble sleeping, requiring medication and antipsychotics from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>.

Her [[Hodgkins Lymphoma Diagnosis | diagnosis]] came after multiple misdiagnoses from doctors who attributed her symptoms to nervousness or gastritis, despite severe shortness of breath and fluid in her lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:19">[26:48:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:24">[27:22:24]</a>. At one point, 9.5 liters of fluid were drained from her lung, and her heart was displaced due to the large tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:21">[31:17:21]</a>. Doctors in Cascavel informed her that if she had waited one more day, her lung could have burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:04">[28:14:04]</a>.

In the past year, Isabel met her fiancé, Lucas, at the gym, and they quickly decided they wanted to get married and build a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:30">[11:16:30]</a>. After her recent diagnosis of incurable cancer and being in palliative care, they decided to accelerate their wedding plans, which gained significant public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:15">[07:49:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:30">[11:16:30]</a>.

### Hodgkin's Lymphoma Diagnosis
Doctor Melina explained that [[Hodgkins Lymphoma Diagnosis | Hodgkin's lymphoma]] is a [[Living with Cancer | cancer]] of the lymph nodes, which are glands throughout the body that produce defense cells and are involved in body drainage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. In Isabel's case, the first sign was a lump in the mediastinum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. Her symptoms, including shortness of breath and fluid in her lungs, were directly related to the large size of the tumor, which was 17cm x 17cm x 17cm and was compressing her heart, lungs, and trachea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:30">[28:28:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>. Isabel also mentioned that her lymphoma's subtype was "unclassifiable classical Hodgkin's lymphoma" in her biopsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:00">[33:03:00]</a>.

## Treatment Modalities

### Chemotherapy
Isabel underwent chemotherapy, which she described as destroying both good and bad cells in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:00">[37:04:00]</a>. One three-day chemotherapy session was particularly brutal, causing continuous vomiting and extreme weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.

### Immunotherapy
After chemotherapy, Isabel began immunotherapy, which works by helping the body's immune system fight diseased cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:53:00">[36:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>. This was the first therapy that proved effective, nearly clearing her disease after five applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:24:00">[37:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>. Immunotherapy typically does not cause hair loss as it targets diseased cells more specifically than chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:11">[01:29:11]</a>.

### Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant
Following successful immunotherapy, Isabel underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant, meaning she was her own donor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:25:00">[38:25:00]</a>. This procedure is done by collecting peripheral vein blood, freezing it, and then reinfusing it after six days of chemotherapy to kill existing marrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a>. The autologous method has fewer side effects because the body is already familiar with its own cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:00">[38:56:00]</a>.## Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care

The autologous method has fewer side effects because the body is already familiar with its own cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:00">[38:56:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Side Effects of Transplant
> During the transplant, Isabel experienced a strong corn taste and smell due to preservatives, and short breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:00]</a>. Post-transplant, she was hospitalized for 21 days and suffered mucositis, a severe inflammation of the digestive system from her neck to her stomach, requiring three days on morphine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:42:00">[41:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:57:00">[41:57:00]</a>. Her immunity dropped to almost zero, necessitating blood transfusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:09:00">[43:09:00]</a>. She also had to receive all childhood vaccines again as her immune system reset to that of a newborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:32:00">[44:32:00]</a>.

### Experimental Treatments
Isabel mentioned that a treatment called Cart Cell, which involves modifying T cells, is not suitable for her type of lymphoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. She also learned about a medicine called Nivolumab, which could stabilize the tumor's growth but would likely cause severe side effects like pneumonia or intestinal infection, without offering a cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:18">[01:25:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>.

## Palliative Care
After experiencing a severe reaction to her last immunotherapy application, which caused extreme neuropathic pain and temporary loss of movement in her legs, Isabel decided against further aggressive treatment and entered palliative care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Definition of Palliative Care
> Doctor Melina explained that "palliative" comes from the Greek word "palium," meaning "mantle," symbolizing a holistic approach to patient care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:04">[01:54:04]</a>. Palliative care focuses on treating the patient as a whole, controlling physical, emotional, spiritual, and social pain, and supporting the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:09">[01:54:09]</a>. It aims to improve the patient's quality of life regardless of the time they have left, rather than curing the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:39">[01:56:39]</a>.

Isabel opted for [[Living with Cancer | palliative care]] to prioritize her quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:59">[01:55:59]</a>. She is currently using a strong pain relief patch and cannabidiol, which help manage her pain and anxiety, leading to a much better mental state than during her treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. She feels she is living her "best phase" in palliative care due to reduced suffering and pain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.

## Living with the Diagnosis
Isabel's [[Personal and Family Impact of Cancer | personal and family impact of cancer]] journey has profoundly changed her perspective on life. She now values small details and seeks to enjoy every moment, realizing she lived on autopilot before her diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>. She focuses on living in the present, cherishing interactions with loved ones, and is writing a book titled "Despite the Pain, Gratitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

While accepting her likely short lifespan, Isabel aims to "cure" others by inspiring them to appreciate their time, rather than seeking a cure for herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. She expresses gratitude for her journey, believing it made her who she is and taught her to value breathing and everyday moments that she once took for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.

> [!TIP] Message to Others
> Isabel's message to others facing similar diagnoses is not to compare their cases, as each organism responds differently to treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>. She advises embracing happiness and knowing that love heals, even if it doesn't cure the physical illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>. She also encourages holding onto a reason for strength, whether it's loved ones, spirituality, or a hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:19">[01:34:19]</a>.

Isabel shares her story on social media, using it as a form of therapy to process her experiences and connect with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. Despite the criticism and pressure from some who doubt her condition, she chooses to share her reality to break taboos surrounding terminal illness and palliative care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:27">[01:35:27]</a>. Her journey exemplifies [[Overcoming challenges and resilience | overcoming challenges and resilience]] and finding purpose in the face of adversity.

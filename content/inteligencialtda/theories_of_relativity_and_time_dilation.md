The concept of time has intrigued humanity throughout history. Early civilizations defined time based on observed cycles like day and night, or the phases of the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This human-centric definition helped establish routines for daily life, including agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:01">[02:20:01]</a>. However, from a physical perspective, time remains an unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

## Time as a Human Concept
Ancient methods of tracking time relied on astronomical observations. Early humans marked the moon's passage, recognizing its changing phases as a clearer indicator than the sun's consistent appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. Evidence of this includes a 30,000-year-old monkey bone marked with lunar phases, found at the Natural History Museum in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. Constellations were also vital, used by Egyptians to predict planting and harvesting seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

The modern definition of a second is based on the decay time of the Cesium-133 atom, specifically 9 billion vibrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, although it is now being updated to the time light takes to travel a certain distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. The division of a day into 24 hours and minutes into 60 stems from the use of sundials, where circles were divided into equal intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

## Time in Physics
### Minkowski and Space-Time
The idea of a [[cosmological_theories_and_the_concept_of_cosmic_void | four-dimensional universe]], where time is the fourth dimension, was introduced by Hermann Minkowski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. This concept describes our reality as "space-time," a single entity where we move in three spatial dimensions and one unique temporal direction: forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:08">[03:03:08]</a>. We are constantly [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | traveling through time]] at a rate of one second per second towards the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Entropy and the Arrow of Time
Within physics, especially thermodynamics, time is defined by entropy, which refers to the measure of disorder in a system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy always increases in an isolated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>. This increase in disorder defines the "arrow of time," meaning that most physical processes in the universe are irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. For example, a broken glass cannot spontaneously reassemble, nor can a cooked omelet return to its raw egg form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>. This principle is a major barrier to [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | time travel to the past]] in our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>.

### Theories of Relativity
Albert Einstein's theories of relativity fundamentally changed the understanding of time.

#### Special Relativity and Speed-Based Time Dilation
Special Relativity posits that time is not homogeneous; it passes differently depending on the observer's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. As an object approaches the [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | speed of light]], time passes slower for that object relative to a stationary observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>. This phenomenon, known as time dilation, has been experimentally confirmed in particle accelerators like the LHC, where accelerated particles exhibit longer decay times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.

This concept is crucial for [[interstellar_travel_and_reference_frames | interstellar travel and reference frames]]. For instance, if a spaceship were to travel at 90% the speed of light to Alpha Centauri (4.2 light-years away), the journey would take 4.2 years for observers on Earth. However, for the astronauts inside the ship, only about two months would pass, due to time dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. This highlights the relativistic nature of time, where its passage depends on the observer's frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

#### General Relativity and Gravity-Based Time Dilation
General Relativity extends this idea, stating that gravity also influences the passage of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. The stronger the gravitational field, the slower time passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>. This effect is subtle but critical; for example, GPS satellites must account for both speed and gravitational time dilation to provide accurate positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

The film *Interstellar* famously illustrates this concept. On Miller's Planet, which orbits very close to a supermassive [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_time | black hole]], time passes much slower than on the distant mothership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>. Two hours on Miller's Planet equated to 27 years on the mothership, effectively allowing the characters to "[[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | travel to the future]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:11">[01:32:11]</a>.

### Newtonian Physics vs. Relativity
Newtonian physics, while sufficient for everyday terrestrial phenomena, does not account for the extreme conditions of high speeds or strong gravitational fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. Relativity, however, encompasses Newtonian mechanics; at low speeds and weak gravitational fields, Einstein's equations simplify to Newton's laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

### Black Holes and Time
[[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_time | Black holes]] are extreme examples of space-time distortion. Their immense gravity causes time to slow down significantly nearby, and theoretically, stop at the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. An observer falling into a black hole would experience time normally, but a distant observer would see their time passage slow to a halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a>.

### Wormholes and Theoretical Travel
[[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_time | Wormholes]] are theoretical passages through space-time that could connect distant points, potentially allowing for faster-than-light travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:21">[02:09:21]</a>. While predicted by general relativity, they have not been observed and would likely require "exotic matter" with negative mass or energy density to remain stable and traversable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:55">[02:09:55]</a>. Wormholes could shorten paths through space, but current understanding suggests they would not allow travel to past points in one's own timeline, preserving the second law of thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:11">[02:14:11]</a>.

### Quantum Entanglement and Non-Causality
Quantum physics introduces phenomena like quantum entanglement, where two particles become linked regardless of distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. An observation of one particle instantly affects the other, even if separated by thousands of light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. This "non-causal" behavior, where information appears to travel faster than light, troubled Einstein but has been experimentally proven, earning a Nobel Prize in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. This area suggests limitations of relativity at quantum scales, indicating that the laws of physics operate differently in the "Ant-Man universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

### Theoretical Predictions vs. Experimental Proof
In physics, there is a distinction between theoretical predictions and experimental verification. [[black_holes_and_theoretical_physics | Black holes]], for example, were first predicted by mathematical calculations from Einstein's equations before being observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:7:12">[02:7:12]</a>. Many [[scientific_and_philosophical_theories_about_alien_life | theories]], like those involving tachyons (hypothetical particles faster than light) or wormholes, exist on paper but lack experimental proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. A scientific theory must be refutable; otherwise, it becomes dogma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:26">[03:09:26]</a>.

## Paradoxes of Time Travel
### Grandfather Paradox
The grandfather paradox asks: if one travels to the past and kills their own grandfather before their parents are born, how can they exist in the future to make the trip? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:23">[01:47:23]</a> This paradox serves as an argument against the possibility of past [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | time travel]].

### Bootstrap Paradox
The Bootstrap Paradox, also known as the ontological paradox, describes a situation where an item or information is sent back in time, and then becomes its own origin. For example, if someone travels to the past to give Guimar√£es Rosa his own published book, who truly wrote the book? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> This paradox suggests that if something lacks an original source, time travel to the past may be impossible or must adhere to a principle of self-consistency, where events unfold exactly as they already did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>.

### Twin Paradox
The twin paradox, while often presented as a paradox, is not considered one by physicists because it is explained by special relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:56">[01:55:56]</a>. If one twin travels at near-light speed while the other remains on Earth, the traveling twin will age slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:20">[01:54:20]</a>. The apparent paradox arises from the symmetry of relative motion, but it is resolved by recognizing that the accelerated twin changes inertial frames, while the Earth-bound twin does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:02">[01:58:02]</a>. This effect has been observed with astronauts like Scott Kelly, who aged slightly less than his twin brother Mark after spending 340 days on the International Space Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>.

## Alternative Cosmological Theories
### Block Universe
The Block Universe theory, a philosophical concept popularized by films like *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, proposes that all moments in time (past, present, and future) exist simultaneously as a fixed, unchanging block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. In this view, our consciousness simply moves through this block, giving the illusion of time passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>. While allowing for theoretical [[the_pursuit_of_understanding_time_in_physics | time travel]], it doesn't align with the causal nature of physics.

### G√∂del Universe
The G√∂del Universe is a theoretical solution to Einstein's equations that describes a rotating universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>. In this model, time is cyclical, meaning it would be possible to travel back to the same point in space-time by following a specific path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. This theory, however, has several conceptual problems regarding causality and entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:33">[02:43:33]</a>.

### Multiverse Theory
The multiverse theory suggests the existence of multiple parallel universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>. This idea arises from quantum fluctuations at the beginning of the universe, leading to "bubble universes" that may even collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:57">[01:27:57]</a>. While theoretically possible, there is currently no direct observational evidence to support its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:37">[01:28:37]</a>.

### The Fate of the Universe
[[cosmological_theories_and_the_concept_of_cosmic_void | Cosmological theories]] propose several ultimate fates for the universe:
*   **Big Freeze (Heat Death)**: The universe expands indefinitely until it freezes and all energy is evenly distributed, leading to a state of maximum entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:16">[02:58:16]</a>.
*   **Big Rip**: The universe expands so rapidly that all structures, from galaxies to atoms, are torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:24">[02:58:24]</a>.
*   **Big Crunch**: The expansion of the universe eventually reverses due to gravity, causing it to contract back into a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:40">[02:58:40]</a>.
*   **Big Bounce**: A cyclical model where the universe repeatedly expands from and contracts back into a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:45">[02:58:45]</a>.
These fates depend on factors like dark energy and the overall topology of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:56">[02:58:56]</a>.

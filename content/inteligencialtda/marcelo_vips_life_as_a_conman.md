Marcelo, also known by his nickname "Ferrari" (after the documentary), has lived a life full of adventures and elaborate deceptions, earning him a reputation as a notorious conman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. He has since transitioned to a new path, working as a consultant to combat fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

## Early Life and Childhood Ambitions

Born in Maringá, Paraná, Marcelo grew up and was raised in Curitiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. His childhood dream was to become a pilot, influenced by movies like Top Gun and his proximity to an aeroclub where his mother worked at the Ministry of Aeronautics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. He would often fly with instructors, gaining early knowledge of aviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. His father was a Federal Public Servant for the INSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

[[marcelos_attempts_to_change_his_life_and_work_in_fraud_prevention | Marcelo's life of adventures]] began around the age of 16 or 17, after his father passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Initial Scams and Impersonations

Marcelo's early deceptions included:
*   **Bus Company Scams:** He traveled throughout Brazil for free by claiming his nephew owned a bus company, staying in company accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. He leveraged the lack of technology at the time to make this believable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Non-existent Motorcycle Sales:** At 18 or 19, after leaving the army, he "sold all the motorcycles on foot" through an internal auction, collecting money in advance and then fleeing to Porto Seguro, leaving the buyers without their motorcycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. He preferred spending the money quickly rather than saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Fake Identities and Document Forgery:** His first arrest was in Balneário Camboriú for ideological falsehood, related to document forgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. He learned to create fake IDs using colored photocopies and specialized tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. He claimed to have 16 recognized fake identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>.
*   **Impersonating Musicians:** To gain access to parties, he claimed to be the drummer for the band Nenhum de Nós at a beach in Santa Catarina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
*   **Selling Non-existent Penthouses:** He impersonated a guitarist from Engenheiros do Hawaii in Balneário Camboriú to get free accommodation from the Secretary of Culture and Tourism. He then "bought" a penthouse that was for sale and proceeded to sell it to three different people, collecting their down payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

### The "Son of Gol" Impersonation

One of his most famous scams involved impersonating Henrique Constantino, the son of the owner of Gol Airlines, at a high-profile "Recifolia" party in Recife around 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.
*   **Infiltration:** He learned that Gol Boeings were bringing VIP guests to the party, which had an exclusive VIP area not for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. He called the production team, identifying himself as "Juliano," an advisor to the CEO of Gol, requesting VIP access for "Henrique Constantino" and two security guards at a 5-star hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
*   **Media Attention:** His presence attracted the attention of Amaury Júnior, a celebrity interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. Marcelo claimed to be the president of Gol, leading to a public interview where he was portrayed as the heir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Influence:** He offered a businessman access to "his" helicopter and even arranged for a model to fly from Recife to São Paulo on a Gol flight by calling the airport and claiming to be Henrique Constantino, using a jump seat for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   **Arrest:** The deception unraveled when he returned to Rio de Janeiro by private jet (loaned by a businesswoman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>. Federal police recognized him at the airport, and despite initial resistance from Marcos Frota, who believed Marcelo was the real Gol owner, Marcelo was taken to the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. He famously tore up and flushed his fake IDs in the bathroom before questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>. He was subsequently arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

## Life as a Cartel Pilot

Marcelo became a professional pilot for a cartel in Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguay, around 2021, though he started involvement in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Contraband and Drug Smuggling:** He flew planes carrying contraband and drugs ("samba") across the Brazil-Paraguay border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. He diversified his routes, operations, and schedules to avoid detection, becoming indispensable to the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **"Kamikaze" Flights:** He conducted extremely dangerous "Kamikaze" flights to Colombia, flying for many hours over the jungle with precise fuel calculations to reach remote, unmarked runways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. These flights relied on satellite phone calls from an anonymous contact, "Uncle Iridium," who would signal when a window of opportunity existed to cross the border, typically when US surveillance planes were refueling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Losses and Risks:** He admitted to losing friends who ran out of fuel trying to land on unmarked runways that weren't lit up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. He once jettisoned cargo from a twin-engine plane to escape pursuit, as human pilots were more valued than the illicit cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Arrests and Escapes

Marcelo was arrested for a total of 11 years and nine months, often escaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He claimed to have escaped nine times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Prison Life:** He understood the weaknesses of the prison system, observing daily routines to plan escapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>. He gained respect in prison due to his fame and connections with major "heads" from his flying activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. He states the two things the system fears most are rebellion and escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
*   **Bangu Rebellion:** Marcelo denied being a faction leader, stating he was appointed as a spokesperson for both factions during a specific rebellion in Bangu prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. The press sensationalized his role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.

## Later Life and Transformation

[[marcelos_attempts_to_change_his_life_and_work_in_fraud_prevention | Marcelo's decision to stop his criminal activities]] occurred when he agreed to write his book and allow his photo to be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. He knew his actions were wrong but felt there was "no going back" at a certain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. He eventually decided to serve his full sentence to achieve a peaceful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>.

He attributes learning fear to becoming a father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. Today, he works with lectures and consulting, specifically teaching banks how to combat fraud, leveraging his past experiences to predict and prevent new scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. He believes modern technology, while making life easier, has also made it easier for scammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. He advises vigilance against scams, especially those that seem "too good to be true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

He maintains a social media presence on Instagram and YouTube under "Marcelo VIPS Official" to share tips on avoiding trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.

### Key Relationships
*   **Mariana Caltabiano:** The author of his book and director of the VIPS documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. Marcelo famously "scammed" her into paying him more for the rights to his story by claiming another producer had made a better offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. He also consulted her on an aviation accident that involved her relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>.
*   **Ellen (Wife):** His current wife, Ellen, met him in Cuiabá under a false identity and profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>. She discovered his true identity through the press after his arrest in Rondônia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. She chose to stay with him and supported him through his remaining five years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. They have been together for 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.
*   **Children:** He has an older son, Enzo (21 or 22), a daughter, Vitória (22), and a six-year-old son, Davi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. His children are aware of his past and the consequences of his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.

## Notable Incidents
*   **Escaping Hotel as Football Team Observer:** While on the run, he escaped a hotel surrounded by police in Curitiba by disguising himself in a Brazilian national team uniform and posing as a technical observer for a local football team, traveling with them to Cascavel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
*   **Fooled the Americans:** Marcelo claimed to have deceived US narcotics forces by planting a rumor in Colombia that he would acquire a fighter jet to shoot down their helicopters. This caused the Americans to ground their operations, allowing his planes to cross the border freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>. This incident resulted in his name being on a no-entry list for the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>.
*   **Impersonating a Federal Delegate:** He once impersonated a Federal delegate using an old Ministry of Aeronautics card to free a friend from a local police station in Paraná <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.

The age of the universe and Earth is a central point of debate, with differing views based on scientific models and interpretations of evidence.

## The Age of the Universe

### Perspectives on the Big Bang Model
Marcos Eberlin, initially a supporter of the [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | Big Bang model]] for 40 years, began to reevaluate his position in 2008 [00:47:47]. He now believes the model lacks "solid pieces of evidence" [00:49:38] and views its explanations for phenomena like dark matter, shock waves, and inflation as a "cascade of miracles without a Saint" [00:54:01]. He points out that the model begins with a singularity "disconnected from physical laws" [00:49:52] and requires hypothetical components like dark matter to explain gravitational collapse [00:50:26]. He argues that the universe "shouldn't be ready" or structured so early according to the [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | Big Bang model]] [00:53:34].

Felipe and Sérgio Sacani emphasize that the [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | Big Bang]] is a "model" [00:57:24], which involves probabilities and is constantly being refined based on new data [00:58:49]. They assert that the Big Bang model, specifically the Lambda-CDM model, does not claim the universe arose from "nothing" [01:00:54] but describes the evolution from an initial dense, compact state where everything already existed [01:00:43]. They clarify that the model does not attempt to explain how something came from nothing [01:00:57].

### James Webb and Hubble Telescope Observations
Eberlin states that the photos from the Hubble Deep Field and James Webb Space Telescope were "the c pad not the test definitive that the Big Bang does not have scientific feasibility" [00:56:34]. He believes the images of "structured, formed galaxies" [01:14:05] at early cosmic times contradict the Big Bang's predictions of smaller, colliding protogalaxies [01:13:40]. He also notes the presence of "super massive black holes within the galaxy" [01:14:13] in these early galaxies, which he claims would take billions of years to form [01:29:45].

Sérgio Sacani counters that astronomers *expected* to find galaxies in deep field images, citing prior studies from the Palomar telescope dating back to the 1950s [01:03:30]. He shared an email from Robert Williams, who led the Hubble Deep Field project, confirming that they "already knew we would find galaxies in dark regions of the sky" [01:05:17]. Sacani explains that the initially reported "impossible galaxies" from James Webb were "candidates" based on photometry and later, through spectroscopy, many were found to be "much closer" than initially thought due to dust causing a reddish appearance [01:11:05]. He stresses that while the models are being adjusted, this is part of the scientific process [01:59:52].

### Chemical Composition (Metallicity) of Early Galaxies
Adalto and Marcos Eberlin highlight that [[Theories on extraterrestrial life and the universe | James Webb's]] observations show early galaxies containing "metallic chemical elements" [01:32:36] like vanadium, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen [01:31:56]. They argue this is a "problem" [01:32:05] because the early universe, according to the [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | Big Bang model]], should have consisted "basically just hydrogen and helium" [01:32:08], with heavier elements forming much later through successive generations of stars and supernovae [01:27:00, 01:28:04]. Adalto concludes that the presence of these elements "shows that the past and the present are practically the same" [03:06:01], supporting a ready-made, functional universe [03:09:07].

Felipe clarifies that in [[Astronomy and science communication | astronomy]], "metallic" refers to "everything that is beyond the hydrogen and helium" [01:32:38]. While not directly refuting the metallicity claim, the overall defense from Sacani and Felipe is that new data always leads to model refinement rather than outright abandonment [01:59:52].

### Falsifiability and Model Adaptation
Felipe states that the [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | Big Bang model]] is falsifiable; for example, if one were to find a "breaking of isotropy" (meaning the universe is not uniform in all directions) on a large scale, it would falsify the model [01:23:35]. He cites that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) was a prediction of the Big Bang model, found 15 years after its prediction [01:21:07].

Eberlin argues that the Big Bang model is constantly "running after the data" [01:16:30], adapting parameters like dark matter [01:16:01], dark energy [01:16:21], and inflation [01:16:27] to fit observations instead of making accurate predictions. He contends that this is not "good science" [01:15:28]. Adalto agrees that "models that fail in their predictions have to be replaced" [01:34:40].

### The Dark Ages and Star Formation
Eberlin argues that the supposed "Dark Ages" [01:32:20], a period where no stars existed after the [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | Big Bang]], is shrinking in duration with new discoveries, making the formation of massive, complex galaxies in such a short time highly improbable [02:16:28]. He questions how "heavy elements" [02:41:36] could appear so early without prior generations of stars exploding [02:41:30].

João Paulo points out that there is no direct "observation of formation of star" [02:23:36], which Eberlin uses to highlight a gap in the evolutionary model [03:03:56]. However, Sacani counters that astronomers do observe "star clusters" and "anomalous star formation" [02:22:00, 02:25:28] in galaxies, and that new telescopes are expected to provide more data [01:50:14].

### Conclusion on Universe Age
Eberlin concludes that the universe is "young" [03:01:16] and was "made ready" [03:01:46] based on the evidence, which he believes contradicts an old universe that "would be totally worn out today" [01:30:33]. He points to the observation of massive, structured galaxies and black holes in the early universe as primary evidence [02:50:04, 02:50:07]. Adalto supports this, stating that the universe was "brought into existence ready, complete, perfectly functional, complex and not It's been a long time" [03:09:05].

Felipe and Sacani maintain that the existing models of [[Big Bang Theory and Cosmology | cosmology]] are continually refined by new data [01:59:52], and that there is no definitive observation that "breaks" the model [03:10:03]. Pirula emphasizes that new discoveries, like those from [[Theories on extraterrestrial life and the universe | James Webb]], require careful long-term study before definitive conclusions can be drawn, and that current understanding of the universe's age (around 13.8 billion years) is an "interval of time" based on models [03:10:32, 03:10:59, 02:52:04].

## The Age of Earth

### Geological and Astronomical Evidence
Marcos Eberlin, formerly a believer in an old Earth, now argues for a [[Young Earth Creationism | young Earth]] based on several points:
*   **Continental Drift/Plate Tectonics:** He claims that the "perfectly" fitting edges of continents and the presence of identical fossil layers across them suggest the process happened "very quickly" [03:25:23], not over millions of years, as erosion would have worn down the edges [03:25:31].
*   **Moon's Recession:** The Moon is moving away from Earth at 4 cm per year [02:59:27]. If this rate is extrapolated backwards, the Moon would have collided with Earth "1.5 billion years ago" [02:59:31], contradicting the widely accepted age of Earth [03:26:32].
*   **River Deltas:** He argues that the accumulation of river sediments in deltas, like the Amazon, would have filled ocean basins if the Earth were billions of years old, stating that calculations suggest a maximum age of "6,000 years" for deltas like that of the Atlantic [02:58:00, 02:59:02, 03:26:42].
*   **Helium in Atmosphere:** The Earth should have a much larger quantity of Helium in its atmosphere, as it is a product of radioisotope decomposition, if the Earth were billions of years old [02:57:07, 03:27:06].
*   **Ocean Salinity:** The salt content in oceans would either be "extremely salty" or "without salt" if the processes of salt input and removal had occurred for billions of years, implying a younger age [02:57:21, 03:27:38].
*   **Jupiter's Heat:** Jupiter radiates "twice as much heat as it absorbs from the sun" [02:59:09] and is like a "hot potato in the freezer" [02:59:22], which is inconsistent with an old solar system, suggesting it is still cooling from a recent formation [02:59:02].
*   **Magnetic Fields:** The existence of a "magnetic field immense" [02:59:52] on Jupiter and Earth indicates a relatively recent formation, as magnetic fields decay over time [02:59:45].

Sérgio Sacani (geophysicist) and Pirula (paleontologist) generally state that these are not problems for the accepted scientific models, which are constantly being updated with new data. Sacani explains that "continental drift" is now understood as "plate tectonics" [03:33:02], where the Earth's crust is divided into plates moving over a solid-behaving magma layer due to pressure [03:33:50]. He mentions that the movement rate is "3 cm per year" [03:40:43], which is very slow, but still allows for the formation of large geological features.

### [[Biblical Archaeology and Historical Evidence | Historical and Biological Evidence]]
Marcos Eberlin presents additional evidence for a [[Young Earth Creationism | young Earth]]:
*   **Carbon-14:** Carbon-14, with a half-life of 5,730 years, is found in "diamond," "fossil," and all organic material on Earth [03:27:40, 03:27:54]. He argues that its presence in materials supposedly millions of years old is inconsistent with deep time, as it should have decayed completely [03:28:09].
*   **Oldest Trees:** The oldest living trees, like the Methuselah pine (4,800 years) and the Grandfather Pine (5,000 years) [03:28:46], suggest a maximum age for Earth [03:28:43].
*   **History of Civilizations and Writing:** The history of human civilizations and writing dates back "no more than 6,000 years" [03:29:11], implying a recent origin for humanity.
*   **Human Genetics:** DNA sequencing of mitochondria and the Y chromosome indicates that "all humans come from the same woman, the mitochondrial Eve" [03:29:30], and "from the same the the same the man who inhabited the earth 6,000 years ago" [03:29:43].
*   **Deleterious Mutations:** The human genome project shows that humans are accumulating "deleterious mutations" (defects) at a rate of "50 to 100 mutations per generation" [03:29:56]. He argues that if humanity were ancient, the accumulation of these mutations would have led to extinction, supporting a recent origin of 6,000 years [03:30:37].

Pirula, a biologist and paleontologist, implies that these claims are either misinterpretations or oversimplifications, and that the scientific community overwhelmingly supports an old Earth and universe. He refers to these arguments as common "scarecrows" [03:22:38] used in online debates, which are easily refuted within academic science.

### Conclusion on Earth Age
Eberlin states that he "surrendered to the data" and became a "Young Earth" advocate [03:31:47], emphasizing that this conclusion is based on scientific evidence rather than religious reasons [03:31:52]. He argues that the "balance of evidence" points to a young Earth [03:32:10]. Adalto agrees, stating that the "scientific evidence points in a very simple and calm this universe was brought into existence ready complete perfectly functional complex and not It's been a long time" [03:09:00].

Pirula emphasizes that the claims made by Eberlin and Adalto contradict "gigantic" amounts of evidence [02:10:04]. He states that "nothing points to the idea completely stromb colic that the universe has 6,000 years or something like that" [02:02:06] and that such ideas are "impossible within an assessment scientific" [02:57:55] unless one appeals to "miracle" [02:03:03]. He concludes that the vast majority of scientists do not support a [[Young Earth Creationism | 6,000-year-old universe]] [03:11:29].

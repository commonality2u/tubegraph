## Introduction
On October 7th, 2023, a surprise attack by [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]] on Israel marked an unprecedented escalation in the [[conflict_in_israel_and_palestine | conflict]] between the two entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:45">[08:24:45]</a>. This event has been widely compared to 9/11 for its scale and surprise, and even to Pearl Harbor due to its unexpected nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:01">[08:42:01]</a>. It is considered the largest terrorist attack in Israel's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:05">[08:35:05]</a>.

## The Hamas Attack
The attack began in the early morning, with sirens ringing and widespread missile launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:33">[04:54:33]</a>. It included a ground invasion, with terrorists infiltrating Israeli territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:44">[07:07:44]</a>. The scale of the invasion was a significant failure of Israeli intelligence, defense, and monitoring systems, as no one imagined an attack of this proportion would be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:09">[10:41:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:01">[10:42:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:17">[10:46:17]</a>.

Reports from the ground were horrific, detailing abuses against women, kidnapped children, and elderly individuals, demonstrating extreme cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:07">[06:09:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:15">[06:14:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:07">[06:18:07]</a>. Casualties were significant, with initial reports nearing 1000 Israeli deaths, a number proportionally higher than the 9/11 death toll for the U.S. population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:41:50">[37:41:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:14">[38:04:14]</a>. Over 100 people were kidnapped, with estimates ranging from 130 to 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:39">[11:15:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:05">[11:21:05]</a>.

### A Survivor's Account
Rafael Zimerman, a Brazilian citizen who recently moved to Israel seeking security, recounted his experience of surviving the attack at a festival near the Gaza border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:29:43">[43:29:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:02">[43:40:02]</a>.

He described the sudden onset of missile attacks at 6 AM, leading to panic and a scramble for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:57:42">[43:57:42]</a>. He, along with his friends, sought refuge in a small public bunker designed for aerial bomb protection, where 40-50 people crammed into a tiny space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00:23">[46:00:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:31:07">[46:31:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:45:07">[46:45:07]</a>. The bunker was attacked with grenades and gunfire, and smoke grenades were deployed to suffocate those inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:00:03">[47:00:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:04">[48:40:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:32:00">[49:32:00]</a>. Zimerman played dead, lying among bodies for five hours, enduring intense suffering and believing he would die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:48:40">[49:48:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:09:47">[51:09:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:44">[51:28:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00:09">[52:00:09]</a>. Ultimately, he was rescued by police, one of only a few survivors from the bunker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:09">[50:49:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:14:03">[51:14:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:11">[51:16:11]</a>.

He noted the presence of people of all nationalities at the festival—Jewish, Christian, Arab, Brazilian, Thai, German—highlighting that the attack was against "life" itself, not just specific groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:16:04">[50:16:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:21:40">[50:21:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:04">[50:31:04]</a>.

## The Nature of Terrorism
Terrorism is defined as a form of political force with a political objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:46">[09:35:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:15">[09:53:15]</a>. Unlike common criminal organizations, terrorist groups aim to destroy or recreate states, or achieve political autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:36">[09:59:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:37">[10:07:37]</a>. The recent attack demonstrated that terrorism as a political weapon is "alive and well" and can cause "frightening damage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:05">[10:23:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:07">[10:31:07]</a>.

[[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas's]] tactics, including filming atrocities, are intended to create terror and demonstrate strength, which they believe garners respect and legitimacy among those Palestinians who see armed resistance as the only solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:25">[38:51:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:08">[39:19:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:05">[39:31:05]</a>. They are not concerned with [[international_perspectives_on_israel_and_palestine | public opinion]] in the traditional sense, but rather with internal feedback and demonstrating their power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:06">[26:45:06]</a>. The group's founding charter openly states antisemitic views and opposition to Israel's existence, making negotiation with them effectively impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:17">[02:51:17]</a>.

## Israel's Response and Internal Dynamics
Israel declared war on [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]] following the surprise attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:36">[05:22:36]</a>. The immediate aftermath saw a profound shift in [[the_nature_of_israeli_domestic_politics_and_societal_response_to_conflict | Israeli domestic politics]], as a previously divided society united to defend the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:28">[07:09:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:23">[07:18:23]</a>. Opposition parties joined the government to form a single consensus government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:05">[13:06:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:15">[13:17:15]</a>. This unity is reinforced by Israel's history of being "forged in combat" and constantly surrounded by enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.

The attack exposed significant failures in Israel's intelligence and defense, which had become complacent about the threat from Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:09">[10:41:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:58">[15:46:58]</a>. There's an ongoing discussion about how the intelligence system failed, particularly given the focus on the West Bank (Sis Jordan) due to the policies of Netanyahu's right-wing government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. The division caused by the proposed judicial reform may have contributed to a reduced focus on external threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. The terrorists' ability to breach advanced border defenses, possibly aided by equipment that interfered with Israeli electronic systems, was a major surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:08">[29:49:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:28">[31:13:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>.

The military strategy employed by [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]] was a "paradoxical logic" – attacking directly through the heavily fortified fence, rather than relying on tunnels, which Israel had come to expect and focus on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:40">[28:02:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:04">[29:16:04]</a>.

## External Influences and Geopolitics
Iran is identified as a key financier and supporter of [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]], with meetings between Iranian Revolutionary Guard leadership and terrorist groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah occurring since April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>. This support includes weapons and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:02">[33:40:02]</a>. The attack also disrupted a potential peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which was seen as a threat by these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

The United States has sent aircraft carriers to the region, signaling a clear message of support for Israel and deterring any other country or group from launching a joint attack to overthrow Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:26:50">[35:26:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:08">[35:33:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:08">[35:40:08]</a>.

## The Gaza Strip and Settlements
The narrative of Gaza being the "largest open-air prison in the world" is challenged, with the argument that [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]] itself created this situation by declaring war on Israel and maintaining control, leading to Israel's necessary border closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>. Egypt's refusal to open its border with Gaza is cited as evidence of Hamas's dangerous nature, as Egypt views the group as a threat and a criminal, violent, and terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>.

[[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]] is not seen as representing all Palestinians, having taken power by force in Gaza and established a dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20:00">[25:20:00]</a>. The idea that Israel financed [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]] to counterbalance the PLO is dismissed as a misunderstanding of history; Israel's support for a religious structure in Gaza in the 70s aimed to promote religious study among youth, not to fund a militant organization like Hamas, which was founded later in 1988 with an anti-Semitic and anti-Israel charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:56">[02:39:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:11">[02:40:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:02">[02:41:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:54">[02:43:54]</a>.

Regarding settlements in the West Bank (Sis Jordan), they are seen as a controversial issue for negotiation but not the primary cause of the lack of peace, as peace proposals existed even before the major expansion of settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:46">[02:49:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:21">[02:50:21]</a>. For [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]], there is no ideological difference between a settlement in the West Bank and any Israeli city like Tel Aviv; they seek the removal of all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:05">[02:53:05]</a>.

## Implications and Future Outlook
The attack has significantly impacted the ongoing discussions about Iran's nuclear program. Israel has long tried to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and this event strengthens Israel's resolve to act militarily against Iranian nuclear facilities if necessary, even without U.S. support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:26">[01:59:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:45">[02:02:45]</a>. The potential for a nuclear Iran, especially if it were to share technology with groups like [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]], is seen as a "gigantic nightmare" for global security, as these fragile countries could lead to nuclear terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:39">[02:06:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:13">[02:07:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:38">[02:07:38]</a>.

The attack is not considered the start of a Third World War but rather a localized [[conflict_in_israel_and_palestine | conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:41">[02:53:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>. However, it highlights a broader [[geopolitical_analysis_and_implications | geopolitical analysis]] of converging crises, including the return of terrorism, increased state-on-state conflict, nuclear proliferation concerns, and rising extremism in democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:50">[02:54:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">[02:55:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:46">[02:56:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:16">[02:57:16]</a>. This complex global landscape requires careful understanding of geopolitics to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:07">[02:59:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:12">[02:59:12]</a>.

The long-term impact on Israel's population, particularly those near Gaza, will be immense due to the trauma and the difficulty of returning to normal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:25">[02:10:25]</a>.

## Call for Global Condemnation
There is a strong call for global unanimity in condemning [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]] as a terrorist organization, unequivocally separating its actions from the legitimate Palestinian cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:51">[02:15:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:04">[02:17:04]</a>. Relativizing [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas's]] actions is seen as a sign of cognitive flaw or even complicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:10">[02:16:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:21">[02:16:21]</a>. The president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, of Palestinian origin, stated that [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]] "should disappear" for the good of the Palestinian people, who "must get rid of these animals and let people prosper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:15">[03:00:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>. This sentiment suggests a potential shift among Palestinians in recognizing the harm [[hamas_and_its_influence | Hamas]] inflicts on their own cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:05">[03:04:05]</a>.

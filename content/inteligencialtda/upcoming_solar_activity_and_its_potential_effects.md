The Sun, a star, exhibits complex magnetic phenomena due to its differential rotation, meaning parts of it rotate faster than others because it is a plasma, not a solid body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:55">[01:45:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:31">[01:46:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:40">[01:46:40]</a>. This differential rotation causes the Sun's magnetic field to become messy and tangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>.

## Solar Cycle and Explosions
When numerous magnetic field lines converge in one area, they prevent heat from being transported, forming cooler, darker regions known as sunspots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:26">[01:47:26]</a>. The Sun experiences an 11-year cycle during which the number of these sunspots increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:16">[01:48:16]</a>. As these magnetic field lines become increasingly tangled, they can eventually break, resulting in a solar flare or explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:37">[01:48:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:52">[01:48:52]</a>.

### 2024: A Peak Year
The year 2024 is projected to be the peak (maximum) of the current solar cycle, meaning there will be more sunspots and, consequently, more solar explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:14">[01:49:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:20">[01:49:20]</a>. This is a natural phenomenon of the Sun and is unrelated to Earth's [[Climate Change and Environmental Impact | greenhouse effect]] or temperature increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:26">[01:49:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>.

## Potential Effects on Earth
Humanity today is highly dependent on technology, including GPS, banking systems, traffic lights, and air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:43">[01:49:43]</a>. Solar flares release numerous charged particles, such as electrons, from the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:31">[01:50:31]</a>. If these particles, sometimes referred to as solar wind, are directed towards Earth and hit satellites, they can cause problems due to the sensitive electronic circuits within the satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:38">[01:50:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:07">[01:51:07]</a>. A large, giant explosion, called a coronal mass ejection (CME), involves a massive release of particles that could damage satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:17">[01:51:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:20">[01:51:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:28">[01:51:28]</a>. If many satellites are damaged, there could be internet outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:28">[01:51:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:31">[01:51:31]</a>.

### Real-World Impact
A recent solar explosion caused a glitch in satellites, lasting about 20 to 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:09">[01:57:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:13">[01:57:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:20">[01:57:20]</a>. This affected Azul airline's ATR planes, which rely solely on GPS for navigation and do not have an inertial gyroscope system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:39">[01:57:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:15">[01:58:15]</a>. As a result, several ATR planes were unable to take off, causing significant disruption and flight cancellations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:20">[01:58:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>. One plane even had to return from takeoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:50">[01:58:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:53">[01:58:53]</a>. Such events can cause temporary disorders, but the world is preparing for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:13">[01:59:13]</a>.

## Monitoring and Preparedness
The Sun is extensively monitored by numerous space probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:41">[01:51:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:13">[01:52:13]</a>. Organizations like NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) provide daily and even minute-by-minute updates on solar activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:43">[01:51:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>.

If a major solar flare is detected, it takes approximately three days for the charged particles to reach Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:22">[01:53:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:24">[01:53:24]</a>. This provides sufficient time to maneuver satellites, protecting them from the solar storm by moving them or turning off sensitive components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:37">[01:53:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:37">[01:56:37]</a>. While very large events might still cause some damage, it is highly unlikely to be without internet for "months and months" due to these protective measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:41">[01:53:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:48">[01:53:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.

The Earth naturally undergoes cycles of heating and cooling. However, when analyzing [[climate_change_and_mass_extinctions | climate changes]], scientists initially account for these natural fluctuations using algorithms to focus on other influencing factors [03:41:40]. The current trend shows a "violent upward trend" in global temperatures [03:03:04].

## Indicators of Climate Change
Climate change causes events to become more frequent and extreme [02:50:48].

### Hurricanes
Hurricanes are becoming more intense and frequent [02:50:48]. For example, before, there might have been two or three Category 3 hurricanes in a year, but now there are five Category 4 and 5 hurricanes annually [03:00:04]. Hurricanes need hot water to feed [02:37:17], weakening when they enter the continent [02:11:17]. The Gulf of Mexico is described as a "hurricane factory" due to its very warm water [02:30:32].

### Tornadoes
Brazil experiences tornadoes, especially in the central-west region, extending from Santa Catarina to Campinas [02:57:52]. Unlike hurricanes, tornadoes require very dry air and occur only on land [02:57:39]. People often mistake tornadoes for gales [02:11:17], but twisted posts indicate a tornado [02:17:17]. Meteorology now more widely discloses these phenomena, helping people understand they are indeed tornadoes [02:42:17].

### Rainfall Patterns and Droughts
Climate change alters rainfall regimes [03:10:17]. Brazil experienced a water crisis due to a lack of rain that started three to four years prior, and the Pantanal fires in the previous year will have an effect in two to three years [03:01:17]. The issue is not just a lack of rain, but that rain falls in the "wrong place," often where areas are unprepared for the volume, leading to accidents [03:02:10]. This also impacts agriculture, as altered rain schedules can disrupt planting and harvesting [03:33:50].

## Historical Impacts
Past events demonstrate Earth's vulnerability to celestial impacts and solar activity.

### Asteroid and Comet Impacts
The DART mission was the first test of [[Asteroids and comets impact on Earth | planetary defense]], aiming to divert an asteroid, not destroy it, countering a common misconception that it involved an atomic bomb [09:12:17].

*   **Chelyabinsk Meteor (2013):** A small meteor (10-20 meters) exploded in Russia's atmosphere, injuring 1,500-1,600 people due to broken glass, but causing no fatalities. It was considered lucky it didn't hit the ground directly [09:50:17].
*   **Tunguska Event (1908):** An object struck Russia, flattening trees and causing interference with transmissions. No crater or meteorite was found, suggesting it either exploded in the atmosphere or bounced off it [12:53:17].
*   **Dinosaur Extinction:** A comet or asteroid fragment impacted Earth 66 million years ago, causing the fifth great [[climate_change_and_mass_extinctions | mass extinction]] [11:37:17]. This event decimated 75% of species [11:49:17]. The impact created a massive cloud, leading to forest destruction and the death of grass-eating dinosaurs. Some deep-diving and aquatic dinosaurs survived [12:15:17].
*   **Future Threats:** Asteroids between 40 and 150 meters in diameter are concerning because they can cause local (city-level) or regional destruction [14:53:17]. Larger asteroids are generally mapped, providing a sense of calm for the next 100 years [14:31:17]. Comets, however, are larger (hundreds of thousands of kilometers) and unpredictable, making them potentially catastrophic if they were to hit Earth [17:48:17].

### Solar Flares
The Carrington Event in 1859, a major solar flare, burned the entire telegraph network on Earth [13:12:17]. Such an event today would be much worse, potentially destroying the internet and other critical infrastructure [13:20:17].

## Climate System Complexity
The climate system is highly complex and sensitive, illustrating the "butterfly effect" [03:20:20]. Small modifications, like changes in rainfall patterns or hotter summers, accumulate over time [03:08:17]. The system has inertia; effects aren't instantaneous but propagate over two to three years [03:31:24]. This delay means that the consequences of events, like the Pantanal fires, will be felt years later [03:57:17].

Scientists use complex computational models and [[The Impact of Technology on Society | Artificial Intelligence]] to predict these long-term effects [03:40:17]. These predictions are crucial for preparation, such as anticipating a water crisis in three years based on current rainfall regime changes [03:56:17]. The visible changes in eternally icy peaks serve as a stark indicator of ongoing transformation [03:06:09].

## Social Implications of Climate Change
Climate change can lead to significant social effects. If areas become unsuitable for certain agriculture (e.g., soybean in Mato Grosso), populations may migrate, exacerbating issues in already crowded cities like SÃ£o Paulo [03:49:17]. Such migrations could also introduce new diseases or pests to unprepared regions, leading to public health crises [03:06:09].

## Experts and Awareness
Climatologists study the climate system holistically to provide accurate predictions [03:52:26]. There's a spectrum of beliefs about climate change, from alarmists to deniers, but understanding the cumulative and non-instantaneous nature of its effects is crucial [03:41:40]. Experts like those from the IPCC explain that the issue goes beyond just "global warming" and encompasses various interconnected changes [03:39:41].

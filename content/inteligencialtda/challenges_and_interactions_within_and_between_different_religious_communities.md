## A Historic Interfaith Gathering

A podcast episode brought together a Rabbi, a Priest, and a Pastor in a "historic night" aimed at expanding knowledge and exploring commonalities and differences between religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The intention was to foster [[faith_and_spirituality_discussions | dialogue]] and understand what unites and differentiates their faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

The hosts emphasized the importance of respect and avoiding profanity during the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The format encouraged audience participation through super chats for questions and comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Bridging Theological Divides

The discussion quickly moved beyond superficial differences, aiming for "intelligent dialogue" to find "fields of confluence" and create unity and communion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

### The Nature of Faith: Doctrinal vs. Relational
A key point of [[faith_and_spirituality_discussions | discussion]] revolved around the nature of faith:
*   **Doctrinal Faith**: This refers to beliefs or dogmas, such as a Jew fasting on Yom Kippur or wearing a kippah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. For Catholics, it includes believing in the Holy Sacrament or the intercession of saints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. For Adventists, it involves the return of Jesus and Sabbath keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.
*   **Relational Faith**: This is a personal connection with the Creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. Doctrinal faith only makes sense if there is a relationship with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. The essence of faith is found in the person, which ultimately leads to faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

> <p class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</p>
>In essence, unity; non-essential diversity; in everything, charity.

This concept allows for unity even amidst disagreements on specific beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

### Shared Foundations: Abraham and the One God
All three religious leaders agreed on the existence of **one God** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. If this one God created all human beings, then all people are brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

*   The Jewish people received a mission from Abraham, who was tasked with leaving his home and evolving spiritually through trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. This journey culminated in Abraham earning the title of Patriarch of the people of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   The God of Israel cannot be only from Israel; God spoke to Abraham to "be blessed all peoples of the earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   The essence of the Jewish people is to recognize and give thanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:09">[02:52:09]</a>.

### Divergent Views on Salvation and Messiah
Despite common ground, clear theological differences were acknowledged:

*   **Mary's Virginity**: A 25-year-old class discussion was recounted regarding Mary's virginity after childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. An Adventist pastor defended Mary's virginity during childbirth, arguing that since Eve had pain in childbirth due to sin, Mary, being sinless, would not have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Merit vs. Grace**: A significant difference lies in the concept of salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. In Pauline (Christian) understanding, salvation is not meritorious but a result of Christ's death on the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>, whereas Jewish thought emphasizes keeping the Torah or law for salvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
*   **Jesus as Messiah**: For Judaism, Jesus was a Jew but not God or the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:02">[02:58:02]</a>, whereas Christianity believes in Jesus as the Messiah who will return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:18">[03:02:18]</a>.

## Respect, Coexistence, and Overcoming Prejudice

The participants stressed the importance of mutual respect, even with differing convictions. One speaker said: "I must never deny what I believe, but respect the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.

### Personal Experiences of Interfaith Relations
*   The Rabbi recounted being respected by a Catholic seminary that prepared special food for him, avoiding pork, a forbidden food in Judaism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. Conversely, he allowed an Adventist student to miss Sunday activities for church programming, demonstrating mutual respect for [[the_role_and_influence_of_religion_in_family_life | religious]] observance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.
*   The Pastor shared a story of being welcomed to study for his master's degree at a Jesuit institution, despite being Adventist, while some teachers were bothered by his presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:11">[02:28:11]</a>. He was later expelled from his doctorate for "controversial" ideas but was supported by some Catholic priests who recognized his right not to be discriminated against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:51">[02:31:51]</a>.

### Historical Contexts and Modern Relevance
*   The **Holocaust** was discussed as a period where the true nature of human beings was revealed, highlighting those who "stretched the blanket" to help others, and those who became "pigs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:12">[02:41:12]</a>.
*   The **Inquisition** and **Protestant Reformation** (Luther's anti-Semitism) were mentioned as periods of Jewish persecution, leading to many Jews hiding their identity through name changes to avoid persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:25">[02:55:25]</a>.
*   The minister of King Fernando, Dom Isaac Abravanel, was highlighted as a leader who abandoned his fortune to flee with his people during persecution, demonstrating true leadership by staying with the community in difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:28">[02:57:28]</a>.
*   Stories of priests and pastors who saved Jews during the war were also shared, highlighting interfaith cooperation in times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:22">[02:58:22]</a>.

## The Role of Knowledge and Dialogue
The podcast itself was framed as an exercise in "intelligent conversation" where diverse perspectives could find common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:20">[03:09:20]</a>.

*   **Faith and Intelligence**: The concept of "intelligent faith" was introduced, distinguishing it from fundamentalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:16">[01:59:16]</a>. True intelligence means being willing to "read inside" and open to learning, rather than seeing faith as the opposite of intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.
*   **Biblical Archaeology**: The pastor, a biblical archaeologist, shared his work, including a 2300-year-old brick from Babylon with Nebuchadnezzar's inscription, which was seen by the prophet Daniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:15">[02:24:15]</a>. This emphasizes the historical grounding of biblical narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:22">[02:29:22]</a>.
*   **Translation and Interpretation**: Saint Jerome's 40-year effort to translate the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate) was discussed, highlighting the challenges of translating ancient texts and the loss of "essence" in translation from original Hebrew, a language believed to be used in creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:40">[02:12:40]</a>.
*   **Unity in Diversity**: Even within the same faith, there are diverse interpretations and customs, for example, among different Jewish communities due to exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:17">[02:51:17]</a>. The goal is to acknowledge these differences while maintaining unity in core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>.

## Shared Human Experience and Hope for the Future
Despite doctrinal differences, the participants identified universal human experiences and a shared hope.

*   **The Longing for Paradise**: A profound human desire for happiness and a return to "paradise" was expressed, described as a "hunger for happiness" and a "longing for Paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. This is seen as an unconscious memory of a lost place, a "memory of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.
*   **Eschatology (End Times)**: All three traditions have a concept of end times. Judaism awaits the coming of the Messiah who will rebuild the Temple and bring world peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>. Christianity, including Catholicism, believes in the "Second Coming" of Jesus, who will return to judge the living and the dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:18">[03:02:18]</a>. This shared hope provides motivation and meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:29">[03:14:29]</a>.
*   **Living a Meaningful Life**: Life is seen as a corridor to a greater hall, a stage for planting to reap later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:26">[03:36:26]</a>. The purpose of existence, by Judaism, is to have pleasure, with the greatest pleasure being loving God's creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:07">[03:48:07]</a>. The importance of appreciating small, everyday miracles was stressed as a key to happiness, and avoiding "getting used to" the blessings of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:14">[03:18:14]</a>.

> [!info] The concept of "eternal now"
> In Catholicism, time is viewed as becoming eternal, and we should not be swallowed by "Cronus" (linear time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Instead, we should embrace "Kairos," the time of grace, the opportune moment, an "eternal now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. This suggests that the focus should be on the quality of life lived rather than just its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>.

## The Importance of Respectful Dialogue
The overall message was that despite deep-seated differences, peaceful and respectful dialogue is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>. The goal is not to convert others but to genuinely understand and respect differing [[faith_and_spirituality_discussions | beliefs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>.

> [!quote] The essence of living with differences
> "Knowing how to live is you being able to live with people who think different than you and you don't cancel, hate them and try to exterminate them. I think that humanity already in the 21st century of life evolve in this sense and it is still very later than it should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:12">[03:30:12]</a>.

The discussion served as a powerful example of how different religious communities can interact positively, find common ground, and learn from each other's unique strengths, demonstrating that "the common points, they are much bigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:39">[03:42:39]</a>. This approach encourages appreciating the "seeds of truth" scattered across all human religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:33">[03:31:33]</a>.

## Overview of Early Career and Media Scrutiny

[[Danilo Gentili | Danilo Gentili]] describes his career as marked by instances of being "persecuted" in Brazil, with consistent attempts to derail his trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His early experiences in television provided a foundation for his comedic style, which often intersected with political and social commentary.

### Inexperienced Reporter on CQC

Gentili's first notable television role was as an "inexperienced reporter" on the program *CQC* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. He was the only cast member on a temporary contract, hired for a mere three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. He capitalized on his initial discomfort and lack of experience, turning it into a running gag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

During this period, he faced significant challenges, including being expelled from the São Paulo City Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> and later from Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. These expulsions occurred after he posed a question about a "cash register" to Arlindo Quinália, a PT leader at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Gentili perceived the Workers' Party (PT) as "spoiled by the press" because journalists were hesitant to ask them tough questions, a void he aimed to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Political Satire and Public Backlash

Gentili draws parallels between his experiences and those of [[Wilson Simonal | Wilson Simonal]], describing Simonal as "the first cancelled in Brazil" before the internet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. He notes that similar attempts to "cancel" him occur almost monthly, but the internet allows him to fight back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Referencing [[Casseta e Planeta | Casseta e Planeta]], Gentili recalls Claudio Manoel's observation that while satirizing presidents like Itamar and Collor was acceptable, mocking Lula led to retaliation and changes in public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Gentili asserts that the "progressive left" is treated as "sacrosanct," immune to criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. He also critiques political figures who adopt a "good guy mask" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Stand-up Comedy and Initial Controversies

His transition into [[Danilo Gentilis standup comedy career and challenges | stand-up comedy]] saw him quickly gain recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. In 2010, he performed a "politically incorrect" show in Brasília, which he describes as historic because no one had dared to satirize all political figures equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>. The show targeted multiple politicians, including Lula and Dilma, with what he called "very heavy jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.

This show gained significant media attention, trending on Twitter for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:57">[01:47:57]</a>. Following this, Gentili observed a shift in how he was covered by the press, particularly from the "journalism class." They began to scrutinize his work, "looking for hair on the egg" and decontextualizing his statements to label them as offensive or threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a>. This marked the beginning of public debate around the "limit of humor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:32">[01:49:32]</a>.

## Specific Accusations and Legal Battles

Danilo Gentili recounts several instances of direct accusations and legal actions against him.

### "Cow" Joke Controversy

One notable controversy involved a joke about a woman who was a large milk donor, which he performed in 2013 on Band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:12">[02:10:12]</a>. The joke was based on a news story from a "bizarre world" website, highlighting the absurdity of a person wanting to enter the Guinness Book of Records as the biggest milk donor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:43">[02:11:43]</a>. The joke itself compared her situation to a "Kid Bengala" entering her place as the biggest milk producer, playing on the word "milk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:52">[02:12:52]</a>.

However, the media, particularly certain press offices and publications, allegedly distorted this by publishing headlines claiming Gentili "called for milk donor of cow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>. This led to a narrative that the woman was crying because Gentili had called her a "cow," dried up her milk, and caused her to be called a "cow" on the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>. Gentili refutes this, stating he never used the word "cow" in the joke, and the media actively ignored video evidence of the performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:33">[02:19:33]</a>. He believes this was a manufactured narrative to portray him as a "white male oppressor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:50">[02:19:50]</a>.

Gentili claims he lost a lawsuit related to this, despite presenting evidence that he did not use the offensive term, due to "pressure" and the established "narrative" of him being a villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:44">[02:20:44]</a>.

### Other Accusations and Legal Challenges

*   **Rape Apology Allegations**: Gentili describes losing a sponsorship deal after a coordinated online attack falsely accused him of endorsing rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:19">[02:04:19]</a>. This was tied to a tweet from ten years prior about a Big Brother couple, which was decontextualized and shared widely as if it related to a recent rape case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:09">[02:05:09]</a>. He was accused of creating a "culture of rape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:49">[02:05:49]</a>.
*   **Maria do Rosário Lawsuit**: Gentili was "sentenced to prison in first instance" in a lawsuit filed by Maria do Rosário, a politician, over a tweet from 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:59">[02:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:43">[02:08:43]</a>. He attributes this to a political agenda, stating that criticizing the PT or Dilma often leads to accusations of sexism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>.
*   **Manuela d'Ávila Lawsuit**: He faced a criminal indictment from Manuela d'Ávila, a politician, over a tweet from 2018 that criticized her for perceived hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:57">[02:02:57]</a>. He notes that such politicians use public funds to finance lawsuits against critics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:42">[02:03:42]</a>.
*   **"Hate Cabinets" and Fake News**: Gentili claims that during the Dilma/PT government, "hate cabinets" or "fake news" operations were run by their supporters to target critics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:53">[02:22:53]</a>. He also mentions the existence of a "blacklist" of journalists considered "enemies" of the PT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:32">[01:56:32]</a>.

## Perceptions and Ongoing Challenges

Gentili believes that in Brazilian media, there is a "two weights and two measures" approach where critics of left-wing figures are disproportionately attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>. He notes that while "bolsomions" (supporters of Bolsonaro) may attack on Twitter, "progressives attack in the newsroom of newspapers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07">[02:22:07]</a>. He views this as a struggle against censorship and a fight for artistic freedom, stating that comedians should have the liberty to mock any president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. He asserts that he will continue to create humor as he sees fit, regardless of the government in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:44">[02:24:44]</a>.

He highlights that many comedians who remained quiet during previous governments have now become vocal critics of the current administration, which he views critically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:58">[02:24:58]</a>. Gentili asserts that his focus remains on his craft, always choosing to act with integrity and avoiding unnecessary conflict, even when facing disloyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:37">[02:33:37]</a>.

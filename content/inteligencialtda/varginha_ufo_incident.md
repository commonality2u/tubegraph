The [[Varginha UFO incident]] is considered one of the three major cases in Brazilian ufology, alongside [[operation_saucer_in_Brazil | Operation Saucer]] and the Official Night of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>. Occurring in January 1996 in Varginha, Minas Gerais, it is noted for being a more recent case with considerable evidence compared to older incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>.

## Initial Event

On January 20, 1996, an object, described as a ship, either crashed or was shot down in Varginha, Minas Gerais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:57">[02:30:57]</a>. Witnesses described it descending with white smoke and a swinging piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:06">[02:32:06]</a>. There is information suggesting the object was "beaten by Norad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:15">[02:31:15]</a>. Following the crash, creatures were reportedly seen jumping from the ship and taking refuge in a forest known as the Andere Garden. They later spread due to the nearby Green River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:15">[02:32:15]</a>.

## Creature Sightings and Capture

Multiple accounts describe the creatures:
*   At least four creatures were captured, possibly more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:28">[02:32:28]</a>.
*   They were seen crouched and described as having a helmet-like appearance with golden and red eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:09">[02:45:09]</a>.
*   One witness, Dona Terezinha, saw a creature with a golden "helmet" and red eyes grabbing a fence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:09">[02:45:09]</a>.
*   Another report from a soldier in Rio Verde in July 1996 describes a "hairy creature" about 1.60m tall, dark brown, with red eyes and horns, seen leaving a river bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:06">[02:51:06]</a>. This suggests a potential "Tony Ramos" type creature, in contrast to the smooth-skinned ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:41">[02:51:41]</a>. Both types reportedly shared similar eye characteristics and bumps on the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>.

Some captured creatures were allegedly taken to hospitals in Varginha, including Regional Humanitas Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:42">[02:32:42]</a>. One creature reportedly died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:49">[02:32:49]</a>. Live and dead creatures were then transported by train to Badan Palhares at Unicamp, though he denies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:54">[02:32:54]</a>. The creatures were also allegedly taken to SPECEX (a pink building in Campinas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:21">[02:33:21]</a>.

## Alleged Cover-up and US Involvement

According to investigations, military bodies (Army, Military Police, firefighters) and hospital staff (Regional Humanitas, Unicamp) were involved in covering up and denying the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:07">[02:52:07]</a>.

American involvement is also alleged:
*   On January 20, 1996, a plane arrived in Campinas, where two Aeronautics helicopters were prepared to take Americans to Varginha to begin the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:38">[02:31:38]</a>.
*   One of the creatures reportedly never passed through Unicamp but went directly to a US base, and then possibly to Iperó, São Paulo, a maximum-security Navy base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:30">[02:37:30]</a>.
*   There are documents from the North American embassy that discuss agreements between the Brazilian Air Force and NASA regarding technological exchange, suggesting Brazil's technological Area 51 (São José dos Campos) sends material to NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:08">[02:39:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:33">[02:39:33]</a>.
*   A US Air Force pilot is alleged to have transported the ship from Varginha with the bodies to the United States and is expected to report this to the US Congress in a public hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:47">[02:54:47]</a>.

## Physical Evidence and Impacts

### Animal Deaths at Varginha Zoo
Following the sightings, animals at the Varginha zoo, particularly those with different eating habits, began to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:37">[02:46:37]</a>. This included a tapir, a blue macaw, and a red deer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:42">[02:46:42]</a>. Autopsies revealed the animals died from an "unknown caustic substance" that poisoned them via cutaneous contact, rather than ingestion, causing tissue necrosis from bottom to top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:24">[02:47:24]</a>. These deaths coincidentally align with the death of Marco Eli Chereze, a soldier who reportedly took a scratch and died from a strong, strange bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:03">[02:48:03]</a>.

### Medical Reports
Doctors and coroners involved in the case have spoken about the "strange" nature of the physical evidence, though they often stop short of explicitly attributing it to [[alien_sightings_and_UFOs | aliens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:29">[02:48:29]</a>.

### Missing Evidence
Despite claims of photographic and film evidence, actual film and photos of the creatures are scarce or held secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:09">[02:26:09]</a>. There are reports, including official military documents, that mention video recordings of objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>. However, requests for these videos via information freedom laws have been met with denials, stating no video exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>.

## Controversy and Current Status

The [[Varginha UFO incident]] is considered uncontroversial among ufologists, with real facts and ongoing judicial review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:39">[02:25:39]</a>. However, there is a divergence of opinion, with some researchers, under perceived pressure, retracting previous statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>.

Recently, the case has regained prominence, partly due to documentary filmmaker James Fox offering a substantial reward (originally $200,000, later increased to R$1 million) for an authentic photo or video of the "ET" from Varginha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>. This has raised concerns about the potential for fake evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:41">[02:29:41]</a>.

A memorial dedicated to the [[Varginha UFO incident]] has been inaugurated in Varginha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:23">[02:55:23]</a>, and a book detailing memories from a journalist of the time, Margarida Lacoque, has been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. The case continues to be actively investigated by some researchers, who receive information from military personnel and witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:57">[02:52:57]</a>. Efforts are made to protect the anonymity of sources who provide sensitive information, especially military personnel bound by confidentiality agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>.

Isabel Veloso, a 17-year-old (soon to be 18 in May) who has been undergoing cancer treatment for three years, recently shared her profound journey and perspective on life after learning she is a [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | palliative care]] patient with limited time left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. Alongside her fianc√©, Lucas, she is committed to fulfilling her dreams, including their upcoming wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

## Diagnosis and Early Challenges

Isabel's journey began at age 14 when she first experienced symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. Her initial symptom was a lump in her mediastinum, leading to severe shortness of breath and fluid accumulation in her lungs due to the tumor's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

Despite multiple doctor visits, her condition was initially misdiagnosed as gastritis or nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>. A turning point came when a doctor noticed her heart was displaced, pushed to the right side by the massive tumor that was 17x17x17 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>. She nearly fainted from shortness of breath and had 9.5 liters of fluid drained from her lung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:17:00">[32:17:00]</a>. This painful procedure was done with only local anesthesia, causing immense suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:44:00">[31:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>.

Her biopsy results were unusual, showing sarcoma cells instead of typical lymphoma, and her Hodgkin's lymphoma subtype was unclassifiable, making diagnosis and treatment more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:00">[33:03:00]</a>. She endured months of undiagnosed pain, sometimes praying for death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:05:00">[44:05:00]</a>.

## Treatment Journey

Isabel's treatment involved several intense phases:

*   **Chemotherapy**: Her first chemotherapy regimen almost reduced the tumor size, but its activity actually worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:26:00">[33:26:00]</a>. A three-day chemotherapy caused constant vomiting and extreme weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.
*   **Near-Death Experience**: During one chemotherapy session, Isabel had a profound near-death experience, seeing herself in a long, black tunnel with a light at the end, feeling an overwhelming sense of peace and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:02:00">[35:02:00]</a>. Two voices, one urging her to keep her eyes closed (representing comfort), and another, louder voice telling her to open them (representing life), led her back to consciousness, waking up vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:00">[35:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>.
*   **Immunotherapy**: The first treatment that showed significant progress was immunotherapy, which helps the immune system fight diseased cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:00">[36:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>. After five applications, she was practically clear of the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>.
*   **Bone Marrow Transplant**: Following immunotherapy, she underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (using her own cells) to enhance the treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29:00">[39:29:00]</a>. This involved a central access placement, six days of high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate existing marrow, and then infusing her frozen cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>. Side effects included a strong corn taste from preservatives and mucositis (wounds in the digestive system), requiring morphine and feeding bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:57:00">[41:57:00]</a>. After the transplant, she had to redo all childhood vaccinations as her immune system was reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:18:00">[44:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:33:00">[44:33:00]</a>.
*   **Recurrence and Palliative Care**: After completing immunotherapy in September last year, the cancer returned within a month and a half, presenting as a large lump in her neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:38:00">[46:38:00]</a>. Due to the severe side effects and lack of further curative options, Isabel decided to enter [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | palliative care]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:23:00">[50:23:00]</a>.

## Embracing Palliative Care and Quality of Life

Dr. Melina explained that [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | palliative care]] is about holistic care, addressing physical, emotional, spiritual, and social well-being, rather than solely focusing on the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[54:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:26:00">[54:26:00]</a>. The goal is to improve the patient's quality of life during their remaining time, regardless of its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:40:00">[56:40:00]</a>. Doctors generally avoid giving specific timeframes, as individual cases vary widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:08:00">[56:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20:00">[56:20:00]</a>. Isabel's tumor, while smaller, is still around her heart and could grow rapidly, leading to complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:01:00">[58:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:18:00">[58:18:00]</a>.

Isabel openly states that she is now living her best phase in [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | palliative care]], with reduced suffering and controlled pain through medication like patches stronger than morphine and cannabidiol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>.

## Personal and Public Impact

### Emotional and Spiritual Resilience

Isabel chose to accept her situation, reasoning that she wouldn't be unique in facing an incurable illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. She wrote a book titled "Despite the Pain, Gratitude," embodying her philosophy of choosing gratitude even in the face of immense suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. She believes her mission is not to be cured, but to "cure" others by sharing her story, teaching them to appreciate time and to live intensely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.

### Social Media and Public Perception

Isabel uses social media, particularly TikTok, as a therapeutic outlet to share her journey and vent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. However, she faces criticism from those who doubt her condition because she appears happy or posts about positive experiences. She had to share her medical reports to silence doubters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. Her openness also helps demystify [[Cancer Treatment and Palliative Care | palliative care]], showing it's not about giving up but about quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:27">[01:35:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a>.

## Love, Dreams, and Lasting Impact

Isabel and Lucas met at the gym, where he offered help when she struggled with an exercise machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. Their connection was instant, with shared past relationship struggles and spiritual beliefs about finding their person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. They decided early in their relationship that their intention was marriage and family, saving money for this dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. Upon learning of her incurable diagnosis, they launched a crowdfunding campaign for their wedding, which exceeded expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt:timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.

Isabel emphasizes living in the now and appreciating small moments, a lesson learned from her illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. Her biggest dreams were to marry and become a mother; though motherhood may not be possible, she is grateful to fulfill her dream of marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

Lucas, despite the pain of facing loss, remains steadfast, choosing to live their love story to the fullest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a>. Isabel's deepest fear is not death itself, but leaving behind those she loves, particularly Lucas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>. Her message to others is to not compare their journey, to enjoy every moment, and to find something to hold onto for strength, whether it's a loved one or a hobby like cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:24">[01:31:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>. She hopes people will "live for me, what I couldn't live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:23">[01:41:23]</a>.

Isabel's journey is a powerful testament to [[Overcoming personal challenges and resilience | resilience]], gratitude, and the profound impact of love in the face of terminal illness.

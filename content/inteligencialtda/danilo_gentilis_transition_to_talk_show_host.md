[[danilo_gentilis_career_and_challenges | Danilo Gentili]], known for his stand-up comedy and earlier work as a reporter, made a significant transition in his [[danilo_gentilis_career_and_challenges | career]] to become a talk show host, driven by a long-held desire for the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This shift was marked by his show "Agora é Tarde" on Band and its subsequent move to SBT.

## The Genesis of a Talk Show

[[danilo_gentilis_career_and_challenges | Danilo Gentili]] nurtured a desire to host a talk show, an idea he started researching in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. His earlier experiences, particularly as an "inexperienced reporter" on CQC, played a pivotal role in shaping his unique on-screen persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He consciously turned his initial discomfort and lack of experience into a comedic gag, which garnered positive attention and even influenced the Portuguese version of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

He envisioned a format that centered around conversations with interesting people, bringing in guests who were "smarter than me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. By 2009, he had already written a project for a talk show, outlining his vision, including specific team members like Murilo and Léo, and initially considering Rogério Morgado as the announcer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Negotiations at Band

[[danilo_gentilis_career_and_challenges | Gentili]] faced numerous obstacles during the development and launch of "Agora é Tarde" on Band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. He observed how the network initially ruined the "CQC" brand by introducing different bands and scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

When proposing "Agora é Tarde," the network was skeptical, arguing that a talk show wouldn't work on Band because it wasn't Globo, and they believed it wouldn't attract significant guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. There were also internal struggles regarding the team selection. Despite [[danilo_gentilis_career_and_challenges | Gentili's]] strong preference for Murilo, Léo, and Rogério Morgado, the production team insisted on tests, leading to considerations of other talents like PC Siqueira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

The show premiered with a low audience, but quickly saw a significant increase, jumping from 0.3 to 4.0 points overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This unexpected success led Band to expand it to a daily program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. However, the work environment remained challenging, with low budgets, limited resources, and constant stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. [[danilo_gentilis_career_and_challenges | Gentili]] felt he had to do "five times the work" of others due to the lean team and poor conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### Move to SBT and Vision for the Future

By the end of 2013, exhausted by the conditions at Band, [[danilo_gentilis_career_and_challenges | Gentili]] was approached by SBT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. His decision to move was heavily influenced by his commitment to his team. He informed his cast, including Juliana, Murilo, Léo, and others, that he would only go to SBT if everyone agreed to join him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. He confessed his insecurity about the change but prioritized the group's collective decision and the potential for better structure and audience at SBT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

Two key figures, the drummer Cod and the master, pressured him to make the move, believing it would lead to a bigger audience and better working conditions, including proper dressing rooms and parking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

Band attempted to retain him with a significant offer of half a million reais, but [[danilo_gentilis_career_and_challenges | Gentili]], driven by loyalty and his vision for the show, declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. He maintained that money was not his primary motivator, choosing to honor his team's decision to move to SBT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

At SBT, the new show, "The Noite," debuted with high ratings, reaching 6.0 points, quickly competing with Globo's audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This rapid success demonstrated the power of his vision and the team he assembled. [[danilo_gentilis_career_and_challenges | Gentili]] attributes his ability to overcome challenges to his faith and gratitude, stating that even when he felt he lost everything, he believed he had all he needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. His approach emphasizes non-confrontation in personal disputes, choosing to remove disloyal individuals from his life for practicality rather than revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

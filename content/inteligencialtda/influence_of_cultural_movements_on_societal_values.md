The "Limited Intelligence" program, hosted by Rogério Vilela, recently featured a discussion with Rina about global events and their connection to eschatology and the impact of cultural movements on societal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Eschatological Framework and the New World Order

The conversation began by exploring the rapid pace of global events, such as the war in Ukraine, the recent Israel-Palestine conflict, and volcanic eruptions, through an eschatological lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Rina introduced the theory of three prophesied world wars, as interpreted from the writings of ex-Satanist Doc Marx, who claimed to have insider knowledge of a long-term plan for a New World Order (NWO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This NWO would establish a single global government, currency, and religion, requiring centuries of work by an elite group with ramifications in all sectors of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

This plan operates on a thesis-antithesis-synthesis model, where opposing forces are created to ultimately lead to a desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### The First and Second World Wars

*   **First World War**: According to this interpretation, its objective was to overthrow the Tsarist Russian government, which resisted the implementation of a central bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The vision predicted the rise of a militaristic, atheist, and communist nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Lenin, the leader of the communist revolution, reportedly received financial support from the world's banking elite to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Second World War**: The aim was to strengthen this communist nation (the Soviet Union) into a superpower, capable of destroying other nations and religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The Soviet Union's history, marked by the severe persecution of all religions (Christian, Jewish, Orthodox), aligns with this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Marxism's atheistic premise posits that people should depend on the state, not God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### The Cold War and Societal Polarization

The end of World War II saw Russia emerge as a superpower, creating the "antithesis" to the "thesis" of capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This led to the Cold War, a period of global tension and polarization between communism and capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This intentional division aims to keep people arguing among themselves, unaware of a larger, subtle plan to usher in a new world order and the rule of the antichrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The current extreme polarization between political left and right is seen as a continuation of this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### The Third World War and its Spiritual Nature

Doc Marx's revelation, made in 1870 by Albert Pike (a prominent Freemason), predicted a third world war that would begin between Jews and Arabs/Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This prediction is alarming given the current conflict in Israel, as it was made when Israel was not yet a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. From the "chaos of this third war," a "super man" or leader would emerge to offer economic and social solutions, bringing peace and ending the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

This war is fundamentally spiritual, as its reasons are religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. Radical Islam believes Islam must be the world's only religion, leading to the persecution of "infidels" (Jews, Christians) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. While only 15-20% of Muslims are considered extremist, this still accounts for an estimated 320 million people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

## Cultural and Religious Transformations through Demographics

Islam is noted as the fastest-growing religion globally due to high fertility rates and immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This demographic shift is seen as a strategy to transform cultures and has led to the "Islamization" of traditionally Christian countries in Europe, as their lower birth rates make them susceptible to cultural erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. This raises concerns about the future of religious tolerance if extremist views prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

## The 1968 Revolution: A Turning Point

The 1968 student-led protest movement, which quickly gained momentum with leftist and communist leaders, is identified as a decisive cultural transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:54">[01:56:54]</a>. This global phenomenon, which influenced movements in Brazil and other parts of the world, marked a "gradual degradation of morals" and a shift in [[cultural_and_societal_changes_influencing_religious_celebrations | Western spiritual]] values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">[01:57:38]</a>.

Prior to 1968, Christian values were part of society's consensus; afterward, they were increasingly rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:55">[02:00:55]</a>. Key events of this era included:
*   Protests against the Vietnam War, another manifestation of the capitalism vs. communism "thesis-antithesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:01">[02:03:01]</a>.
*   The Prague Spring, which put the "socialist cultural revolution" (Menshevik approach of infiltrating institutions rather than armed revolt) into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:36">[01:58:36]</a>.
*   The assassination of Martin Luther King and the rise of black civil rights struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:27">[01:59:27]</a>.
*   The premiere of the musical "Hair," which featured nudity and challenged traditional moral boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.

### Counterculture and its Instruments

The Woodstock festival in 1969 became a symbol of this countercultural era and the "Age of Aquarius," signaling the end of one era and the beginning of a new one characterized by mysticism and new entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>.

The counterculture adopted various forms of protest, including:
*   **Drug Use**: Influencers like Harvard professor Timothy Leary promoted LSD and other synthetic drugs as a way to "perceive the world in a better way" and "expand the mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This led to millions of young people succumbing to drug addiction, with long-term societal consequences like "Cracolândia" (crackland) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:40">[02:04:40]</a>.
*   **Sexual Revolution**: Driven by the motto "Make love, not war," this movement led to a "sexual moral degradation," transforming sex from a sacred bond into depravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:19">[02:05:19]</a>.

### The Frankfurt School and Cultural Marxism

Herbert Marcuse, a philosopher associated with the Frankfurt School, was instrumental in this [[cultural_and_political_dynamics | cultural revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:55">[02:05:55]</a>. The Frankfurt School's aim was to destroy Western culture, capitalism, and the religious dimension of life by infiltrating institutions like the state, media, and education, rather than through armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>. This approach of cultural Marxism is seen as the reason why many university students, even from privileged backgrounds, advocate for communism and socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>.

Marcuse realized that American proletarians were generally content and would not rebel against capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:28">[02:07:28]</a>. Therefore, he proposed using "outsiders" – students, artists, intellectuals, and influencers – as transforming agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:01">[02:08:01]</a>.

### Popular Culture as a Tool for Transformation

Art, cinema, music, theater, and literature were identified as powerful instruments for social transformation and the propagation of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:37">[02:08:37]</a>.
*   **Music**:
    *   The Beatles, particularly John Lennon, became an "incarnation of socialist ideas" through songs like "Imagine," which described a New World Order without borders or religion, subconsciously influencing a generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:28">[02:12:28]</a>.
    *   The Punk movement (e.g., Sex Pistols, Dead Kennedys) expressed pessimism, revolt, and hatred for bourgeois and capitalist values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:57">[02:16:57]</a>. Songs like "Holiday in Cambodia" by Dead Kennedys openly spoke about communist leaders and their atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:51">[02:17:51]</a>.
    *   Heavy metal bands (e.g., Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden) introduced Satanism, breaking traditional paradigms and making "satanic cults" more accessible to young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:31">[02:21:31]</a>.
    *   The song "Old Santa Claus Batuta" promoted anti-capitalist sentiment, aligning with the thesis-antithesis of communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:05">[02:19:05]</a>.
    *   Songs also instilled the communist idea that "wealth is fixed," encouraging people to fight for their share rather than generating it through work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:08">[02:20:08]</a>. This notion is blamed for the historical failure of communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:26">[02:20:26]</a>.
*   **Predictive Programming**: This theory suggests that media (drawings, books, theater, cinema, music) is used to "advertise future events" and subtly condition people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>. Examples include Thanos in *The Avengers* promoting population reduction, and *The Simpsons* allegedly making predictions that align with a pre-planned agenda, demonstrating control to their followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:31">[02:09:31]</a>. This aims to lead people to unconsciously accept concepts like population reduction "for the good of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:40">[02:10:40]</a>.

## Societal Consequences and the Spiritual Perspective

These [[impact_of_culture_and_technology_on_human_behavior | cultural shifts]] have led to:
*   A rise in wickedness and contempt for God's laws (iniquity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a>.
*   A cooling of love among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>.
*   The breakdown of traditional family structures, with Engels' theory that social inequality began with the family, leading to efforts to dismantle it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   An "epidemic of sadness," chronic depression, and anxiety, despite increased access to technology and material goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:16">[02:23:16]</a>. This is seen as proof that material satisfaction does not bring peace of mind and that humans are created with a need for connection with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:29">[02:23:29]</a>.

From a spiritual perspective, these programmed catastrophes (earthquakes, hurricanes, famine, pandemics, nuclear war) are designed to coincide with the beginning of the third world war, creating chaos that the antichrist will exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. The ability to manipulate weather through technology is suggested as a means for these engineered catastrophes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:17">[02:31:17]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that these alarming events signal the nearness of the end times, urging listeners to seek God, repent, and believe in Jesus Christ for eternal and abundant life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:40">[02:31:40]</a>.

American actor Vincent Martella, widely recognized for his role as Greg Wuliger in the television series *Everybody Hates Chris*, visited Brazil to a significant public reception and engaged in various cultural experiences and fan interactions during his stay.

## Arrival and Initial Impressions
Martella's visit was highly anticipated by Brazilian fans, who had actively campaigned for his presence [00:06:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The sheer scale of the attention, which saw his social media followers jump from 200,000 to 6 million, was unexpected by him [00:07:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. He expressed excitement and appreciation for the space he was in [00:07:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Despite a busy schedule filled with appointments, Martella noted that he hadn't yet had much time to fully explore Brazil, its music, or its food [00:09:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. He had, however, tried some snacks earlier on the day of the interview [00:09:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Interactions with Fans and Brazilian Culture
Martella observed a distinct cultural difference in Brazil regarding physical interaction; while Americans are "not very touchy" or "hugging," Brazilians tend to hug and kiss more [00:10:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. He confirmed that he felt a lot of people hugging him, though he joked about potentially being held "like a baby" later [00:10:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. His friendliness and the way he reciprocated the affection from the Brazilian public were widely commented upon [00:10:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

He expressed gratitude for the support from his fans, acknowledging that their support is crucial for his career [00:15:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Martella finds it "amazing" that his work from *Everybody Hates Chris* or *Phineas and Ferb* is now being shown by adult fans to their children [00:15:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. He sees his work as creating "emotional memory" for people, shaping their character, and becoming a part of their lives [01:04:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.

He was surprised by the highly specific and sometimes confusing references Brazilian fans make online, such as the "danger shirt" meme [00:50:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. He learned that the phrase "Ela tá tão na sua" (She's so into you), originating from the series, has become a very common idiom in Brazil, used in various contexts beyond romantic relationships [00:51:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

Martella also learned about and received a jersey from Ponte Preta, a Brazilian football team, acknowledging the popular meme of his character Greg wearing its jersey [00:31:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. He expressed amusement at becoming a meme [00:33:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>).

Other actors, like Andrew McFarlin (Tony from *My Wife and Kids*), have also tried to connect with Brazilian fans by getting tattoos or posting photos similar to Martella's, which he found "funny" and noted as the start of a "trend" [01:32:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>. He even acknowledged a comparison between himself and Brazilian goalkeeper Cácio [01:30:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>).

## Culinary Experiences
During his visit, Martella was offered and tried several typical Brazilian foods:
*   **Coxinha**: He noted he had tried it earlier and found it "very good" [01:11:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. He later enjoyed a coxinha with catupiri cheese and olive [01:19:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>).
*   **Pão de Queijo (Cheese Bread)**: He hadn't tried this before being offered it during the interview [01:12:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>.
*   **Pernil sandwich**: Mentioned as an option, but not confirmed if tried [01:13:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Caipirinha**: He was set to try this Brazilian cocktail, made with *pinga* (cachaça) [01:14:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. He later tried a strawberry caipirinha [01:54:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:41">[01:54:41]</a>).
*   **Bolovo**: Described as a meatloaf with an egg inside, fried [01:12:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. He couldn't try it due to an egg allergy [01:12:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>).
*   **Brigadeiro**: He had tried this Brazilian chocolate sweet the night before and found it "very good" [01:34:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a>.
*   **Carolina**: Described as a shell with chocolate on top and *dulce de leche* inside [01:34:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>. He preferred this over brigadeiro [01:35:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:15">[01:35:15]</a>.
*   **Açaí**: Offered to him at the end of the interview [01:43:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>.

## Future Plans in Brazil
Martella confirmed he would return to Brazil in July 2024 for "Imagine Land" in João Pessoa, a convention where he looks forward to meeting many fans directly on the beach [00:9:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:9:31">[00:9:31]</a>, [01:43:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:35">[01:43:35]</a>). He also expressed a desire to travel more within Brazil to see more of the country [00:9:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:9:25">[00:9:25]</a>. He stated his eagerness to return and make more friends in Brazil, finding it cool to meet other comedians and creative people [01:22:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>.

From: [[inteligencialtda]] <br/> 

Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, have become battlegrounds for public opinion, often leading to personal attacks and "cancel culture" incidents. Users report that online interactions can be toxic, addictive, and create situations where opinions are easily distorted and weaponized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>.

## Personal Experiences with Online Attacks

The speaker has experienced significant online backlash and [[impact_of_political_correctness_and_cancel_culture_on_comedy | cancel culture]] incidents, often stemming from misinterpretations of his words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

*   **Twitter Account Hacking**
    On one occasion, his Twitter account was hacked, an event that occurred around his birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. This incident led to his account being "canceled" or locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. He later managed to regain access, only to find many "buggy" elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:27">[02:51:27]</a>.

*   **Misinterpreted Jokes and Police Notification**
    After returning from the United States, the speaker received a notification to appear at a police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>. This was due to someone being upset about a joke he made that they associated with mocking religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:57">[01:46:57]</a>. Despite explaining the situation, the police delegate struggled to understand that "Darkside" was a DC Comics villain and not a religious figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.

*   **"Kick the Dog" Controversy**
    A recent news story on G1 about a robber who "petted" a dog led the speaker to express his opinion that the robber likely did so out of fear of being caught, not genuine affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>. This comment was taken out of context on Twitter, leading to widespread accusations that he wanted people to "kick the dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:58">[01:34:58]</a>. The online mob distorted his words, inventing accusations and creating a viral narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

*   **Harley Quinn Movie Review Backlash**
    His review of the Harley Quinn movie, where he stated it "could be better" but not "bad," was distorted on Twitter, leading to accusations of sexism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. Similarly, his review of Captain Marvel was used to claim he disliked "gay kisses," a complete fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:32">[01:58:32]</a>.

*   **"Android 17 Myth" Controversy**
    A tweet about Android 17 being a "myth" was misinterpreted as an association with a political figure, leading to further attacks, despite the speaker's political neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:02">[01:45:02]</a>.

### Motivations Behind Online Attacks
The speaker believes that many attempts to "cancel" individuals are fueled by envy or competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>. He suggests that those who are content with their own lives are less likely to try to bring others down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:14">[01:38:14]</a>.

## The Nature of Online Discourse
The speaker characterizes Twitter as a "toxic and addictive network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:48">[02:51:48]</a>, distinct from platforms like Instagram or TikTok which he sees as more "love-filled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. Facebook, while having discussions, doesn't exhibit the same level of hate as Twitter, which he describes as "free war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>.

### Challenges of Online Communication
*   **Character Limits and Editing:** Twitter's character limits and lack of an edit button contribute to miscommunication. Users may post quickly without fully thinking, and then cannot rectify misinterpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:54">[02:52:54]</a>.
*   **Inability to Apologize:** The culture on some platforms makes it difficult for individuals to genuinely apologize or express regret, as it can be perceived as a sign of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. This often traps individuals in a cycle of negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Echo Chambers and Bubbles:** Online communities tend to operate in "bubbles," where information is shared and reinforced, often without proper context or nuance. When an opinion is perceived to contradict a group's narrative, it can trigger an attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:55">[01:38:55]</a>.
*   **Conspiracy Theories:** The speaker notes that online communities often generate elaborate conspiracy theories to explain events or statements, filling "frames" with their own interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Personal Connection:** Online interactions lack the depth of face-to-face conversations. A short tweet cannot convey the full complexity of a person or their intentions, leading to superficial judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:27">[02:56:27]</a>.

## Coping with Online Negativity
The speaker emphasizes that engaging with online negativity is often unproductive. He advises against responding to every criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:36">[02:22:36]</a> and suggests that blocking and muting are effective tools for managing negative interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:15">[02:54:15]</a>. He maintains that true "cancellation" only occurs when it genuinely harms a person's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>, noting that many online attacks only serve to "inflame your own bubble" and sometimes even attract new audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>.

The speaker highlights the importance of consistency in content creation. Changing content type too abruptly, like shifting from comedy to travel vlogging, can cause a channel's audience to plummet, as the algorithm stops recommending content that no longer aligns with what the audience initially sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:47">[03:06:47]</a>. Reclaiming that space requires a fierce strategy and rebuilding trust with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:58">[03:07:58]</a>.

## Growth and Evolution in the Digital Space
The speaker, a content creator, has witnessed the evolution of the internet and social media, from early emulation websites in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:56">[02:21:56]</a> to the rise of social networks. He recalls a time when "webmasters" were common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:27">[02:42:27]</a> and websites were the primary means of online interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

He created several successful platforms, including a music lyrics website (letras.com.br) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>, which became a significant financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>. He adapted to changing trends, recognizing the shift from blogs to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. His approach to content creation emphasizes continuous improvement based on audience feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

He attributes his success to being an "anti-fragile learner" who embraces challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>, even when facing significant setbacks like website hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:50">[02:42:50]</a> or database loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:08">[02:49:08]</a>. He believes that the digital marketing landscape today offers more resources and opportunities than in the past, despite increased competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:02">[02:27:02]</a>.

The speaker believes that in the long term, online content will persist, leaving a lasting digital legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. He hopes to be remembered for making a difference and helping people through his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:29">[03:15:29]</a>.

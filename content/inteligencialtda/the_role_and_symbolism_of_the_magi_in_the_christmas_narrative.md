The Magi, often referred to as "wise men" in biblical texts, play a significant role in the Christmas narrative, bringing gifts and offering worship to the newborn [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]]. Their journey and offerings are rich with [[Symbolism in the Book of Revelation | symbolism]] that highlights aspects of Jesus' identity and mission.

## Identity of the Magi
Contrary to popular belief, the Magi were not kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. The Bible does not refer to them as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>. Instead, they were Zoroastrian astrologers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:8:26">[02:8:26]</a>. In their time, [[The role of astrology and mysticism in military strategies | astronomy]] and astrology were intertwined sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>. The Greek word "Magos," translated as "Magi," signifies wise men who sought knowledge through the sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:42">[02:49:42]</a>. Their knowledge likely stemmed from ancient prophecies, including those of Daniel and Balaam, which spoke of a star appearing with the great king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:19">[03:00:19]</a>.

## Their Journey and Timing
The Magi followed a bright light, which was a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, occurring around six years Before Christ (BC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a>. This astrological event indicated the birth of the "King of Judea," a title associated with Jupiter in Greek literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:08">[02:28:08]</a>. They arrived in Jerusalem approximately two years after Jesus' birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

Upon arrival, they inquired of King Herod about the newborn king, leading to Herod's fury and his subsequent order to kill all male children up to two years old in Bethlehem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:33">[02:33:33]</a>. However, the Magi were divinely warned not to return to Herod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. This event led Joseph to flee with Mary and Jesus to Egypt, where they remained until Herod's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a>.

## Symbolic Gifts
The gifts brought by the Magi — gold, frankincense, and myrrh — were not random, but deeply symbolic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>:
*   **Gold**: Symbolized [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]]' royalty and kingship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:42">[03:47:42]</a>.
*   **Frankincense (Incense)**: Represented his role as an intercessor and deity, signifying his spiritual nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:10">[03:49:10]</a>.
*   **Myrrh**: A costly and bitter-smelling perfume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:56">[04:51:56]</a>. It symbolized [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]]' future death and embalming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:56">[04:53:56]</a>. Myrrh is extracted from a thorny tree through a painful process of cutting the bark and squeezing the sap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:47">[04:41:47]</a>. This gift prophetically foreshadowed Jesus' sacrificial death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:56">[04:55:56]</a>.

These valuable gifts also served a practical purpose, providing funds for Joseph and Mary to live for two years in Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.

## Significance of Their Visit
The Magi's visit underscores several key themes:
*   **Divine Revelation Beyond Israel**: The Magi, being from the East (Babylon), were outsiders to Israelite [[Role and interpretation of biblical prophecies | prophecy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:19">[03:00:19]</a>. Their pursuit of [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] based on astrological signs demonstrates God's ability to reveal Himself through various means to those who sincerely seek the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:24">[05:44:24]</a>.
*   **Contrast with Religious Leaders**: Unlike the Magi, many Jewish religious leaders of the time, who had direct access to the prophecies regarding the Messiah's birth in Bethlehem, failed to recognize or believe in Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:05">[04:35:05]</a>. This highlights that true faith and recognition of God can come from unexpected sources.
*   **Universal Worship**: The presence of both humble shepherds and wealthy Magi at Jesus' birth demonstrates that worship of God transcends social status, showing that anyone, regardless of their condition, can approach and worship God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:30">[05:59:30]</a>.

The Magi's actions confirm [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]]' identity as King, High Priest, and ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling [[Role and interpretation of biblical prophecies | biblical prophecies]] and setting the stage for his redemptive work.

Jair Bolsonaro's political career and presidency have been marked by numerous controversies and criticisms, both from his political opponents and the general public. These criticisms span his early political life, his stance on public policies, his government's actions, and his personal statements.

## Early Political Career and Opposition

Before becoming president, [[Jair Bolsonaros political career and presidency|Jair Bolsonaro]] served as a federal deputy for 28 years and a councilor for two years [00:26:41]. His entry into politics began after he made a statement in a magazine in 1986 as an active military man, which resulted in a disciplinary transgression [00:25:36]. This incident propelled him into politics [00:25:38].

Upon entering Parliament in 1991, he noted a strong anti-military sentiment [00:27:58]. He encountered "dozens of amnestied ex-guerrillas" who he believed saw him as "fresh meat" [00:28:03]. He states that he was "processed all the time" and faced around 20 "shark processes" for "talking too much," accused of being "antidemocratic" and attacking the state [00:28:54]. He countered by stating that left-wing individuals who had trained in countries like Cuba would accuse those who were different [00:29:27].

He often acted as a "counterpoint" within Parliament, frequently discussing the military period [00:30:05]. He notably referred to the Truth Commission as a "commission of lies" because he believed its "truth" was ideological [00:29:38].

## Criticisms During Presidency

### Pandemic Management

Bolsonaro admits to some self-criticism regarding his words during the COVID-19 pandemic, stating, "a few words mine that I don't want to solve indignation I went too far" [01:03:45]. He believes the opposition, however, would not reciprocate self-criticism and would instead "morally lynch" him [01:03:56].

He consistently opposed broad lockdown measures, advocating for only the elderly and those with comorbidities to isolate [01:07:09]. He argued that a "policy of not working would die many more people" due to economic collapse [01:07:23]. He also criticized the negative psychological impacts, noting increased rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide linked to "stay at home" policies [01:07:32]. He was against closing schools, which he claims led some to accuse him of wanting to "kill a child" or "kill student" [01:07:48].

Regarding vaccine procurement, Bolsonaro states that no country had vaccines to sell in 2020 [01:08:47]. He specifically cited Pfizer's initial proposal, which he claims offered no delivery commitment and no responsibility for side effects [01:10:05]. He defended his controversial comment about the vaccine potentially turning people into "alligators" as a "figure of speech" misinterpreted by the opposition to mock him [01:10:23]. He emphasizes Brazil's strong vaccination tradition, but questions the efficacy of new vaccines in preventing transmission, noting that Pfizer's own director stated no tests were done to confirm this [01:13:56].

He also claims a "war" was waged against his government by figures like former São Paulo Governor João Doria, who "occupied two hours of television" claiming to buy vaccines that were actually procured by the federal government [01:12:06]. Bolsonaro argues that his administration "garroted" official government advertising expenses, leading to negative press coverage [01:12:40].

### Economic and Social Policies

Bolsonaro's government has faced criticism regarding its [[public_policies_and_socioeconomic_issues_in_brazil|economic and social policies]].

#### Secret Budget
A major point of contention has been the "secret budget," which allocates approximately R$15 billion per year to Parliament (Chamber and Senate) through "rapporteur's amendments" [01:33:16]. Bolsonaro claims he vetoed this budget, but his veto was overturned by Congress, with the entire PT (Workers' Party) bench voting to overturn it [01:33:35]. He argues it's "secret" because the names of the parliamentarians who request the funds are not publicly disclosed [01:35:10]. He vehemently denies that this budget is used to "buy votes," pointing out that 13 PT deputies received resources from it despite never voting with his government [01:36:27].

#### Social Assistance
Bolsonaro refutes claims of widespread hunger in Brazil, stating that those living in "poverty" (earning up to $1.9 per day) only number about 1.5 million people [01:28:40]. He highlights his administration's Auxílio Brasil program, which pays R$600 per month (R$20 per day), more than triple the average of the previous Bolsa Família program [01:29:06]. He notes that the PT voted against the permanent R$400 payment and that his government plans a real increase in the minimum wage and for public servants [01:30:24].

#### Law Rouanet (Cultural Incentive Law)
Bolsonaro implemented changes to the Law Rouanet, a cultural incentive law, which led to the "artistic cream of Brazil" turning against him [01:49:30]. He states that the law, which involved R$1 billion per year in tax waivers for sponsored cultural projects, was prone to abuse, with some individuals receiving up to R$10 million annually [01:48:30]. He clarifies that the law was intended to support new artists but was instead being used by established names [01:49:19].

### Personal Accusations and Scandals

Bolsonaro has been subject to various personal accusations and scandals.

#### "Rachadinha" (Split Scheme) Allegations
He addresses the "rachadinha" (split scheme) allegations against his son, Flávio, by comparing it to the "Mais Médicos" (More Doctors) program under the PT government, where Cuban doctors allegedly had R$9,500 of their R$12,000 monthly salary diverted to the Cuban dictatorship [02:25:07]. He asserts that his son is "responsible for his actions" and that federal police never investigated his children or him, as it was a matter for the Public Ministry [02:30:53].

#### Real Estate Purchases
Accusations about his family's purchase of "50 and a few" properties, many allegedly bought with "cash," were dismissed by Bolsonaro as a "lie" and an "evil" interpretation [01:45:17]. He states that "currency current" on property deeds can refer to various forms of payment, not just physical cash [01:45:29]. He points out that his family members have legitimate businesses and that their properties were acquired over 32 years, with his first property bought in 1990 [01:47:51]. He also highlights that a 2017 investigation by then-Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot found no "minimum signs" to proceed with allegations of irregular purchases [01:46:05].

#### "Cannibalism" Comment
Bolsonaro addresses a controversial comment about cannibalism, explaining it was about a 30-year-old experience in an indigenous reserve where the local tradition involved cooking and eating parts of a deceased young Indian [02:16:54]. He states that some people "wanted to see the ritual," and he said, "If everyone wants I will go" [02:17:22]. He dismisses the criticism as a misrepresentation of a past cultural encounter.

#### "Chick Climate" Comment
He clarified a comment about "chick climate" during a live broadcast in a community in Roraima, stating that he saw girls preparing for an event and a "mood arose," which he meant as a general atmosphere [02:14:45]. He emphasizes that he had over 20 security personnel with him and was discussing a serious environmental decree, not disrespecting the girls [02:15:59]. He also points out that the girls were Venezuelan immigrants "earning a life" after fleeing their country [02:14:57].

#### Reduction of Criminal Responsibility Age
Bolsonaro has always advocated for reducing the age of criminal responsibility, arguing that 16 or 17-year-olds who commit serious crimes like murder or cell phone theft "knowing of impunity" should face consequences [02:18:14]. He believes this would teach them that "doing evil will have a price to pay" [02:18:37].

### Media Relations and "Fake News"

Bolsonaro frequently criticizes the traditional media, accusing them of spreading "fake news" and lacking credibility. He states that he does not need to create fake news against his opponents because "he will tell the truth" [01:39:18]. He argues that major newspapers and television stations have lost audience by taking political sides and focusing only on "bad news" [01:41:14].

He expresses concern about judicial decisions, such as those by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), that impose "prior censorship," which he views as "dangerous" [01:39:48]. He specifically mentions the censorship against Jovem Pan and other channels [01:39:58]. He believes that the public is capable of differentiating between truth and lies without censorship [01:41:02].

He contrasts himself with his main opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, by highlighting Lula's past statements on abortion and drug legalization, which he believes Lula now denies for "political electoral" reasons [01:55:29]. Bolsonaro asserts that he himself has changed views, notably moving from a statist and nationalizing stance to supporting privatizations after realizing the "bloated state does not work" [01:57:25]. He states that Lula has a history of lying in politics, citing a previous statement where Lula admitted to exaggerating the number of abandoned children in Brazil [01:56:34].

He also addresses allegations of racism and homophobia, stating he does not dislike "northeastern" people, as his wife is the daughter of one, nor "black people," as his father-in-law is "a mixture of black and Indian" [02:48:10]. He cites saving a black man from drowning as an example of his character [02:48:35]. He denies persecuting gay individuals, claiming that the number of deaths of gay people decreased under his government [02:50:29].

## Relations with Other Political Figures

Bolsonaro acknowledges reconciling with former Justice Minister Sergio Moro, stating they have "put aside differences" for the "common good," as they both view [[Comparison of Jair Bolsonaro and Lula da Silva|Lula]] as the "worst" option for Brazil [02:12:54]. He recognizes that Moro will have an "independent performance" in the Senate but will work on fighting corruption [02:13:31].

He discusses his relationship with former Minister Abraham Weintraub, acknowledging that Weintraub had a "good job" but left Brazil out of "concern about being arrested" after making comments against the Supreme Court [02:32:00]. Bolsonaro distances himself from Weintraub's subsequent political endeavors, noting that they failed to gain significant support [02:32:34].

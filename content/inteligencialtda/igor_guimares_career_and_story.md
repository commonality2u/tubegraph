Igor Guimarães, also known as "Guinho," is a Brazilian comedian, known for his unique humor, improvisational skills, and memorable characters. The host of the podcast describes him as a "great imitator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> and someone who can still make people laugh in a world where much of the humor is text-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Early Life and Education

Guimarães grew up in a Catholic family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a> and attended schools run by priests and friars, including São José dos Padres de Sião and Colégio Maria Imaculada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. He later went to GV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>, a renowned school. He completed a technical course in environmental science, stating he could "plant a tree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a> if needed. He also has a bachelor's degree in journalism and worked as an art director in an agency, although he felt his college education was outdated compared to his practical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>.

## Comedy Career

Igor Guimarães's comedic journey began over 11 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. Initially, he attempted classic stand-up comedy, but it didn't go well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. He described an early joke: "People, there is a stool here," which received no laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. After two unsuccessful shows, he decided to "say what I want to say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>, which led to his unique style. He often uses high-pitched, schizophrenic voices and screams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

### Characters and Impersonations
Igor Guimarães is known for his array of characters and impersonations. Among his most famous are:
*   **Josias puppet:** A puppet character created for the show *Pânico* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. It was an instant hit due to its mix of light and heavy humor, touching on dark themes like organ theft with a childlike voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.
*   **Lawyer Paloma:** Another character he developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.
*   **Indiana Jones (Indian character):** He created an Indian character for *Pânico* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.
*   **Dinho:** A character with an instantly recognizable voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

He notes that the audience often asks him to do his Alok impersonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

### Show Format and Experiences
Igor Guimarães prefers not to do solo shows, as he finds it difficult to talk for an hour alone and believes the audience has a better experience with multiple comedians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. His solo shows often involve a mix of characters, where he would quickly change costumes and makeup backstage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. He would also incorporate pre-recorded videos to allow time for costume changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

He has performed in various unusual places:
*   A "cultural turnaround" at 3 or 4 AM with very few people present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.
*   A venue where a dance was happening on the first floor and his show was on the second, right after an accordion player's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
*   Allianz Parque with a giant drum set in front of the stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
*   A TCC (final project) presentation for a gastronomy course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.
*   Weddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.

He recalls a show in the East Zone where a child threw rocks at him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. He also mentions an instance where a woman threw leaves at him at a show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a> and police closing down shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>.

He believes his visibility and presence as an artist is a form of activism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>, and that coexistence is the best form of activism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

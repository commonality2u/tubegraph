The concept of the Trinity is described as one of the mysteries of God that can be understood, though not in its full depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The Bible teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. They are three distinct persons within one God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Jesus' Pre-existence and Divine Nature

[[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] (Jesus) existed as eternal God before His birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. He is referred to as the "Word" or "Logos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. John 1 states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This "Word" is the very essence and action of [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. All things were made through Him, meaning nothing in creation was made without Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] is considered the architect, who conceived creation, while [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] (the Word) executed it, and the Holy Spirit supervised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

In Genesis, the Hebrew word for God, "Elohim," is plural, and when [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] speaks of creating humankind, He says, "Let us make man in our image and likeness," indicating the involvement of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]], before incarnating, was [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] the Son, eternally with [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]], and was never created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Orthodoxy holds that the Son is [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] just as much as the Father and the Holy Spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Pre-Incarnation Manifestations

Before His incarnation, [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] already existed and often appeared as a "messenger of Yahweh," or the "angel of the Lord" in the Old Testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Unlike created angels, the "angel of the Lord" is not created and accepts adoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Examples include the burning bush encounter with Moses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> and the apparition to Joshua before the battle of Jericho, where He identified Himself as the "captain of the armies of the Most High" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Hebrews Chapter 1 states that [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] spoke through prophets in the past but spoke to humanity through the Son in the last days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] is the exact manifestation and expression of [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]]'s being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. When Philip asked [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] to show them the Father, [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] replied, "Whoever sees me sees the Father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### The Mystery of Unity and Plurality

The statement "I and the Father are one" confused many Jews, who thought it implied polytheism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. However, the word "one" in the context of the Trinity refers to a unity that can be plural, meaning [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] is one with the Father and the Holy Spirit, but they are different persons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This is a mystery beyond complete human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

An analogy used to explain the Trinity is water, which exists in solid, liquid, and gaseous states but remains H2O, the same water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Similarly, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are manifestations of the same person in three different ways, not three different gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. They are three persons in one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Jesus' Role in Creation

In Genesis 1, when [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] created the heavens and the earth, [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] the Father gave the command, but the one who executed it was the Word (Jesus), and the Spirit of [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] was over the waters (Holy Spirit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Thus, the Father, Son, and Spirit acted together in creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. While [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] is also the "light of the world," the "light" in "Let there be light" cannot be [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] as [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] was not created but already existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Jesus' Incarnation: An Eternal Plan

[[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]]'s incarnation was not a reactive plan due to humanity's fall, but was decided in eternity, at the foundation of the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]]'s "Plan A" was always [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]], and the sovereign [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] knew that humanity would fall and need a Redeemer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

Revelation 13:8 speaks of "the Lamb that was slain since the foundation of the world," indicating that [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]]'s death, though happening at a specific time in the physical world, was already predetermined in eternity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This sacrifice was an expression of [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]]'s incomprehensible, unconditional love for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

### The Virgin Birth and Sinlessness

[[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] had to be born of a virgin because sin is transmitted through man, not woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:19">[02:06:19]</a>. The Bible states that "through one man sin entered the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:32">[02:06:32]</a>. This is because [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]]'s direct command not to eat from the tree was given to Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:40">[02:06:40]</a>. Therefore, [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] could have a human mother but not a human father, ensuring he was without sin, though tempted, he resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:04">[02:07:04]</a>. This fulfilled the prophecy in Isaiah 7:14, which states, "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>.

## Role of Grace and Salvation

[[Soteriology and theological interpretations | Salvation]] comes through [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]], who became a perfect sacrifice for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. The Bible teaches that sin is the transgression of [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]]'s Law, leading to spiritual death and separation from [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]]'s death was necessary because "without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. The blood of animals only covered sins (as seen in Yom Kippur), but the blood of [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] destroys sins, making believers whiter than snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. The book of Hebrews states that [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] died "once and for all" for sins, making further sacrifices unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.

Grace is an undeserved favor, and it is personified as [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] Himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:21">[02:09:21]</a>. The law came through Moses, but grace and truth came through [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus Christ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:36">[02:09:36]</a>. While believers may still sin, being close to [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] through [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] provides strength to overcome temptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:27">[02:10:27]</a>. [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] died to free humanity from the condemnation of sin, and while sin may still manifest, believers are free from its power and will ultimately be free from its presence in eternity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:25">[02:13:25]</a>.

## The Second Coming of Christ

[[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] promises to return, and this "second coming" is a central aspect of Christian belief, with approximately 40% of the Bible's prophetic aspect dedicated to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>. This is distinct from the rapture of the church, which occurs before the second coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:05">[01:48:05]</a>. The rapture is described as invisible, where the church ascends to meet the Lord in the air, while the second coming will be visible to every eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>. Between these two events will be the Great Tribulation, a period involving the [[Theological Discussion on Antichrist | Antichrist]] and a "Satanic Trinity" (Satan, [[Theological Discussion on Antichrist | Antichrist]], and False Prophet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:35">[01:49:35]</a>.

[[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]]'s return will establish judgment and lead to a thousand-year reign on Earth, known as the Millennium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:58">[02:04:58]</a>. In the first coming, He was the Lamb; in the second, He will be the Lion, the judge of the earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:38">[02:03:38]</a>. The Millennium will be a period of peace, prosperity, and reduced sin, with [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]] present and Satan imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:24">[02:17:24]</a>. After the Millennium, Satan will be released for a final test, after which a final judgment will separate those who chose [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]] eternally from those who did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:16">[02:19:16]</a>.

### Signs of the Times

[[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]] spoke of various signs preceding His return, including natural disasters (fires, earthquakes, floods), geopolitical conflicts, and apostasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>. These signs are said to be increasing in intensity, similar to labor pains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:59">[01:51:59]</a>. Prophecies like the Dead Sea becoming fresh and fish swimming in it, and the return of the Jewish people to Israel from all nations, have been fulfilled, pointing to the nearness of [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Christ]]'s return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:52">[01:36:52]</a>.

# Conclusion

The [[Theological Debates on the Nature of Jesus and the Trinity | Trinity]] is central to understanding [[Jesus and His Role in Salvation | Jesus]]'s identity as eternal [[Faith spirituality and the existence of God | God]], His role in creation and [[Soteriology and theological interpretations | salvation]], and His future return to establish His kingdom. It is a mystery of divine unity in three distinct persons, all working in perfect synergy.

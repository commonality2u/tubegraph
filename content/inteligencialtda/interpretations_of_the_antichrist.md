The **Antichrist** is a central figure in [[Interpretations of Revelation | biblical prophecy]], particularly within the Book of Revelation. Interpretations of the Antichrist vary widely among theologians, aligning with different approaches to understanding [[interpretations_of_biblical_prophecy_and_the_end_times | biblical prophecies]] and [[different_interpretations_of_eschatology_and_end_times | eschatology]].

### Interpretations of the Antichrist

The discussion on the Antichrist is deeply intertwined with how the Book of Revelation is interpreted. There are at least four main schools of thought regarding the Antichrist and the fulfillment of apocalyptic prophecies:

1.  **Preterist Interpretation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>:
    *   Proponents believe that prophecies of the Apocalypse, including those concerning the Beast (often associated with the Antichrist), were entirely fulfilled in the first century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
    *   Many Catholic theologians, for instance, interpret the Beast as referring to the Roman Empire and figures like Emperor Nero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:10">[02:10:10]</a>, implying there is nothing future to happen regarding these prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>.
    *   This view suggests the Antichrist cannot be the Pope because the Antichrist, as per John's letter, denies Jesus came in the flesh, which the Pope does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:15">[02:54:15]</a>.

2.  **Futurist Interpretation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>:
    *   This view holds that 90% of the Apocalypse refers to future eschatological events and the end times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>.
    *   During the Cold War, some dispensationalist futurists identified the Antichrist with Russia and the Soviet Union, demonizing communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:29">[02:53:29]</a>.
    *   Other minority groups have suggested the Antichrist could be the UN, a large computer, or an atheist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:39">[02:53:39]</a>. The speaker dismisses interpretations linking the Antichrist to contemporary figures or technologies (like the internet or cell phones) as "dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:47">[03:14:47]</a>, emphasizing the need for hermeneutics rather than newspaper headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:50">[03:14:50]</a>.

3.  **Historicist Interpretation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:38">[02:36:38]</a>:
    *   This perspective, which the speaker personally aligns with, posits that the Apocalypse is gradually fulfilled throughout human history from the time of Jesus until the end of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>.
    *   The interpretation of the Antichrist within this framework often points to a power that emerged from within Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:16">[02:56:16]</a>.
    *   Historically, early church fathers connected the Beast to Rome and the Roman Empire, which oppressed the early church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This was further developed by Protestant reformers (like Luther, Calvin, Zwingli) who unanimously identified the Antichrist with the papacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
    *   The speaker acknowledges the complex nature of this interpretation, noting that while the Antichrist must be someone who came out of Christianity and had influence during the apostolic era, it's not about accusing contemporary figures like Pope Francis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:51">[03:00:51]</a>.

4.  **Idealist/Symbolic Interpretation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>:
    *   This view considers the Apocalypse as a timeless, grand parable where everything is symbolic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:56">[02:55:56]</a>.
    *   The Beast, as an oppressive power, can be interpreted to denounce any form of oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>.
    *   For this view, the "meaning" of the symbols matters more than a literal fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:21">[02:56:21]</a>.

### The Antichrist in the Great Tribulation

Regardless of the specific interpretation, a common point among all theologians is the occurrence of a "great tribulation" at the end of the world's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:25">[01:36:25]</a>. During this period:
*   The Antichrist will dominate the earth with immense force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">[01:37:08]</a>.
*   Humanity will reach such a state of degeneration that the Holy Spirit will no longer have access to the human heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">[01:37:08]</a>.
*   Some believe that Jesus will rapture the church *before* this tribulation to spare it, leaving behind those not spiritually ready to face the Antichrist and suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>.
*   Others believe the church will endure *through* the tribulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>.

### Biblical Portrayal of the Antichrist

The Book of Revelation presents the Antichrist primarily as "the Beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>, a figure linked to the "dragon" (Satan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">[02:07:03]</a>. The Beast is described as:
*   Emerging from the sea with ten horns and seven heads, with names of blasphemy on its heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:45">[02:26:45]</a>.
*   Having a body like a leopard, feet like a bear, and a mouth like a lion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:56">[02:26:56]</a>.
*   Receiving its power, throne, and great authority from the dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:04">[02:27:04]</a>.
*   Given a mouth speaking arrogance and blasphemies, with authority to act for 42 months (which can also be interpreted as three and a half years or a "time, times, and half a time") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:25">[02:27:25]</a>. This duration is parallel to the period the woman (God's people) would be in the desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>.
*   Attempting to "change times and law" and oppressing the "saints of the Most High" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:52">[02:28:52]</a>.
*   Having a "mark" that people must receive on their forehead or hand to buy and sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:08">[03:12:08]</a>, a parody of God's commandments on the forehead and hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:44">[03:12:44]</a>.

The Antichrist is portrayed as a counterfeit of Christ, embodying an apparent solution to human problems at the cost of apostasy from truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:10">[02:55:10]</a>. The Bible warns believers to remain faithful and stand among the "faithful remnant" rather than conforming to the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:21">[03:12:21]</a>.

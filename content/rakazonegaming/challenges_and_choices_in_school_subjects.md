The web series "School Chale Hum" invites creators and YouTubers to discuss their [[schooling_experiences_of_creators_and_youtubers | schooling experiences]] and academic achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The show features a [[quiz_questions_related_to_school_subjects | quiz competition]] to test their general knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Academic Background and Subject Struggles

One guest, a creator from Variety, shared details about their [[personal_journey_and_challenges | personal journey]] through school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Language Proficiency
The guest attended an English medium school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. They recalled a period in school where they studied [[language_proficiency_and_challenges | English]] with a Sanskrit teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, noting the strictness associated with [[language_proficiency_and_challenges | English]] lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The guest proudly stated that their [[language_proficiency_and_challenges | English]] was "absolutely awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Subject Choice and Academic Performance
A significant challenge arose regarding subject choices after 10th grade:
*   **Desire for Science**: The guest's father wanted them to pursue science after 10th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Performance Barrier**: However, the guest did not get to take science because they scored 75% in 10th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This academic performance necessitated a change of school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Forced into Commerce**: Despite their aspirations, the guest eventually scored only five marks in science and was consequently "pushed into commerce" for 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Further Academic Struggles**: Even after studying commerce, their academic challenges persisted, as they only achieved 49.9% in 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This low score impacted their ability to gain admission to desired colleges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. They eventually gained admission to Bhartiya Vidyapeeth, similar to others with similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Academic Quizzes and Knowledge Gaps

The city experiences various challenges concerning its [[police_and_legal_system_challenges | police]] and legal system, ranging from ignored complaints to issues at checkpoints and the actions of [[crime_and_corruption | criminal organizations]].

## Challenges with Police Response
A recurring issue involves the responsiveness of the [[ingame_police_operations_and_patrols | police]]. Complaints lodged with the [[police_interactions_in_gta_5_rp | police]] have been repeatedly ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Individuals have reported being in "bad condition" at [[police_checkpoints | police checkpoints]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Criminal Activities and Law Enforcement Efforts
The city faces significant [[crime_and_corruption | criminal activity]], including the rise of "obscene people of the crime world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. There are instances where [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | criminals]] are forming organizations together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

[[Police_involvement_and_legal_proceedings | Police involvement]] has included the reported arrest of "Aditi ji," who was described as the CEO of [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | criminals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Additionally, a character named Rafiq is noted to have left after "sensational crimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Despite these efforts, challenges persist, with one character noting that if someone "breaks the mail built with your hard work and goes away," it evokes a strong desire for revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

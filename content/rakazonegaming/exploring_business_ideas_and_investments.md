In the city, individuals are constantly seeking opportunities for growth and financial success, leading to various discussions and proposals for new ventures and investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

## Business Aspirations and Partnerships
The character Hire expresses a strong desire to earn money and achieve significant success in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. He suggests that rather than taking conventional jobs like a builder or miner, one should consider starting a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. He proposes a partnership in a substantial business venture to Manav Singh, an individual he meets who shares a similar mindset about earning money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

## Legacy of a Builder Family
Hire reveals his family's history in the construction business, stating that his great-grandfather was a renowned builder in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. A prominent, unfinished building in Legion Square stands as a testament to his great-grandfather's work, which ceased after he suffered a heart attack on the construction site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This building is said to have been constructed on what was once a lush green forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

After the great-grandfather's passing, the business was [[business_success_and_personal_jealousy | usurped by his business partners]] while Hire's grandfather, due to his privileged upbringing, spent his life in leisure and indulgence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Hire's father, despite being intelligent and hardworking, struggled to revive the family business due to a lack of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. Witnessing his family's struggles has instilled in Hire a strong ambition to restore their name through his own business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

## New Business Ideas and Investment Opportunities
Hire is actively seeking investors for his business ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. He even considers approaching the police department (PD) for investment, indicating a belief in their potential interest in supporting local businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

### Proposed Business Ventures:
*   **Insurance Company**
    Hire proposes starting an insurance company to cover hospital bills for accidents, especially given people's distraction with phones and radio while driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:44">[02:16:44]</a>. The idea would involve weekly insurance payments, offering benefits like free hospital bills for insured individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:32">[02:18:32]</a>. He emphasizes the power of marketing to sell this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:21">[02:19:21]</a>.

*   **Food Delivery Service**
    Another idea is a food delivery service, offering on-call food delivery to any location within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:05">[02:20:05]</a>. Hire acknowledges existing services but believes in competition to drive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:16">[02:20:16]</a>.

*   **[[starting_a_finance_company_and_promises_of_doubling_money | Finance Company for Vehicle Purchases]]**
    Hire suggests establishing a finance company that would allow people to purchase cars on installment plans (EMI) with minimal interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:08">[02:21:08]</a>. This company would manage down payments and automatic deductions from accounts. In cases of non-payment, legal action would be taken, leading to the recovery of the vehicle and potentially other assets like homes, clothes, and phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:46">[02:21:46]</a>. He even details a "torture" method for recovery, where a debt collector would live with the debtor, using their amenities, to pressure them into paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>.

*   **Fashion School**
    Hire also discusses opening a fashion school in the city to help people improve their dress sense and overall grooming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:59">[02:10:59]</a>. He believes this could be a successful venture as it addresses a need for style improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>.

## Business Activities of Other Characters
Other characters are also involved in business:
*   Uncle is the owner of PDM (presumably a vehicle dealership) and also conducts recovery operations on the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   One character mentions his maternal uncle, Mali ji, who is a sweet person who engaged in a big business, having taken a lease from the government for a car showroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:24">[02:21:24]</a>.

## Investment and Support
The host and other characters are open to hearing business ideas and offering support, indicating a community interested in economic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:40">[03:05:40]</a>. There is also discussion around [[sponsorship_announcements_and_promotions | sponsorship announcements and promotions]] for events and products related to gaming and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, suggesting other avenues for financial engagement in the community.

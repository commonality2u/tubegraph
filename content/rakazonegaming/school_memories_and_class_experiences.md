## Early School Life and Backbenchers

Discussions brought up [[schooling_experiences_of_creators_and_youtubers | stories from school]], including a memory of a school class sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The speakers described themselves as being "born in this verse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, implying a certain upbringing. A specific area in the classroom was designated for "backward boys who were backbenchers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, which was their appointed spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Teachers would also frequent this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Anecdotes and Mischief

One [[funny_school_and_college_memories_of_mili_and_sakshi | humorous anecdote]] involved a trip to the hospital, where a madam called for teachers, and "it was fixed for one lakh each" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. There was also a time when some boys made "idli sandwich Grill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, a mischievous act.

## School Punishments and Lab Incidents

[[school_competitions_and_punishments | School punishments]] were part of the experience, as described by a rule of "no entry zone" on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. A memorable incident involved a student typing "citric acid" directly in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, which led to standing with hands raised for an entire week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This punishment continued for a whole week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. During lab sessions, students were required to keep a copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Another [[funny_school_and_college_memories_of_mili_and_sakshi | notable event]] included breaking a CD and obtaining â‚¹100 worth of ghee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Personal Experiences and Reflections

There was a mention of being in seventh grade and becoming "soft" in terms of giving money in school and college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. From a lower-middle-class background, money was scarce, and shops were full, indicating a challenging but resourceful upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The speaker also mentioned having "sweet crush" on Ajay on the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Technology and Quirks

A description of a setup included a mobile tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> and a complicated arrangement of wires connected to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. It was noted that a laptop had "one and a half stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> and that a phone charger was the only charging device available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The importance of subtle movements with a keyboard and mouse to avoid being caught by family members while typing excessively was also highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

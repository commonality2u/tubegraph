A company was involved in a large-scale scam, described as looting "the company of lakhs of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The operation was considered "completely" executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, with the entire company being labeled a "scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Personal Impact and Aftermath
The situation generated significant anger for one individual, leading to a swift change in their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This individual was in New Delhi, at both an office and a court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Consequences and [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | Criminal Activities]]
Following the scam, individuals associated with the company resorted to [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | criminal acts]] like robbery and kidnapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. They would "pick up innocent people, shoot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, and "do crime again and again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The police department became involved, with one person stating they had "started a war" with the police due to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## Victims and Confession
A group of individuals, who had started their own company, found themselves in a difficult situation. They were kidnapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, a sequence that lasted for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The police initially "failed" to resolve their case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. They had taken loans from many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Due to the company being closed, they felt compelled to engage in [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | criminal activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. People started threatening them, stating they would kill them if they tried to return money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This pressure led them to resort to "looting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a> as there was "no other way left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. They expressed anger towards the police for their inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. They had even launched a venture near a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. The police eventually solved their case, which provided significant relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, and robbery charges against them were reportedly waived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

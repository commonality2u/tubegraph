After taking ownership of casino machines, the protagonist embarked on a new venture aiming to establish a name for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While the casino brought fame and success, it also led to their kidnapping and forced labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Unbeknownst to their captors, they were inviting significant trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Meanwhile, an investigation by Navmi had already commenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Casino's Secret Identity

What appeared to be a regular gambling establishment to the public was, in fact, a "pan vault" for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The protagonist discovered this secret after leasing the casino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This vault contained the [[black_money_laundering_in_casinos | black money]] of many ministers, which was being converted into white money through the casino operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## The Heist: Objective and Risks

The primary objective of the operation was to steal this [[black_money_laundering_in_casinos | black money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The protagonist understood that the government would not easily let go of their illicit funds and would exert maximum effort to protect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This implied a potential confrontation with the entire city's police force, necessitating thorough preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The operation, though visible to the entire city, was primarily about the hidden [[black_money_laundering_in_casinos | black money]] known only to the government, which they couldn't openly acknowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

> "For the people, this place is just a gambling place, but for the government, it is like a pan vault. [[black_money_laundering_in_casinos | Black money]] of many ministers is lying in the casino. They are converting that [[black_money_laundering_in_casinos | black money]] into white through the casino and we have to steal that money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>

## The Hostage Situation and Police Response

During the operation, everyone in the casino became hostages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The entire police department quickly surrounded the casino, demanding surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The robbers, in turn, threatened to shoot hostages and blow up the entire casino if the police attempted to breach the premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Their demand was 5 million dollars to be arranged within five hours, with a strict warning against any harm to the hostages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. They specifically mentioned that an "Australian person" would be injured if there was any delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The casino gates were then sealed, and a "gate sipper" activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

From the perspective of the police, there were at least 50 officers inside the casino, with forces deployed at all entrances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. The robbers had planted C-4 explosives at the entrances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> and were holding over 50 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

As the situation escalated, the public began to perceive the perpetrators as terrorists, with the casino highjack becoming headline news on every channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The robbers instructed their team not to shoot without direct orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Escape and Deception

The most critical part of the plan was the escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. The team coordinated to bring hostages to the rooftop for the escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. They planned to use air rifles and grenades against the police deployed around the casino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

The money was successfully transferred to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. The plan involved escaping via helicopter, using the hostages as leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. The police were ultimately deceived, with the perpetrators making off with 100 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

## Reflections and Lessons Learned

The protagonist reflected on the journey, acknowledging that the city had given and taken a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. They realized that problems don't end by running away but by facing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. The events altered everything â€“ friends, family, and even love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Despite the difficulty of the heist, they succeeded, proving a point to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>. They viewed themselves as free birds, ready to move forward, locking away memories and embracing the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

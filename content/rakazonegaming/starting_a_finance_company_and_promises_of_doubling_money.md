The ambition to establish a significant presence in the city was evident, culminating in the accomplishment of building the city's biggest statue for $100 million [00:00:05]. The city itself is stated to have given "a lot" [00:00:14].

## Early Financial State and Opportunity

Initially, the narrator's dream was grand, but income was notably small [00:07:08]. This [[financial_struggles_and_achievements_in_the_city | financial struggle]] contrasted with the later realization of how easy it was to earn money in the city [00:07:59]. This insight paved the way for new ventures.

## Founding a Finance Company

With some [[exploring_business_ideas_and_investments | investment]] arranged [00:08:06], a finance company was opened in the narrator's name [00:08:20]. The stated purpose of this new corporation was to take up a small business where clients' money would be secure [00:08:56].

The company made bold promises to potential clients:

## Allegations and Company Collapse

The venture soon faced severe issues, marked by threats and police involvement [00:09:58]. The company's staff reportedly lost their jobs [00:10:21].

The narrator repeatedly complained to the police, but these complaints were reportedly ignored [00:12:07]. The situation escalated, with discussions about a "Scars Liquid [[exploring_business_ideas_and_investments | Investment]] and Banking Company" and a case of killing [00:12:18].

The entire company was described as a [[company_and_scam_allegations | scam]] and bogus [00:13:16]. The narrator's company was destroyed in a matter of minutes [00:13:44], leading to a strong desire for [[company_collapse_and_desire_for_revenge | revenge]] [00:13:47].

These specialized houses are designed to provide a comfortable and conducive environment for professional gamers and content creators, focusing on physical health, mental relaxation, and practical living needs.

## Nutritional Support
A key aspect of player well-being is nutrition. The facility provides [[nutritional_and_living_facilities_for_gamers | nutritional food]] prepared in a dedicated kitchen, which is highlighted as the favorite room in the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This ensures that established players, who often play tournaments throughout the day, have their dietary needs fully met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Living and Relaxation Areas

Players have a dedicated "living area" that was customized in detail by the roasters themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

A significant feature is the provision of separate rooms for most players, ensuring privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> and allowing individuals to watch movies, eat, or talk on the phone without disturbing others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

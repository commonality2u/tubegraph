This article details various [[ingame_events_and_experiences]] and the progression within the game world, including planned streams, specific [[ingame_activities_and_challenges]], and ongoing [[ingame_incidents_and_storytelling]].

## Upcoming Stream Events

A live stream is planned for tomorrow on Twitch to celebrate the streamer's brother's birthday, featuring a "heavy party stream" [00:06:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The event will include an 8-ball pool stream and potentially a Black Jack tournament [00:06:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The stream is scheduled from 9:30 PM to 10 AM [00:08:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Roleplay (RP) Server Engagement

The streamer clarifies their attendance at [[ingame_events_and_updates]] within the TL RP server [00:09:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. They state they do not intentionally miss events and usually play RP alternate days or up to four times a week [00:10:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Previously, there was a lack of communication about event timings, leading to accidental misses [00:10:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Current Ingame Activities and Challenges

### Blueprint Acquisition and Solo Missions
The current objective is to progress using a newly acquired blueprint [00:13:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The plan is to complete solo progression for this blueprint [00:13:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. However, a gun is needed to perform these solo missions, and the streamer is waiting for the official release of guns on the server [00:14:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

### Tillu's Court Case and Narrative Development
Tillu has won a court case against PD, which was initiated after being caught doing unnamed work [00:28:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, [00:28:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. This case was reportedly filed to impress Peach [00:34:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Kabir, who was involved in the incident leading to the case, is very angry [00:28:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.

### Robbery Planning and Execution
Players are discussing [[gaming_strategies_and_ingame_events]] for house robberies. Key points include:
*   The ability to earn three times the money at certain houses [01:24:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.
*   The need for lock picks (Phantom and normal) and a laptop for hacking [03:07:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>, [03:13:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:04">[03:13:04]</a>.
*   Discussion around who has blueprints for these items and potential deals for buying them in bulk [02:01:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:17">[02:01:17]</a>, [02:05:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:55">[02:05:55]</a>.
*   Plans for team composition during robberies: two people inside the house, two outside, and one on radio [03:41:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:21">[03:41:21]</a>.
*   The importance of escape routes and having a backup plan [01:24:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.
*   Methods for storing loot: bags are used, but once items are put in, the bag disappears, requiring a new one to be purchased [01:50:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, [01:51:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>, [03:19:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:50">[03:19:50]</a>. Alternatively, items can be kept in the car's trunk [02:27:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:29">[02:27:29]</a>.

### Ingame Character Interactions
Players frequently engage in [[ingame_character_interactions]], including personal conversations and lighthearted banter, often related to their ingame activities. For example, discussions about earning money and financial advice take place [01:17:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>, [01:47:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>.

## Game Mechanics and Physics
Players discuss various in-game physics and mechanics, particularly concerning car handling and jumps for evasion. These include:
*   Testing different car models like the A5, MG, and the "pickup" for speed, handling, and sound [01:04:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>, [01:07:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   Strategies for police evasion using jumps, including water jumps and railway track jumps, some considered "crazy" or "very difficult" [02:11:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:14">[02:11:14]</a>, [02:21:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, [02:26:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:02">[02:26:02]</a>.
*   Discussion about unique escape routes, such as using the Red Garage to jump onto the roof [02:26:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:39">[02:26:39]</a>.

## Future Plans and Development
The community discusses future updates, including the potential for new types of robberies beyond houses, such as stores, banks, ATMs, money trucks, casinos, and laboratories [03:28:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:14">[03:28:14]</a>, [03:30:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:41">[03:30:41]</a>. They also hope for features like time bombs and defusing mechanics [03:26:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:23">[03:26:23]</a>.

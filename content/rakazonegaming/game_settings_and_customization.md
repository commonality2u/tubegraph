Within the game, specific attention is given to [[ingame_customization_and_vehicle_upgrades | game settings]], particularly those relating to visual fidelity. Players are encouraged to apply "big guide settings ultra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These "settings on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> are further described as "settings on a very ultra violet orchid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, suggesting a high-quality visual mode or theme within the game.

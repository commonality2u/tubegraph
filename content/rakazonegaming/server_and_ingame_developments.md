## Current Server Status and Issues

The current server is reported to be working fine, though a player expresses that "nothing is happening to me" personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. There is a confirmed new server "coming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, which has led to speculation among players about whether a new server is being released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The streamer mentions using a "Mal [[Roleplay server management and monetization | RP Server]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>.

## In-Game Mechanics and Economy

Discussions touched on various [[Technical issues and ingame dynamics | in-game dynamics]]:
*   **Monetary system:** Mentions of "mark money" which can be converted into "real Money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:44">[03:40:44]</a>, with a commission taken during the conversion process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:51">[03:41:51]</a>. This conversion system will involve meetings with [[Community and server management in RP | city groups]] and gangs that have "heavy amount of mark money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:05">[03:52:05]</a>.
*   **Property:** A factory location is mentioned as being under lease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:29">[03:29:29]</a> and identified as government property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:38">[03:30:38]</a>.
*   **Vehicle Repair:** It is noted that mechanics are not always available in the city, and repair kits do not always work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:10">[03:20:10]</a>. Even the police repair kits are not effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>.
*   **Gun Licensing:** Legal guns require a 500 Rupee license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.
*   **Jail and Banning:** Mentions of players being "perma banned" or considering leaving the server due to management issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Characters can also be jailed, with discussions around jail time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:09">[02:29:09]</a> and lawyers who can "lie" to reduce sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:32">[02:29:32]</a>.

## Future Plans and Potential Features

A significant plot point involves a new business opportunity for "cleaning" black money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:45">[03:41:45]</a>. This venture, described as "dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:20">[03:55:20]</a> and "exciting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:36">[03:35:36]</a>, requires a loyal and intelligent partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:58">[03:34:58]</a>. The plan involves:
*   **Secret Locations:** Meetings will take place at a "super secret" factory location, which the speaker was taken to while "blind" with all cameras off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:51">[03:52:51]</a>. This location will also serve as a place to change identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:39">[03:45:39]</a>.
*   **Networking:** The player needs to manually talk to and get contact information from "well known groups" and gangs that possess large amounts of mark money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:53">[03:51:53]</a>.
*   **Gun Dealing:** With the previous gun dealer gone, a new one must be found to aid in the money cleaning process, potentially through "Exchange for Guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:05">[03:55:05]</a>.
*   **Disguises:** Building a "disguise" and having a "separate phone for full dealing" is necessary for privacy and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:15">[03:45:15]</a>.

The speaker also mentions the possibility of future [[Game updates | game updates]] incorporating community content, such as a "Ghost" storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:49">[03:57:49]</a>. There are also discussions about a "controversy" system that could increase views rather than subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:14">[03:17:14]</a>.

### Roleplay Scenarios and Storylines

Ongoing [[Ingame events and strategies | roleplay scenarios]] include:
*   **Conflict with Tillu and Martin:** A central conflict involves Tillu, who is accused of stealing 1 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:05">[02:53:05]</a> and being a "terrorist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:02">[02:49:02]</a>. There is also a past incident where bullets were fired in the PDM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. Martin, another character, was involved and later went to jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:25">[03:51:25]</a>.
*   **Police Involvement:** The police are actively involved in the chase and interrogation of characters like Tillu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>. There are accusations of police corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:31">[01:49:31]</a>.
*   **Kidnapping for Content:** A group of players orchestrated a fake kidnapping to create [[Roleplay server management and monetization | content]] for their channel, planning to release a "BTS" (behind-the-scenes) video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:32">[03:07:32]</a>. They sought to get a "police raid" on their video to increase virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:49">[03:10:49]</a>. They also plan to kidnap a "real policeman" and make a video about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:35">[03:11:35]</a>.

[!NOTE|New Server]
A new server is confirmed to be in development, with a specific "Mal [[Roleplay server management and monetization | RP Server]]" mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>.

## Technical Aspects and Admin Roles

*   **Admin Involvement:** An "admin" is mentioned in the context of locking a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:21">[03:46:21]</a> and being asked to avoid "Popat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:50">[03:46:50]</a> (a Hindi term for embarrassment or a blunder). This implies admin intervention in [[RP Server Technical Discussions | gameplay]] or managing issues.
*   **Body Cams:** Police officers are expected to wear body cams, and their absence or malfunction is noted during a suspicious incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:35">[03:51:35]</a>. This suggests protocols for evidence collection in [[Resolving ingame technical issues | roleplay situations]].

This article compiles [[memories_from_school_days | funny school memories]] and [[school_experiences_and_memories | humorous anecdotes]] shared by guests on the "School Let's Go" program. The discussions highlight various aspects of [[school_and_classroom_experiences | school and classroom experiences]], from academic interests to mischievous escapades.

## Favourite School Subjects and Academic Background
Guests shared their [[favourite_school_subjects_and_learning_experiences | preferred subjects]] and academic journeys. One participant mentioned liking English during school [00:03:42]. Another recalled enjoying economics and chemistry, specifically praising a chemistry teacher for their beautiful teaching style [00:03:55]. Regarding higher education, one guest completed their graduation, attributing it partly to liking "Katie" during that time [00:01:50]. In contrast, another guest hadn't completed their second year of studies and therefore lacked a certificate, despite considering themselves an "official graduate" [00:02:09].

## Humorous Escapades
The guests shared two distinctively funny stories from their school days.

### The McDonald's Escape
Ankita Chauhan recounted a memorable incident during a science exhibition held at another school [00:10:26]. While there, she planned to sneak away to McDonald's with her school boyfriend [00:10:29]. Her father had called, jokingly suggesting there was no food at home and she should eat at McDonald's [00:10:39]. Despite the teacher's insistence that all students would be dropped off at their own school, Ankita and her boyfriend seized an opportunity [00:10:43]. They crossed a road with a central line to catch a rickshaw, all while their teachers were standing on the other side, aware of their McDonald's plan [00:10:47]. They managed to hail a rickshaw and crossed a signal, with their teachers waving frantically for them to stop [00:11:06]. Ankita even bid farewell to her teacher directly before leaving [00:11:23]. After enjoying food at McDonald's, they returned to an empty school and went home [00:11:31]. The next day, her vice principal called her father to inform him of his daughter's escapade [00:11:38].

### The Window Escape
Another guest shared a story of a group effort to escape school through a window [00:12:02]. Their group frequently sat near a left-side window [00:12:06]. One of their friends, possessing great strength, gradually damaged the railing near their seating area [00:12:14]. After checking that the school authorities weren't inspecting the damaged area, they planned their escape [00:12:22]. After three or four days, they attempted their escape, with one student making the first successful attempt [00:12:29]. This success led to a series of escapes through the window [00:12:43]. However, their luck eventually ran out, and they were caught, resulting in significant disciplinary action [00:12:45].

The episode also features a [[school_quiz_with_general_knowledge_questions | school quiz]] with general knowledge questions, adding to the school-themed content [00:04:07].

Reflecting on [[gaming_experiences | gaming experiences]], some moments can lead to significant frustration.

## Criticisms of Game Design
Some games are designed in a way that elicits strong negative reactions. One sentiment expressed is that "this is a very bad game friend it should not be made like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. This highlights a direct dissatisfaction with a game's creation or functionality.

## [[Technical issues in gaming and troubleshooting | Technical Issues]]
Challenges can arise when devices malfunction during gameplay. For instance, a "mobile is getting switched off and there is a hole in it in the middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>, which would undoubtedly interrupt the [[gaming_experiences | gaming experience]] and cause frustration.

## Specific Game Mentions
While the context for frustration is not explicitly detailed, games such as "Temple Run" are mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Additionally, a generic reference to "this game" notes that "payment found its lines in this game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>, although the meaning here remains unclear in relation to frustration.

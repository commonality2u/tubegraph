[[mohammed_shamis_bowling_performance | Mohammed Shami]] commenced his bowling with the first ball of the match between Kings XI Punjab and Sunrisers Hyderabad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. His initial delivery was notable, described as "Messi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

On his first ball, bowled to Rabbit Wander, the shot was "clicked" and there was no fielder to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This delivery resulted in a "choker on the wall," which was hit by [[performance_of_shikhar_dhawan | Chris Gayle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The early action suggested a "very exciting match" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

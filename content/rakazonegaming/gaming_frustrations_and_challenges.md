Experiencing difficulties and frustrations within video games can stem from various sources, ranging from the game's design to technical issues. One common sentiment expresses dissatisfaction with a game's overall quality or design.

## Poor Game Design

Players can encounter [[gaming_challenges_and_obstacles | gaming challenges and obstacles]] related to a game's fundamental design. A strong critique was leveled against a specific game, with one individual stating, "first this is a very bad game friend it should not be made like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52">[12:52]</a>. This suggests a significant dissatisfaction with the game's mechanics or overall experience, impacting [[emotional_experiences_in_gaming | emotional experiences in gaming]].

## Technical and Performance Issues

[[Technological challenges in gaming | Technological challenges in gaming]] and [[technical_issues_in_gaming | technical issues in gaming]] can severely disrupt gameplay. An example of such a problem includes a mobile device "getting switched off" mid-game, or having "a hole in it in the middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24">[13:24]</a>. These kinds of [[technical_issues_and_troubleshooting_in_gaming | technical issues and troubleshooting in gaming]] directly impede a player's ability to continue playing and can lead to considerable frustration.

## In-Game Mechanics and Economy

Frustrations can also arise from specific in-game mechanics, such as payment systems. A player noted that "payment found its lines in this game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19">[13:19]</a>, which could imply issues with in-game purchases, monetization, or the integration of payment systems into the gameplay experience.

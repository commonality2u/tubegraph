## Technical Aspects and Game Updates

The host confirmed they were playing [[gta_5_roleplay_streams | RP]] and had resolved previous issues, ensuring no disconnects due to wearing headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Everything had been upgraded, though an attempt to install a "na mode" (likely a graphics mod) was abandoned because it caused too much lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The game's graphics were kept simple to avoid problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

A character named Javier (or "Higher") introduced himself as a stock trader offering quick returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>. He claimed to invest people's money in stocks and proposed a model where a $100 investment could yield $400 in a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:05">[02:08:05]</a>.

*   **Team Coordination:** The importance of moving and engaging together is highlighted, with phrases like "play together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a> and "everyone goes together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:30">[03:06:30]</a> repeated.

*   **Critiques and Praise:** Players are openly called "noobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a> or "dirty players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>.

The gaming facility, also referred to as the VLT boot camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, has been built with significant effort to accommodate players and content creation teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The aim is to fill the [[gaming_house_facilities | facility]] with both national and international trophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Content Creation and Editing Areas

### Editor's Room
An important room within the house is dedicated to editing, where "block editing" is consistently in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This space provides the best [[Gaming Live Streams and Content Creation | facility]] for editors to work on content day and night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Green Screen Studio
The studio is highlighted as a favorite room, featuring a green screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. All video shoots are conducted in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Player-Focused Areas

### Kitchen and Nutrition Area
The kitchen is considered the favorite room, where delicious and nutritious food is prepared for the players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Full attention is given to the nutrition of established players who spend their entire day playing tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This focus on nutrition is a key aspect of the boot camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Main Gaming Floor / Practice Area
The main gaming floor is designed to provide "top-notch [[Live Streaming Gaming | gaming]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The design prioritizes player comfort and features customized PCs from Logitech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

A set of rules is enforced on this floor to maintain cleanliness, specifically "no eating on the floor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
The audio setup is crucial, with specific attention paid to headphones to ensure clear sound for strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Strategy Room
This room is ideal for strategy discussions and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Players and coaches gather here to watch and analyze gameplay together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Living Area
Designed for relaxation after intense tournaments, the living area allows players to unwind and regulate their energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. It's a space where everyone relaxes and prepares for the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This area has been customized in detail by all the roasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

A notable feature within the living area is the "Wall of Speaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Player Rooms (Individual)
Each player at the VLT boot camp generally has a separate room to ensure privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This setup allows individuals to have personal time for activities like watching movies, eating, or making phone calls without disturbing others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Gymnasium
Recognizing the importance of physical activity for players who spend significant time at desks, the [[gaming_house_facilities | facility]] includes a gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The gym is provided to help players stay active and maintain their physical well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

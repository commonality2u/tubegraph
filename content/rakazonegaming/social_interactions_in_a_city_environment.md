In modern city environments, a notable absence of direct personal interaction has been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This lack of engagement can lead to feelings of loneliness, which is identified as a mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. There is a perceived scarcity of individuals who proactively ask about one's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Attempts to Foster Connection
To counter this, some individuals establish platforms, such as subscriber bases, to allow people to [[online_community_interactions | share their experiences of pain and suffering]] and ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This approach aims to create a sense of [[community_engagement_and_interactions | community and alleviate loneliness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## City-Specific Interactions
Meetings occur in various urban settings, such as an office where people gather to purchase jewelry, creating opportunities for [[social_interactions_and_chat_etiquette_in_games | conversation and connection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. In some settings, a [[friends_and_social_interactions_during_live_streams | tradition exists of gifting something]] when meeting a beautiful girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

The city environment, exemplified by Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, serves as a backdrop for both personal narratives and shared experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Individuals may share personal stories, including sad ones, and discuss how negativity can be transformed into positivity within this urban context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

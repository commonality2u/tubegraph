Suresh Raina has been a notable player for the [[mahendra_singh_dhonis_role_in_chennai_super_kings | Chennai Super Kings]] (CSK) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

During a match against [[mumbai_indians_vs_chennai_super_kings_rivalry | Mumbai Indians]], after [[mahendra_singh_dhonis_captaincy | Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] won the toss and CSK chose to bat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, Suresh Raina was involved in the early stages of the innings. He managed to secure 11 runs in the first over of the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. His performance was noted by commentators, with one remarking on his "good performance here slowly along with shoulder" and his presence alongside Rohit Sharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Another commentator mentioned a "Raina presenting here" in a somewhat unclear context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Later in the game, when [[mahendra_singh_dhonis_role_in_chennai_super_kings | Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] and Kedar Jadhav formed a pair for batting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, there was an expectation that if Dhoni were to "come up he will hit a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. The team's strategy also involved utilizing spinners like Mayank Markande <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

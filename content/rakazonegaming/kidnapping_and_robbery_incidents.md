This article outlines various instances and perspectives related to [[kidnapping_and_coerced_actions | kidnapping]] and [[robbery_and_theft_in_urban_settings | robbery]], including the motivations behind such acts and interactions with law enforcement.

## Incidents and Actions

Criminals are described as engaging in various illegal activities, including [[robbery_and_theft_in_urban_settings | robbery]], [[kidnapping_and_coerced_actions | kidnapping]], picking up innocent people, and shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. There is a specific mention of a plan to "loot the company of lakhs of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> and repeatedly stating intentions to "loot it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. One individual recalls a "big disease was looted" a day prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

A prominent incident detailed is the [[kidnapping_and_coerced_actions | kidnapping]] of Ajay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, which is repeated multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. The narrator and their friends were also [[kidnapping_and_coerced_actions | kidnapped]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, a situation that lasted for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

## Motivations for Criminality

The [[criminal_activities_and_conflicts_with_police | criminal activities]] described appear to stem from severe financial distress. After their company closed, individuals felt forced to engage in [[criminal_roleplay_scenarios | criminal acts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. They had borrowed money from many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a> and were threatened with violence if they failed to return the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This pressure led them to [[robbery_and_theft_in_urban_settings | loot]] a "big Amma" as there was "no other way left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

## Police Involvement and Consequences

The police are accused of failing to resolve the [[kidnapping_and_coerced_actions | kidnapping]] case, which was eventually solved privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The police also allegedly waived off [[robbery_and_theft_in_urban_settings | robbery]] charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. There is significant anger directed at the police for their perceived inaction and for the need for individuals to turn to [[criminal_activities_and_conflicts_with_police | criminal activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The narrator states that the police will face consequences for their wrongdoings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Despite a "war" with the police department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, it was believed that nothing would happen to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

## Betrayal and Personal Impact

An individual expresses that their life changed due to anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, becoming known as a "liminal" in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Betrayal is also mentioned, with someone named Monica betraying for money despite being considered an elder sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

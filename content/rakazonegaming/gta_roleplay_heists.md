### Necessary Equipment

A specific dealer named "Gus" is known to provide "all types of things," including guns, which news spreads quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
A basic pistol might cost around 1 lakh rupees, with at least four needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Magazines are also required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:39">[01:40:39]</a>.

### Roles and Team

*   **Hacker/Laser Specialist**: Responsible for disabling lasers and other security measures.

Hacking requires applying "thermite" and interacting with computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:32">[02:03:32]</a>.
*   **Driver**: Responsible for the getaway vehicle and blocking police during the escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.

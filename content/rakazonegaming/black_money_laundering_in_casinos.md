The main character's journey began with taking ownership of casino machines and starting a new venture to make a name for themselves, which brought fame and success but also led to their kidnapping and forced labor in the casino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This new [[investment_and_business_schemes_during_gaming_sessions | investment and business schemes during gaming sessions]] soon uncovered a deeper, illicit secret within the establishment.

## Casino as a "Pan Vault"

While a casino is perceived by the general public as merely a place for gambling, it functions as a "pan vault" for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Through this casino, black money belonging to numerous ministers is laundered and converted into legitimate funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This revelation came to light after taking the casino on lease, exposing many hidden aspects of its operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## The Objective: Stealing Black Money

The primary objective of the group, which includes Kisan, Churna, Tillu, Ashish, and the main character, is to steal this black money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This act directly challenges the government, which holds classified information about these funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Government's Response

The government cannot openly acknowledge the existence of this black money, making their response to the heist a complex issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Despite this, they are expected to go to extreme lengths to protect their illicit funds, as they will not easily let go of their black money and "will do anything for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The entire city's police force may be mobilized to prevent the theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

The heist and subsequent police response demonstrate significant [[crime_and_investigation_in_a_casino_setting | criminal activities and underworld connections]] within the casino setting. The robbers demanded 5 million dollars and had strategically planted C-4 explosives at the casino entrances, threatening to blow up the entire establishment if authorities tried to break in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Financial Outcome

Despite the elaborate plans to steal the black money, the operation resulted in the robbers being "fooled" and defrauding the country of 100 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

*   **Peach**: A female character frequently interacting with Tillu and other characters. She is involved in various in-game scenarios, including a court case [00:28:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, and discussions about her financial independence and career [02:56:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>.

### In-Game Activities and Plot Points
Characters engage in discussions about purchasing cars [02:42:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:40">[02:42:40]</a>, managing in-game finances [01:31:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>, and planning "robbery" missions [01:31:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>.

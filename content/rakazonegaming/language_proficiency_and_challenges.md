Language proficiency is highlighted as a significant skill within the "School Chale Hum" series, particularly noting the ability to speak multiple languages.

## Multi-Language Ability
One guest, Dhvani, is noted for knowing five languages, including Marathi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:26">[02:25:26]</a>. This linguistic capability is described as a "very good thing" and a "big thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>. Another participant is asked about their knowledge of Gujarati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:48">[02:32:48]</a>. While no specific [[challenges_and_choices_in_school_subjects | challenges]] are detailed regarding the *acquisition* of these languages, the context implies that multilingualism is highly regarded.

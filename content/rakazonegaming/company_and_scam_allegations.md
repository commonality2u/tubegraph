A company was alleged to have "looted lakhs of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The statement "the whole company is a scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> indicates direct accusations of fraudulent activity. This situation generated intense anger for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, leading to a significant life change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> which involved becoming a wanted criminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Establishment and Initial Challenges
The speaker and friends founded their own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Soon after [[starting_a_finance_company_and_promises_of_doubling_money | starting the company]], the speaker and friends were [[kidnapping_charges_and_legal_implications | kidnapped]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, a sequence that continued for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The police were initially unsuccessful in resolving the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

The company had taken loans from many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The company eventually closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, and the police reportedly waived off robbery charges against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Transition to Criminality
Due to the [[company_collapse_and_desire_for_revenge | company being closed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, individuals were forced into [[criminal_activities_and_underworld_connections | criminal activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Threats were received from people demanding their money back, stating they would be killed if they tried to return the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This pressure led them to commit robberies as there was "no other way left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. The speaker later became known as a criminal in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Conflict with Police
The speaker developed significant anger towards the [[police_misconduct_and_tampering_reports | police]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, stating they were "venting their anger on the police" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Despite the conflict, the speaker once worked within the same police department they were now warring against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. The police were actively searching for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## Betrayal
A person named Monica, who was considered an elder sister, betrayed the speaker "because of the greed for a few rupees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

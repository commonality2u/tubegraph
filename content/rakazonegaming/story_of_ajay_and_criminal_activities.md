Ajay's journey into [[criminal_activities_and_underworld_connections | criminal activities]] began with intense anger after a company scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This anger unexpectedly transformed his life, leading him to become a wanted criminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Initial Events and Motivations

Ajay and his friends initially ran their own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. However, they were kidnapped, an ordeal that lasted for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. During this time, the police failed to solve their case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Eventually, their case was resolved, and robbery charges against them were waived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

The company's closure forced them into a "criminal five" lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. They had borrowed money from many people, which caused significant distress when they could not repay it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. People began threatening them with death if they didn't return the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Faced with no other option, they resorted to [[criminal_activities_and_underworld_connections | looting]] a "big Amma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

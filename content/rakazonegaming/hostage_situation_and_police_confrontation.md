On the day of the incident, everyone inside the casino became [[robbery_scenarios_in_gta_5_roleplay|hosts]] (hostages), including many of the main character's friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Police Response and Demands

The entire [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|police]] department surrounded the casino, declaring that no one would be able to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|police]] demanded that the individuals inside leave all "hospitals" (hostages) and surrender quietly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

The captors threatened that if the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|police]] attempted to break in, the entire casino would be blown up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. They also warned that they would shoot down all the hostages if the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|officers]] did not cooperate quietly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The captors' demand was 5 million dollars, which the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|police]] stated would be arranged within 5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|police]] emphasized that nothing should happen to the "hostess" (hostages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The captors instructed the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|police]] to take a pass and warned that any delay would result in injury to the "Australian person" (a specific hostage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Inside the Casino

At least 50 [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|policemen]] were positioned inside the casino, with the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|police force]] deployed at all entrances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, and C-fors (explosives) were planted at the entrances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The captors declared that everything was under their control and that the hostages would be left alive if they cooperated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. News channels widely reported the casino "high" (heist/hostage situation), with the captors being labeled as terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Orders were given that no one was to shoot any hostage without explicit command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Hostages were systematically being moved inside the casino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## Strategic Considerations and Escape

The captors aimed to waste as much [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues|police]] time as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. They had a plan for escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>, involving the use of a helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. The plan was to use the cover of night to disappear among the "haunted people" (civilians) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

The captors confirmed that all the money had been transferred to the bank as requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Ultimately, the captors deceived the authorities, making off with 100 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>. This act was seen as a direct challenge to the government, who the captors believed would not back down due to their unlimited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

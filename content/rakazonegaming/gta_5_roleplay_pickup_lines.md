## Examples of Pickup Lines and Flirtatious Dialogue

Characters in [[grand_theft_auto_5_roleplay | Grand Theft Auto 5 Roleplay]] may attempt to use pickup lines in unexpected situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. One character suggests trying a pickup line on a girl who is following them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, offering the line:
> "Oh madam in panties, come in panties my love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

More abstract or suggestive interactions also occur, such as a narrative about a boy meeting a beautiful girl whose "9-inch penis" shocked her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

Some flirtatious exchanges can be aggressive or contain veiled threats, as seen when one character warns another:
> "I am in your heart, don't hit me, okay, I was sewing, I will cut your toy and throw it away, if you come too close to me, then you will bring it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

Another complex and somewhat philosophical pickup attempt involves a character stating:
> "If by mistake any son or wife of mine and yours gets married then there will be a problem but a child is not born by touching if I kiss in any other way then oh the prince of half wants to fall in love have you not seen seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

## Achieving Fame and Success

Ajay's casino endeavors brought him significant recognition, [[casino_ownership_and_personal_transformation | success]], and fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This success was evident in material possessions, such as once owning a white Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## The Onset of Jealousy

Despite achieving [[casino_ownership_and_personal_transformation | success]], it led to envy from others. It was noted that some individuals, who lived nearby, were not supportive and could not "digest" or accept Ajay's happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Consequences of Envy

The inability of others to tolerate his happiness escalated to direct harm, as some individuals resorted to kidnapping Ajay and forcing him into various activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This hostility also manifested in damage to his property, as his white Lamborghini was broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

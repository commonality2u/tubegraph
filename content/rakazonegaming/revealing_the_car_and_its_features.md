## The Grand Reveal

The live stream for the car reveal began with a photo session [00:00:38]. The host planned a quick exterior [[driving_and_vehicle_maintenance_insights | car overview]] before going for a drive and picking up a friend named Pooja [00:05:06]. The car itself is about one and a half years old [00:11:24] and was purchased new [00:11:42], not second-hand [00:11:43]. The purchase price was approximately 8.5 [00:12:22].

## Exterior and Aesthetics

The car is described as looking "crazy" and "like a boom" on camera [00:11:28]. It's a black car, which means dust is often visible [00:12:34]. The side profile is particularly admired [00:12:01]. There were also discussions about the car's size and how people appear smaller next to it [00:12:56]. The car has an HR number plate, consistent with the owner living in Gurgaon [00:12:11]. The car was recently washed, though some dust remained [00:11:48].

## Interior and Comfort Features

The interior of the car boasts several modern amenities:
*   **Paddle Shifters** For manual racing in sports mode [00:14:40].

## Performance and Handling

If the car breaks down or is in an accident, pressing this button directly connects to the head office/maintenance department, who will arrange for towing, repairs, and even hotel stays or flights if far from home [00:38:31]. This service covers incidents across cities, such as a breakdown in Jaipur with transport back to Gurgaon [00:38:46].

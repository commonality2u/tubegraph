The "School Chale Hum" series features guests answering [[school_and_classroom_experiences | school-related questions]] about what they studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This includes topics relevant to science education and the evolution of understanding, particularly concerning planetary bodies.

## Educational Background and Subject Preferences

One guest, Dhvani, completed her [[school_experiences_and_memories | schooling]] at Aspities and pursued a B.Com followed by an LLB from Mitthu bhai college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. When asked about [[favourite_school_subjects_and_learning_experiences | favourite subjects]], one participant stated they liked history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Science-Related Questions

The discussion included several general knowledge and science-based questions:
*   **National Anthem** The question "who wrote the National Anthem of India" was posed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Tallest Mountain** India's tallest mountain was identified as Kanchenjunga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, after a hint that its name starts with 'K' for Kolkata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Planetary System** A key question was "which is the smallest planet in our solar system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. While the participant initially considered Pluto, stating "that is what we studied in [[school_and_classroom_experiences | school]] last," it was acknowledged that "now all this has changed" in terms of planetary classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The correct answer, Mercury, was eventually suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This highlights how scientific understanding and [[school_subject_choices_and_their_impacts | curricula]] evolve over time.
*   **Human Anatomy** The smallest bone in the human body was asked about, with the answer being in the ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Other Knowledge Questions

Questions unrelated to science or planetary changes were also asked, such as the colors of the Olympic rings (red, yellow, blue, black, green) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> and the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

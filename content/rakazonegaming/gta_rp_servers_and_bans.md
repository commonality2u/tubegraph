## Current Server Status: TL RP Ban
The TL RP Strike Server has been banned for 14 days, effective from 5 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. During this period, server activity will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The official announcement regretted to inform users that the server was down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Suspected Reasons for the Ban
The primary suspected reason for the TL RP ban is the use of real-world vehicle names and brands within the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It's believed that the server's structure might include elements not permitted by the platform's license agreement, specifically concerning real-world elements like car brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. Comparisons between real-world brands in the server, without permission, are not allowed in [[GTA 5 Role Play RP gaming | RP servers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. The server owner suggests that all real-world vehicles must be completely removed from the server for compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>.

Some also speculate that "mass reporting" could be a factor, though the speaker believes it's more about policy violations related to cars and alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Servers typically receive a notice or warning before a ban, and if issues are not fixed in time, a proper shock, like a ban, is imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:19">[02:56:19]</a>.

## Policies Governing [[GTA 5 RP Server updates | GTA RP Servers]]
The governing rules for [[GTA 5 Roleplay on Indian servers | GTA 5 Roleplay on Indian servers]] are set by 5M and Rockstar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:55">[02:22:55]</a>. These policies restrict the use of real-world names, logos, and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>. For example, specific MLOs (Map Location Objects) or custom content that uses real-world branding, even if fan-made, can lead to issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. When 5M merged with Rockstar, more restrictions were put in place, aiming to keep content purely within the [[GTA 5 Role Play RP gaming | GTA]] universe without real-world company logos or products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a>. This is to avoid legal complications, such as a company suing Rockstar if their brand is associated with violence or negative events in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>.

Customizations like character clothing or accessories can be made, but if they carry real-world logos or branding, it becomes a policy violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>. Even custom phone numbers or ringtones could face copyright issues if they use copyrighted songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.

## Economics of Running a [[GTA Role Playing Servers in India | GTA Role Playing Server]]
Running a [[GTA Roleplay on Indian Server | GTA Roleplay on Indian Server]] involves significant costs and various revenue models:

### Expenses
*   **Hosting:** A basic server hosting costs around Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:24">[01:56:24]</a>.
*   **Developers:** Hiring full-time, dedicated developers is crucial for custom content and bug fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>. A full-stack developer can charge around Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:52">[01:42:52]</a>. For a server built from scratch, multiple developers (5-6) are needed for different departments like car creation, script writing, and bug testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>. A top-tier custom server might cost around Rs 6-7 lakhs per month for development alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:38">[01:55:38]</a>.
*   **Assets:** While some assets can be purchased online (e.g., from Gabs, an official 5M guy), unique MLOs and custom features require dedicated development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:02">[02:24:02]</a>.
*   **Maintenance:** Ongoing bug fixes and updates require permanent developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>.

### Revenue Models
[[GTA role play in Indian servers | RP servers]] primarily earn money from two sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>:
*   **Priority Slots:** Players pay for priority access to the server, ensuring direct entry without waiting in queues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>.
*   **Asset Sales:** This includes selling in-game vehicles, custom clothing, custom accessories, and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:43">[02:23:43]</a>. These sales can be significant, sometimes involving real money auctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:54">[02:23:54]</a>.
*   **Subscription Model:** A proposed model where players pay a certain amount to get whitelisted and access exclusive content, helping the server break even and generate profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>.

Some public servers without prominent streamers can still earn significant profits, reportedly up to Rs 2-2.5 lakhs per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>. No Pixel reportedly earned millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.

## Challenges and Future of [[GTA 5 Roleplay on Indian servers | Indian GTA RP Servers]]
Building a new [[GTA 5 roleplay server updates and announcements | GTA 5 roleplay server updates and announcements]] from scratch is a massive undertaking, estimated to take at least 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:27">[01:58:27]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   **Developer Availability:** Finding developers with good creativity and specific game development skills is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:34">[02:33:34]</a>, especially those willing to work for local currency rather than dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Investment:** The initial and ongoing investment is substantial, making it a high-risk venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:10">[01:50:10]</a>.
*   **Policy Compliance:** Adhering to Rockstar and 5M policies is critical to avoid bans. This means avoiding real-world branding, even for community-made content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.
*   **Community Management:** Maintaining a large and engaged player base while handling personal disputes and ensuring proper roleplay behavior is vital for [[Gameplay dynamics of GTA 5 RP | server health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:24">[02:28:24]</a>.
*   **Technical Issues:** Servers can face DDoS attacks and require constant bug testing and fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:53">[03:09:53]</a>.

The idea of a new server with direct Rockstar collaboration was floated, but it's complex due to 5M being acquired by Rockstar and their policy of not allowing third-party entities to monetize their mods without revenue sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:58">[01:32:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>.

The speaker aims to build a completely custom server, avoiding copying existing scripts, and focusing on creating engaging [[GTA 5 Role Play RP gaming | RP scenarios]] from scratch that evolve naturally from a basic progression line, rather than just crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:06">[02:10:06]</a>. This includes features like custom phone numbers and ringtones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:08">[02:05:08]</a>. The importance of fostering a non-toxic environment where players respect each other during [[Police interactions in GTA 5 RP | roleplay]] and avoid out-of-character (OC) drama is also stressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:10">[02:12:10]</a>.

*   Understanding that when working on dreams, one will either win or learn, never lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   The importance of not giving up or regretting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   The idea that a dream belongs to the individual, and they must work hard on it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Remembering that success is a long and lonely road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

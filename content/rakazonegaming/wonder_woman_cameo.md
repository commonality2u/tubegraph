During the discussion, a brief mention is made of a "skin Wonder Woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22"></a>. This suggests the presence of a cosmetic or character variant related to Wonder Woman within the context of the video's content, rather than a traditional narrative cameo.

Other DC Universe or comic book character mentions in the video include [[iron_man_moments | Iron Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14"></a> and [[spiderman_appearances | Spiderman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18"></a>.

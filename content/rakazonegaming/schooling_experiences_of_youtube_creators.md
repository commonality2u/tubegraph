A notable [[school_experiences_and_memories | memory]] was studying English with a Sanskrit teacher due to strictness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. They scored 75% in their 10th standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, which necessitated changing [[school_and_classroom_experiences | schools]] as they could not pursue science, despite their father's wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. After [[school_and_classroom_experiences | school]], this [[streamers_and_gaming_content | creator]] secured a job through off-campus efforts rather than college placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

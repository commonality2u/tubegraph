A storyline emerged in GTA RP involving a character named Neeraj, who operates as a private detective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This development surprised other characters, who questioned why they weren't informed when the "state was hiring detectives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Neeraj's Role and Operations

Neeraj is identified as a "private detective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. He is also referred to as "Pvt Neeraj Neeraj" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> and serves as a "point of contact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. There's a playful dynamic around the secrecy of his employment, with characters asking if he was hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> and humorously noting that others have "started hiding" information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Tools and Techniques

A key tool demonstrated by the private detective character is an RF (Radio Frequency) scanner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This device allows him to "find out the frequency of anyone's radio without me knowing their radio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. He was observed scanning frequencies, identifying two ranges: one "between 730 to 760" and another "between 190 to 210" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The scanner can precisely determine a radio's exact frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Associated Characters

Another character, Sarvesh Joshi, introduces himself, stating his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. His relation to the private detective storyline is not explicitly detailed but occurs within the same conversation.

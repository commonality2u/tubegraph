RP servers involve various technical aspects related to their operation, in-game mechanics, and asset management.

## Server Operations & Player Activity
Regular player engagement is noted, with one streamer playing RP on alternate days, or a maximum of two to three times a week, sometimes four times if everything runs smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. There have been instances where players missed server events due to a lack of prior knowledge about when they would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This led to rumors that intentional event skipping was happening, which was denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## In-Game Mechanics and Features
### Blueprints and Item Progression
The discussion touches on obtaining and progressing blueprints within the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This progression can potentially be done solo without others noticing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. The availability of items like guns is also a point of discussion, with players noting existing guns on the server but questioning when official new ones will be released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

### Vehicle Customization and Copyright
The server has faced issues with in-game cars and copyright, potentially due to [[Rockstars policy on RP servers | Rockstar's policy on RP servers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. This has led to restrictions on using certain car names or requiring permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>. Players anticipate vehicle upgrades to improve performance and sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>.

### Inventory and Storage
A key technical detail involves how items are stored in vehicles. Players discuss the limitations of car trunks ("dickies") for carrying large quantities of items, suggesting that only smaller items can be easily stored, while larger ones might require external storage or different methods of transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>. Some players also mention the ability to access car storage via a "glove box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:48">[03:05:48]</a>.

### Hacking and Lockpicking
The topic of hacking and lockpicking appears as a means to acquire items. A "normal lock pick" is mentioned, and there's a distinction between it and a "Phantom lockpick," which is implied to be for more advanced or specific locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:03">[03:07:03]</a>. The process of hacking involves using a laptop, pouring "powder" into it, and then applying it to a safe to unlock it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:56">[03:07:56]</a>. These "small" safes are associated with "tellers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:12">[03:08:12]</a>.

### Server Limitations and Development
There's a desire for more advanced in-game features, such as "time bombs" and "defusing scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:23">[03:46:23]</a>, suggesting a continuous interest in [[Server and ingame developments | server and in-game developments]]. The limitations on how many players can be in certain locations or perform certain actions (e.g., two people inside a house, two outside, and one on radio) highlight the server's rule-based or technical constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:21">[03:41:21]</a>. Players also note that the server doesn't allow robbing stores, banks, ATMs, or money trucks, but casinos and construction sites are active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:16">[03:28:16]</a>. There's an anticipation for the ability to rob a "pill box" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:24">[03:30:24]</a>.

### Player Housing and Storage
Players discuss the option of renting apartments for storage, with different prices corresponding to different storage capacities (e.g., 800 daily for more storage, 500 daily for less) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>. These rentals are typically for two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>. Access to these rented rooms requires a card, and if the card is lost or turned around, access can be compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:36">[01:44:36]</a>. Housing also comes into play when discussing strategies for illegal activities, such as having safe houses to sell stolen goods, where certain houses yield triple the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:59">[02:29:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:54">[02:49:54]</a>.

### Network and Connectivity
One player mentions their "wifi guy died," which humorously affects their in-game experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:52">[03:34:52]</a>.

Overall, the discussions provide insight into the specific mechanics and rules that govern interactions and progression within the RP server, touching upon aspects of [[Roleplay Server Dynamics | roleplay server dynamics]] and [[Challenges and technical issues in RP | technical challenges]].

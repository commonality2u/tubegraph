From: [[rakazonegaming]] <br/> 

The narrative highlights significant challenges within the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues | police]] and legal systems, touching on issues of [[crime_and_corruption | crime]], [[policing_and_justice_in_the_context_of_crime | justice]], and the effectiveness of law enforcement.

## Instances of Criminal Activity and System Response

A key concern revolves around extensive [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | criminal activities]] such as [[crime_and_corruption | looting]] companies involving "lakhs of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, as well as accusations of an entire company being a "scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The speaker reflects on being in "New Delhi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, then in "the office and... the court," fueled by anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The discussion frequently references "criminals" who engage in "robbery," "kidnapping," "shooting innocent people," and repeatedly commit [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | crime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. A critical observation is that these criminals are often "treated like ordinary people" and can even "get shot in the head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, implying a breakdown in due process or consequences.

### Specific Events and Police Involvement

The narrative points to a significant incident where a "big disease was looted" a day prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. There is also a mention of "harassment of opposition MLA brother" where a video was recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The presence of a "special judge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> indicates formal [[police_involvement_and_legal_proceedings | legal proceedings]].

A specific example of a kidnapping is detailed, where the speaker and friends started a company, were kidnapped, and this continued for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Critiques of Police Effectiveness and Justice

The [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues | police department]] is frequently criticized for its perceived failures. The speaker states that the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues | police]] "failed" to resolve the kidnapping case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, although it was eventually "solved on Wednesday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues | police]] reportedly "waived off the robbery charges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, leading to the company's closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

This closure, the speaker suggests, forced individuals into [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | criminal]] actions, leading to the "robbery" of a "big Amma" as there was "no other way left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. This implies a cycle where police ineffectiveness or policy contributes to further [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | crime]].

There is strong sentiment expressed against the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues | police]], with statements like, "today you people are venting your anger on the police" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The speaker suggests that the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues | police]] are "looking for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### Corruption and Persecution

The speaker indicates that the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues | police]] created "terror at gunpoint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> and will "have to suffer the consequences for the wrong done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. The speaker, once famous as a "liminal" (criminal) in the city, felt that the [[police_and_law_enforcement_issues | police]] could not catch them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, highlighting a sense of impunity or a perceived inability of law enforcement to act effectively.

A significant challenge arises when the individual discovers that someone close, "Monica," whom they considered an "elder sister," betrayed them "because of the greed for a few rupees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This suggests that betrayal and internal corruption further complicate the landscape of [[crime_and_corruption | crime]] and [[policing_and_justice_in_the_context_of_crime | justice]].

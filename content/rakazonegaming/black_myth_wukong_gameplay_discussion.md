## Gameplay and Player Performance
The stream primarily featured [[game_commentary]] and [[player_performance_analysis]].

Player challenges included:
*   Difficulty with dodging attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:16">[03:23:16]</a>.
*   Issues with stamina management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   Struggling to defeat various bosses and enemies, including a "Tiger boss" that took three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

*   Discussions about needing specific resistances (e.g., 350 burn resistance) for certain encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:30">[02:53:30]</a>.

The streamer also discussed upgrading "armorer" sets to improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:35">[02:29:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:34">[03:34:34]</a> and increasing stamina and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:55">[03:42:55]</a>.

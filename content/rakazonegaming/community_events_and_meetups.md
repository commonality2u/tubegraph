A significant [[gaming_community_events_and_esports | meetup]] is scheduled to take place in Delhi on September 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

The meetup is not just a gathering; it will also feature a [[gaming_community_events_and_esports | community tournament]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Participants will have the chance to win prize money and various goodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Prizes
Attendees at the Delhi meetup are encouraged to participate in a special challenge: beating the host's record in a racing game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

The first five individuals who successfully beat the record will receive cash prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>.

This challenge stems from the host's performance in a recent streamer showdown, which impressed MSI enough to send a new laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:20">[03:40:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:31">[03:40:31]</a>. The host plans to unbox this new MSI laptop after completing their current [[events_and_activities_within_the_gta_rp_server | GTA RP stream]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

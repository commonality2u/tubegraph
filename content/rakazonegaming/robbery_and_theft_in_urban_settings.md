Another person shares a past experience, saying, "I used to get robbed a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The possibility of being robbed in the present is also directly acknowledged, with a speaker noting, "yes of course you can rob me right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

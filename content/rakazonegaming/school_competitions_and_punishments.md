"School Let's Go" is a show where favorite creators participate in a [[school_memories_and_class_experiences | school test]], with one passing and one failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This particular episode features guests Sakshi and Mili, both from Mumbai and best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Guests' Educational Backgrounds
Mili graduated and then pursued an interest in fashion for three years after clearing her 12th grade, alongside completing a B.Com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. She later entered the [[gaming_community_events_and_esports | gaming industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Sakshi completed her MBA in Marketing from Collier Bandra under significant pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. She also engaged in content creation, YouTube, and Instagram alongside her [[educational_qualifications_and_college_placement_experiences | marketing-related studies]] at Reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## Competition Format
The [[streamer_challenges_and_competitions | competition]] awards one point for every correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. No points are deducted for wrong answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. The participant with the highest points will advance in the [[streamer_challenges_and_competitions | competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

### Quiz Questions
The "school test" involves [[quiz_questions_related_to_school_subjects | general knowledge questions]]. Sakshi's preferred subject in school or college was English, where she achieved the highest marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Mili's favorite subject was Geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

Examples of [[trivia_and_general_knowledge_contests | trivia questions]] asked include:
*   "Which city was the capital of India?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>
*   "Where is the body of Shah Jahan kept?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>
*   "Which animal sleeps with one eye open?" (Answer: Dolphin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>
*   "Which touch is a western part of India?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>
*   A question about types of adult teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   "Where is the next Olympics happening?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>

## Funny School Memories and Punishments

### Hair Oiling Rules
Sakshi recounted a common rule in her school where teachers would check if students had oil in their hair, especially during the first period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. Girls would often try to hide their dry hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. A specific punishment for students who didn't apply oil involved having a small bottle of oil poured over their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. This was considered a [[school_memories_and_class_experiences | punishment]] to ensure the rule was followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. Mili shared a similar experience, where students who hadn't applied oil or tied their hair with a ribbon (which was compulsory) would have oil applied to their heads by prefects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

### Traumatic Drawing Competition Incident
Mili shared a [[school_memories_and_class_experiences | traumatic memory]] from third standard related to a [[streamer_challenges_and_competitions | rangoli competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. She was good at drawing and came second or third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. However, she forgot her colors at the competition venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. When her father couldn't find them and they were confirmed stolen, he slapped her in front of the entire school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.

### Monday Tests and Evasion Tactics
Another memory involved strict "Monday tests" in their school, where one or two chapters for each subject were tested every week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. A specific "temple copy" had to be bought separately for these tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. Students, especially those involved in [[gaming_community_events_and_esports | sports]], often forgot to buy or bring these copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. The school bookshop only opened after the test started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

Students developed [[virtual_challenges_and_antics | evasion tactics]]:
*   They would tear pages from their test copies after getting results signed by parents and throw them in a "junk" pile, then retrieve fresh pages from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.
*   In one instance, a friend who was late for a test and couldn't find his copy hid atop a cupboard to avoid detection from teachers and even the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. This demonstrated the unity among friends to help each other avoid [[criminal_activities_and_consequences | consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>.

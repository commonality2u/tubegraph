### Giveaways
While no giveaway was planned for the current stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, future streams will feature giveaways of various [[ingame_items_and_trading | skins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   These giveaways are exclusively for those who register using the provided link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

*   The streamer also has the ability to transfer any unboxed skins directly into their personal inventory on the Hellcase website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   Giveaways will be held tomorrow, and users can register to participate for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:17">[02:12:17]</a>.
*   There is a dedicated giveaway section on the website where users can check ongoing giveaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:21">[02:16:21]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Case Opening
The streamer recounts a past experience where they obtained a skin worth $1.50 from a case, then used that to open two more cases, yielding another $1.50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. They then "got a bit greedy" and opened another case, resulting in a skin that returned their initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Live Case Unboxing
During the stream, the host opens several cases on Hellcase, aiming for profitable [[ingame_items_and_trading | skins]] and upgrades, often targeting high-value items like knives and gloves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   The "Black Friday" sale is currently active on Hellcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:21">[01:57:21]</a>.
*   They open a "Glock 18 Gamma Two" case, which has a 0.01% chance of dropping a rare item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:37">[01:57:37]</a>.
*   The streamer discusses various case types, including "Collector Cases," "Over Pass Collection," and "Indian cases" like "Lotus Dream," "Sun God," and "Crown Treasure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:42">[02:06:42]</a>.
*   They aim for "profit" in their unboxings, noting when they achieve it or incur a "loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:17">[02:00:17]</a>.
*   The option to "upgrade" skins for a chance at a higher-tier item is explored, with probabilities like "45% chance" being mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:23">[02:02:23]</a>.
*   The goal is to unbox skins that can be used for future giveaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:15">[02:12:15]</a>.
*   The final unboxings involve trying to obtain a "good agent" skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:59">[02:14:59]</a>.

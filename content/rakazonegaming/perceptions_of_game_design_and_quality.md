A direct commentary on game quality suggests that certain games are perceived as "very bad" and should not be created in their current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. The speaker expresses a strong negative opinion on a specific game, indicating dissatisfaction with its design or execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

The discussion also briefly touches upon specific in-game elements or mechanics, with a mention of "payment found its lines in this game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. This suggests that the integration of payment systems or other structural elements within a game can influence player perception and contribute to the overall quality assessment.

> [!info] Ankita's McDonald's Escape
Ankita recalled a time during a science exhibition at another school when she ran away to eat at McDonald's with her school boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Her father had called to say there was no food at home and suggested McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Despite the teacher's refusal to let them leave, Ankita and her boyfriend crossed the road to catch a rickshaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. They managed to get into a rickshaw and pass their teachers who were waving for them to stop, waving back at them as they left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. They went to McDonald's, ate, and returned to an empty school before heading home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The next day, her vice-principal called her father about the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

> [!info] The Window Escape
Another guest described a plan to escape school through a damaged window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. A friend with "very good strength" gradually damaged a railing near their sitting area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. After ensuring the school didn't check the railing upon leaving, they tried to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The guest was the first to successfully escape through the window, leading to a series of similar escapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. However, they were eventually caught, and "a big action was taken against" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

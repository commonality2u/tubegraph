### Currency and Economy

In the city, players have access to various forms of currency and a functioning economy. A player noted having 41,000 rupees since the server's inception, suggesting accumulated wealth from prior activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Despite this, it was stated that "you don't need money to play" in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, indicating that gameplay is not solely reliant on financial accumulation.

A specific task involved going to Pacific Bank and paying 20,000 in PayPal currency, alongside a transaction of one lakh dollars, with the promise of "a lot of stuff" in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Discussions around selling items, with the phrase "sell send it very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a> and mentions of a "price" to be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>, further highlight the presence of an ingame market. The group pooled money for a transaction, with one player contributing 70,000 and another 30,000 to reach a total of one lakh dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.

It was also noted that some players might need to accumulate funds, as one player had only 5,000 dollars despite spending all day in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.

### Trading and Tasks

Trading involves both items and services. A task given to players involved paying a large sum of money (one lakh dollars) to receive "a lot of stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Another [[game_tasks_and_ingame_interactions | task]] involved dealing with a "hostess" situation in Gokuldham society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. There were also negotiations for releasing a hostage in exchange for help with a "friend stuck in customs" needing a passport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>, highlighting illegal activities and a favor system.

The concept of a "75-day challenge" was briefly mentioned in relation to items, possibly indicating a long-term goal for acquiring or maintaining items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

### Server and Item Issues

[[technical_issues_and_ingame_dynamics | Server issues]] were acknowledged as affecting the availability or use of items, including "didos" attacks causing glitches and disconnections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:31">[02:37:31]</a>. One character noted that a "glitch is happening" with "love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>, suggesting a bug affecting game elements. Frequent restarts were also mentioned, possibly due to stability issues affecting items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. These technical problems can disrupt gameplay and the normal flow of ingame activities and trading.

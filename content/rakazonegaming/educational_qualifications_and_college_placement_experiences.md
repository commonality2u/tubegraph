The "School Chale Hum" series features creators and YouTubers to explore their [[schooling_experiences_of_creators_and_youtubers | schooling experiences]] and how much they studied in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The inaugural episode brings in two creators to discuss their [[educational_background_of_guests | educational qualifications]] and career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Guests' Educational Journey

One guest shared their [[educational_background_of_guests | educational journey]], stating they completed English medium schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. They mentioned attending Mount Carmel School, Anand Niketan, and later a school referred to as Mount Karma, listing them among the "best schools in Delhi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Challenges in Subject Choices
A guest's father desired for them to pursue science until 10th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. However, they were unable to secure a science stream after 10th grade because they achieved 75% in their 10th-grade examinations, necessitating a school change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This individual later received only five marks in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, which led to them being "pushed into commerce" for 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### College Admissions
After studying commerce, the guest struggled to gain admission to college, having secured only 49.9% in 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Despite this, they eventually secured admission to Bhartiya Vidyapeeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. One participant also mentioned securing a job through the sports category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Job and College Placement
One guest's job was obtained through a college placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. They undertook the interview themselves and completed it "off campus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The discussion highlighted the importance of working hard on one's [[educational_background_of_guests | educational qualification]] to succeed in college placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

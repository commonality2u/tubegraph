The protagonist describes a venture where they took ownership of machines, aiming to make a name for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The casino itself was a significant source of "name, success and fame" for the protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Leasing and Control
The protagonist later took the casino on lease, which revealed many internal secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. During a major incident, the protagonist's group gained control of the casino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Public Perception vs. Hidden Function
While the public perceives a casino simply as a gambling place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, it serves a deeper, hidden purpose for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The casino functions as a "pan vault" where the black money of numerous ministers is stored and converted into white money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Risks and Complications
Involvement with the casino brought severe risks, including the protagonist being kidnapped and forced to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The casino became the center of a major incident, leading to it being surrounded by the entire police department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, and becoming a significant news story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The illicit activities involving black money meant that the government would not easily surrender their hidden wealth, leading to potential confrontations with the city's entire police force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Lessons Learned
Despite the challenges, the protagonist reflects that owning a casino, or starting a company, doesn't matter as much as the lessons learned from problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. The experience taught that problems must be faced, not fled from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

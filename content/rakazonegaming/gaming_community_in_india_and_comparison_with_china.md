The [[gaming_culture_and_community_in_india|gaming community in India]] is currently noted to be similar to its past state, with calls for the country to learn from China's advancements in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Comparison with China
Historically, China held the largest market for mobile gaming and was a significant consumer of gaming content until or before the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Currently, China ranks second on Steam, whereas India's Steam user base is significantly smaller, possibly not even reaching a million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

China has also shown capabilities in game development, exemplified by titles like "Black Myth Wang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. In terms of popular PC games, a comparison of Valorant's launch and esports standing in India versus China highlights India's significant lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Challenges for the Indian Gaming Community
### Lack of AAA Game Audience
India currently lacks a substantial audience and player base for AAA (triple-A) games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Need for Diversification
The growth of [[gaming_in_indian_community|gaming in the Indian community]] is hampered by a lack of diverse options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. For the industry to flourish, there needs to be:
*   Massive esports presence across multiple games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   More games for people to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   More brands willing to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

A monopoly in any sector hinders development, and variety is crucial for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

### Parental Understanding and Career Paths
Many parents in India may not fully understand or support gaming as a viable career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that individuals interested in a [[gaming_community_interactions|gaming career]] must educate their parents about the various earning opportunities in esports and assure them that studies will not be neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### Financial Barriers
Acquiring gaming equipment can be a financial challenge for some, but the speaker suggests options like EMI or earning money through tuitions, creating assignments, or online freelancing by learning necessary skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The speaker is hopeful for future improvements in the [[building_a_gaming_community_in_india|Indian gaming scene]] and anticipates bringing new developments by next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Low-end mobile gaming is identified as a potential "next big thing" for streamers and creators in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

### Popular Games and eSports Discussions
Discussions revolve around several popular games for potential tournaments:
*   **Counter-Strike (CS)**: There's a strong interest in holding CS tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, with a particular focus on case openings and giveaways, like an AWP Gungnir skin worth $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The streamer notes that while CS is trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, its viewership is not as high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **PUBG**: Organising PUBG tournaments is explicitly stated to be difficult due to cash prize mentions or potential strikes related to developers like Riot and Kraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Despite this, there's a past attempt to "revive PUBG a bit" among streamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Valorant**: Similar to PUBG, Valorant tournaments with cash prizes are not feasible due to potential strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Grand Theft Auto (GTA) Roleplay (RP)**: There's a strong preference for GTA eSports over CS, with the streamer stating "GTA Sports Will Be Better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. The streamer expresses readiness to talk to the "Tao server" for setting up tournaments with prize money and casting them on their channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The content itself often involves [[Cultural references in Indian gaming videos | role-playing scenarios]], including interactions with police officers, discussions about criminal activities like store robberies and underground racing, and even elaborate "recovery" schemes involving large sums of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.

### Tournament Logistics and Challenges
Organizing tournaments, especially with cash prizes, presents challenges:
*   **Game Licensing**: The streamer notes that specific games like PUBG require permission from their developers (Riot/Kraft) to host tournaments, which is not easily obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Platform Restrictions**: Integrating cash prizes directly into streams or certain games can lead to strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Community Interest**: While some games like CS are popular, their viewership for tournaments might be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, impacting engagement.
*   **Server Administration**: Ensuring active and well-managed game servers is crucial for smooth gameplay and content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. The need for administrators ("admin active in the server") is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

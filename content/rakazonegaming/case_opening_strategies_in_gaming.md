During gaming live streams, players engage in various [[game_strategies_and_tactics | strategies]] and rituals when opening cases, particularly in games like CS2. These are often rooted in community beliefs, personal superstitions, and observations rather than confirmed game mechanics.

## Common Case Opening Strategies and Beliefs

*   **Quantity Over Quality**
    *   The streamer noted that opening 5 out of 500 cases yields a 0.1% success rate for desired items like "gold" (rare skins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Despite opening over 140 cases, no "reds" (very rare items) were obtained, indicating a low probability for high-tier items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:42">[03:32:42]</a>. After opening more than 300 cases, the streamer stated, "We haven't got a single gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:25">[03:36:25]</a>.
    *   There was a belief that a certain number of cases, possibly around 350, might guarantee a gold item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:24">[02:27:24]</a>.

*   **Luck and Manifestation**
    *   A prevailing belief is that "luck" plays a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>.
    *   Players attempt to "manifest" desired outcomes, such as a "Butterfly Gamma Doppler" by repeatedly chanting its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.
    *   Some suggest focusing positivity in the chat to influence outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.

*   **Rituals and Superstitions**
    *   **Clicking the box vs. key:** One strategy involved clicking the key into the box instead of the box itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:19">[03:52:19]</a>.
    *   **Mouse and Keyboard Interaction:**
        *   Suggestions included removing the mouse to influence the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a> and quickly pressing 'escape' to cancel animations, which some believed could influence the item revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
        *   A specific ritual involved holding the mouse in a particular way or performing actions like "hitting the buffalo's eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:21">[03:41:21]</a>.
    *   **Physical Actions:**
        *   Opening boxes while standing on one leg was suggested as a way to "manifest" luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:09">[03:30:09]</a>.
        *   Dancing on knees or other physical movements were also attempted to influence drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>.
    *   **Naming Conventions:** Naming boxes after popular figures or "goats" (greatest of all time) was also a practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:06]</a>. This extends to personal connections, such as naming a box after an ex to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:06">[03:51:09]</a>.

*   **Emotional Investment**
    *   Streamers and chat participants express heightened emotions, from excitement at potential "gold" drops to frustration and sadness when desired items don't appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. The belief in a "curse" on case openings is common, requiring specific actions to "break" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:59]</a>.

## Community Interaction and Influence

*   The [[gaming_community_interactions | gaming community interactions]] heavily influence case opening decisions, with chat members constantly suggesting strategies, specific cases to open, and expressing collective desires for "gold" items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   Chat suggestions and community consensus often drive the streamer's next action, demonstrating the interactive nature of [[community_engagement_in_gaming | community engagement in gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.
*   Donations and "Super Chats" from viewers, sometimes accompanied by specific requests, further shape the live stream's course and the [[ingame_events_and_strategies | ingame events and strategies]] pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Unproven Theories

*   **"Glitch Case":** The idea of a "glitch case" suggests that certain cases might have a higher probability of yielding rare items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>.
*   **Game Restart:** Restarting the game was believed to potentially improve luck, akin to a "soft reset" of the underlying probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:48">[03:17:50]</a>.
*   **"Blink if you're in danger"**: A repeated phrase suggesting a magical or superstitious action to influence the drop, often performed by the streamer on cue from the chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:01">[03:41:03]</a>.

Ultimately, while many [[online_gaming_strategies | online gaming strategies]] and superstitions are employed, the stream acknowledges the inherent randomness of case openings. Despite significant investment (over 250 cases opened, with an estimated cost of over 1.5 lakhs rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>), desirable "gold" items remained elusive, leading to expressions of disappointment among participants.

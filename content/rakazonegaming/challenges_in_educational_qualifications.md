The "School Chale Hum" series features YouTubers discussing their [[schooling_experiences_of_youtube_creators | schooling experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, including the academic paths they took and the challenges they faced in obtaining educational qualifications.

## Educational Backgrounds and Initial Hurdles
Guests shared their initial academic details, with one having attended an English medium school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Discussions also touched upon the importance of working hard on one's educational qualifications for securing jobs, particularly through college placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. One guest mentioned attending Mount Carmel School, noted as one of the "best schools in Delhi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Academic Performance and Stream Selection
Several challenges were highlighted regarding academic performance and its impact on [[school_subject_choices_and_their_impacts | subject choices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:
*   **Difficulty in Science Stream**
    One guest struggled to get admission into the science stream after 10th grade, despite achieving 75% marks. This performance was deemed insufficient for science, leading to a school change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Low Marks and Forced Stream Change**
    Another guest recounted scoring only five marks in science, which resulted in being "pushed into commerce" for 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This highlights how academic results can significantly restrict [[school_subject_choices_and_their_impacts | educational pathways]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Post-School Admission Struggles
The challenges continued post-12th grade, as one guest was unable to secure admission into any college after scoring only 49.9% in commerce in 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This low percentage in commerce posed a significant hurdle for further academic pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Alternative Paths to Education and Employment
Despite academic setbacks, some guests found alternative routes for admission and employment:
*   **Bhartiya Vidyapeeth Admission**
    One guest eventually secured admission into Bhartiya Vidyapeeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Sports Category Job**
    Another guest obtained a job through a sports category, demonstrating that pathways other than purely academic qualifications can lead to employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

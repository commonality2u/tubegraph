The role of a private detective exists within [[grand_theft_auto_5_roleplay | Grand Theft Auto 5 Roleplay]] environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. These characters are involved in investigative activities and can be hired for various purposes within the game's narrative.

## Noted Private Detectives
A specific private detective character named "Neeraj" is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. There appears to be some uncertainty regarding his full name or details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Hiring and Secrecy
The topic of hiring private detectives is discussed, with questions raised about whether a "state" entity within the game had hired any <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. There is also an implication that players may be secretive about their use or hiring of private detectives, suggesting a hidden aspect to their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Investigative Tools
While not explicitly stated to be used by a private detective in this segment, an RF (radio frequency) scanner is demonstrated as a tool that can "find out the frequency of anyone's radio without me knowing their radio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This device can identify specific radio frequencies, such as those between 730-760 or 190-210, for a player's radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Such a tool could be valuable for investigative [[gta_5_roleplay_experience | roleplaying scenarios]] where tracking or eavesdropping is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

The [[personal_journey_and_challenges | personal journey]] of an individual can begin with aspirations far exceeding their financial reality, where a "dream was so big but my income was so small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, and even a meager $100 could not be earned for a prolonged period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Identifying Opportunity and Starting a Business

The protagonist observed the apparent ease of earning money in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This realization led to the arrangement of some investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> and the establishment of a finance company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. The company was founded on the principle of securing clients' money and providing it when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, promising to "double your money day and quadruple it night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## Business Challenges and Downfall

The entrepreneurial venture soon faced severe obstacles, highlighting the inherent [[challenges_of_ingame_teamwork_and_strategy | challenges of ingame teamwork and strategy]] and the volatile nature of business, particularly when dealing with illicit activities.

### Threats and Coercion
The protagonist found themselves in a "bad condition" at [[police_and_legal_system_challenges | police checkpoints]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, facing threats such as having "2MG is pointed at your head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. There were instances of extortion, with demands to "open the total loot in the front in the list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Police Inaction
Repeated complaints to the [[police_and_legal_system_challenges | police]] were made, but they were "repeatedly ignored" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, suggesting a lack of support or protection from authorities.

### Criminal Involvement and Scams
The finance company faced accusations of being a "scam and bogus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. It was described as a "Liquid Investment and Banking Company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a> with connections to "obscene people of the crime world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, including figures like Badshah Singh Parmar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Criminals were reported to be forming organizations together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Company Destruction
The ultimate challenge came when the business was directly attacked:
> "when I reached office, my company was destroyed in front of everyone in 2 minutes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

This destruction left the protagonist with a "blood... boiling in revenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, underscoring the profound impact of such business failures.

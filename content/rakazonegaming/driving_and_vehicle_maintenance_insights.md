## Vehicle Features and Specifications

The discussion frequently references a Mercedes car, which is described as a high-quality vehicle that was purchased new, not second-hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The car's cost was approximately 85 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Despite being washed, a black car tends to show dust easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

*   The car's voice assistant, "Hey Mercedes," can answer questions and interact with the driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.

### Performance
The car gives an average of 14-15 km/l on the highway and around 13 km/l in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 6 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:06">[03:09:06]</a>. The vehicle's top speed has been tested at 160 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:36">[01:38:36]</a>. The car has good ground clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:36">[01:40:36]</a>.

## Vehicle Maintenance and Services
The car has a 5-year, one-time service package that costs around â‚¹40,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:02">[03:08:02]</a>. A notable feature is the call button which directly connects to the head office or maintenance team if the car is turned off or experiences an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:23">[03:08:23]</a>. This service includes towing and arranging travel or accommodation for the owner if the car breaks down far from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:36">[03:08:36]</a>. As of the stream, this specific feature has never been needed due to an accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:13">[03:19:13]</a>.

The car has a low mileage of 9,500 km after one year, attributed to the owner's busy schedule and hospital stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. The car has also had its PPF (Paint Protection Film) done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:53">[03:14:53]</a>.

## Driving Experiences and Challenges
The driver describes themselves as driving carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:21">[02:04:21]</a>. However, they express caution regarding electric rickshaws (Temo) and bikers, describing them as driving recklessly and posing a danger on the roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:50">[03:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:50">[03:06:50]</a>. They also mention that auto drivers in India tend to stop abruptly without warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:21">[03:03:21]</a>.

Driving in India can be challenging due to high traffic, especially in Gurgaon, where it's difficult to test a car's speed capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. There's a rule in India that prohibits changing the car's paint or applying vinyl without updating the RC (Registration Certificate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>.

### Parking and Roadside Incidents
The driver recounts an incident where their previous i20 car was towed because it was parked in a "no parking" zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>. They clarify that the car was parked on an inner street, not a busy main road, and they did not notice the "no parking" sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:11">[02:08:11]</a>.

## Future Plans for Content
The streamers are looking for a content house to stream from, specifically a 2 BHK with a modular kitchen and a hall suitable for watch parties and cooking streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>. They are looking for ideas for future IRL (In-Real-Life) streams, including visiting "hated places" or haunted locations, though they acknowledge the challenges of privacy and faking reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>.

They are also considering [[exploring_business_ideas_and_investments | business ideas]] like indoor cricket arenas (turf) and liquor shops, noting the high profit margins in the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:23">[02:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:39">[02:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:56">[02:47:56]</a>.

The team plans to upgrade their camera setup for better quality IRL streams, moving from phone cameras to DSR cameras with gimbals and 5G routers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:03">[02:09:03]</a>. They aim for a setup similar to that used by iShowSpeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:46">[01:54:46]</a>.

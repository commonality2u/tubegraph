The importance of [[social_interactions_and_relationships | social interaction]] and open conversation is a recurring theme. There is an observation that "no one has come to talk to the people in the city" nowadays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This lack of connection can lead to feelings of loneliness, which is identified as a mental illness rather than a physical disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. A key indicator of this issue is that "no one asked how are you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Fostering Connection
To address the prevalent mental distress, a system has been established where subscribers can "share their pain and suffering" and questions can be asked through conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The goal is to provide a platform for people to express themselves, transforming negativity into positivity through listening and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Direct Engagement
Calls are made to encourage direct [[social_interactions_and_relationships | social interaction]], such as inviting people to "come here everyone come" to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. There is also an emphasis on facilitating connections by offering contact information to "meet such people better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Customs and Gestures
In some [[social_interactions_and_relationships | social interactions]], specific traditions are observed, such as gifting something "whenever we meet a beautiful girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This highlights how conversations can be accompanied by social customs that enhance the interaction.

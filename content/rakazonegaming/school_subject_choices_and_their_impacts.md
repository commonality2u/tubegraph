The "School Chale Hum" series explores the [[schooling_experiences_of_youtube_creators | schooling experiences]] of creators, including their academic paths and how much they studied in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The series aims to delve into their [[school_experiences_and_memories | memories from school days]] and the impact of their [[indian_education_system | educational qualifications]] on their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Educational Background and Subject Choices

One guest, Team, shares that he attended an English medium school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, specifically mentioning Mount Carmel School and Anand Niketan, which he describes as among the "best schools in Delhi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. He also recalls a unique [[favourite_school_subjects_and_learning_experiences | learning experience]] where he studied English with a Sanskrit teacher, noting the strictness involved in English instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The guest's father wished for him to pursue science up to the 10th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, he was unable to take science after the 10th grade because he scored 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This percentage was seemingly insufficient for the science stream at his then-current school, necessitating a school change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Another guest claimed an 89% score in 10th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Challenges in Subject Pursuit

Despite his father's wish, the guest had to take commerce in 12th grade because he received only five marks in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This low science score essentially "pushed him into commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Academic Performance and Consequences

After studying commerce, the guest faced further [[challenges_in_educational_qualifications | challenges in educational qualifications]] when he could not gain admission to a desired institution because he scored only 49.9% in his 12th-grade commerce exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. He eventually secured admission to Bhartiya Vidyapeeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, and even secured a job through the sports category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## General Knowledge and Its Reflection

The series also includes a [[school_competitions_and_testing_formats | competition format]] where guests answer general knowledge questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The questions cover a range of subjects, including:

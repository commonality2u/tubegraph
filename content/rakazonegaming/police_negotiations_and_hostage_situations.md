During a significant incident at a casino, the police department surrounded the building as a hostage situation unfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32">[07:32]</a>. The perpetrators had taken people inside the casino hostage, with some of them being friends of the main character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>.

## Initial Demands and Threats

Police officers instructed the perpetrators to release the hostages and surrender quietly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37">[07:37]</a>. In response, the criminals threatened to shoot one of the hostages first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46">[07:46]</a>. They demonstrated awareness of the police presence, stating there were at least 50 officers inside and police forces deployed at all casino doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48">[07:48]</a>. The perpetrators issued a severe threat: if police attempted to break in, the entire casino would be blown up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>.

A hostage, Mr. Howrey, pleaded with the officers to cooperate, receiving reassurance that they would all come out safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01">[08:01]</a>. However, the perpetrators reiterated their demand for police cooperation, threatening to shoot all hostages inside if their instructions were not followed quietly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11">[08:11]</a>.

The criminals' primary demand was 5 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22">[08:22]</a>. Police agreed to arrange the 5 million dollars within five hours, emphasizing that nothing should happen to the hostesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22">[08:22]</a>. The perpetrators demanded a pass, threatening to injure an "Australian person" if there was any delay in its delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29">[08:29]</a>.

## The Motive and Anticipated Response

The criminals revealed their true motive for the casino takeover: to steal black money belonging to government ministers, which was being converted into white money through the casino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04">[10:04]</a>. They recognized that the government would not easily surrender this money due to its illicit nature, which they could not disclose to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23">[10:23]</a>. Therefore, they anticipated a strong response, including the deployment of the city's entire force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33">[10:33]</a>.

## Police Assessment and Challenges

The police confirmed the high-risk situation, noting 50 people inside the casino and the perpetrators' demand for 5 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40">[10:40]</a>. The criminals had planted C-4 explosives at all casino entrances and had three cargo buffers, making escape difficult for both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48">[10:48]</a>. Hostesses were being moved deeper into the casino, making internal access for police difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59">[10:59]</a>. This situation led police to consider the need for an independent force to rescue the hostages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07">[11:07]</a>.

## Escalation and Public Perception

News channels widely reported the "casino high news," portraying the perpetrators as terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14">[12:14]</a>. The criminals aimed to waste as much [[police_procedures_and_courtroom_drama | police time]] as possible, believing it would benefit their plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29">[20:29]</a>.

## Escape and Aftermath

Ultimately, the money was transferred to the bank as requested by the criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53">[20:53]</a>. The perpetrators executed their escape plan, utilizing a helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54">[27:54]</a>. They challenged the government directly, believing the government would not back down due to their unlimited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35">[27:35]</a>. They managed to escape and disappear into the night, having defrauded the country of 100 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:59">[28:59]</a>. The criminals viewed their actions as a lesson for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28">[33:28]</a>.

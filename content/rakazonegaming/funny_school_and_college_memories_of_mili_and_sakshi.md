In episode 4 of the "School Chale Hum" series, guests Sakshi and Mili shared some of their most memorable, and sometimes funny, experiences from their school and college days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Sakshi's School and College Anecdotes

### The "Oil in Hair" Rule
Sakshi recalled a strict rule in her school where teachers would check for oil in students' hair during the morning assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. If a girl's hair was seen as "completely dry," they would be called forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The punishment involved a small oil bottle from the cupboard being poured over the student's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This was considered a punishment for not adhering to the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### The Traumatizing Rangoli Competition
Sakshi shared a "traumatizing" incident from when she was in third standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Being good at drawing from childhood, she participated in a rangoli competition and secured second or third place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. However, she forgot all her rangoli colors at the competition site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. When her father, an artist who taught her drawing, asked about the colors, and they were found to be stolen, he slapped her in front of the entire school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Mili's School Anecdotes

### Enforcing the "Oil in Hair" Rule
Mili was a "fan" (monitor or prefect) in her school and was responsible for checking discipline, including the "oil in hair" rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Long hair needed to be tied, and oil was compulsory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. If a student hadn't applied oil or tied their hair with a ribbon, Mili would take oil and apply it on their head as punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. She even recalled chasing a girl who didn't wear oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### The Monday Test "Temple Copy" Saga
Mili's school had mandatory tests every Monday, covering one or two chapters for different subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. These tests required a special "temple copy" that had to be bought separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. As Mili was involved in sports, she often forgot to bring or buy the copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The school bookstore would only open after the test started, making it difficult to get one on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

Students would tear pages from their old test copies (after showing results to parents and teachers) and keep them in their bags to avoid trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. One time, a friend arrived late for the test at 8:05 and couldn't find his copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. He climbed onto a cupboard to hide when the teacher and principal entered the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Remarkably, despite being seen, neither the principal nor the teacher reacted, and the friend jumped down after they left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Mili highlighted the unity among friends during such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

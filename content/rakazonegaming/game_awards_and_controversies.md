During a recent live stream, the topic of game awards and the controversies surrounding them was discussed, particularly focusing on the "Game of the Year" award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Game of the Year Discrepancy
The main point of contention revolved around [[games_and_gaming_references | Astro Bot]] winning "Game of the Year" over [[games_and_gaming_references | Wukong]] (also referred to as [[games_and_gaming_references | Wang]] or [[games_and_gaming_references | Wakang]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The speaker expressed disbelief at this outcome, questioning how [[games_and_gaming_references | Astro Bot]] could win against [[games_and_gaming_references | Wukong]], especially when [[games_and_gaming_references | Elden Ring]] and its DLC were also in consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

The speaker suggested that the decision-making process for these awards might be influenced by factors other than merit, such as financial considerations or an attempt to appease certain segments of the [[gaming_community_culture_and_commentary | gaming community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>:
> "bro this award and l shut i rid as [ __ ] bhaiya it's all i don't know how they decide b it seems like this to me it seems real No, it means that we decide like this brother keep some part happy or else it Like money, I don't know brother, there is some scene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

This sentiment highlights a common [[controversies_and_online_drama | controversy]] in the [[gaming_community_culture_and_commentary | gaming industry]] regarding the transparency and fairness of award decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Player Base and Sales Comparison
To support their argument against [[games_and_gaming_references | Astro Bot]]'s win, the speaker referenced player base and sales figures:
*   [[games_and_gaming_references | Wukong]] had an "all time peak" player base of 2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   [[games_and_gaming_references | Astro Bot]] had sold 1.5 million copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Despite these figures suggesting a larger player base for [[games_and_gaming_references | Wukong]], the speaker stated that "more kids played [[games_and_gaming_references | Astro Butt]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, contributing to the confusion and frustration regarding the award outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The speaker woke up surprised by the news of [[games_and_gaming_references | Astro Bot]] winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Justification of Award Decision
A user in the chat attempted to justify [[games_and_gaming_references | Astro Bot]]'s win by suggesting its mechanics were better than [[games_and_gaming_references | Wukong]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>. However, the speaker strongly disagreed, having played both games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>, and felt the justification was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. This highlights different perspectives on [[gaming_achievements_and_milestones | game quality]] and what constitutes a "Game of the Year" winner.

The conversation underscores the ongoing [[controversies_and_online_drama | controversies and online drama]] that can arise within the [[gaming_community_culture_and_commentary | gaming community]] regarding prestigious awards, often leading to [[gaming_commentary_and_discussions | discussions]] about perceived biases, influence, and the subjective nature of judging games.

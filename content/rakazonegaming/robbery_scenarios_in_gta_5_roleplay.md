[[Grand Theft Auto 5 Roleplay|Grand Theft Auto 5 Roleplay]] (GTA 5 RP) often features intricate [[robbery_planning_and_execution_in_gta_5_rp|robbery scenarios]] that involve specific team compositions, target amounts, and strategic tools. These scenarios contribute to dynamic and unpredictable [[gta_5_rp_gameplay_and_roleplaying_scenarios|gameplay and roleplaying scenarios]].

## Robber Group Size
A common setup for a robbery involves a group of four individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This size can influence the complexity of the operation and the division of tasks among the players.

## Target Amount
In one instance, the target amount for a robbery was stated as one million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. There was a discussion questioning if the four robbers had ever collectively seen such a large sum before attempting to steal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. In a different context, a smaller amount of two thousand was also mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Tools and Tactics
A crucial tool utilized in a [[successful_robbery_strategies_in_gta_5_rp|robbery strategy]] is an RF (radio frequency) scanner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This device allows players to discover the frequency of another person's radio without prior knowledge of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. During an operation, two frequencies were identified: one between 730 and 760, and another between 190 and 210 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The scanner can precisely identify a specific radio's frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Urgency and Police Presence
A recurring element in these scenarios is the imminent arrival of the police, creating a sense of urgency for the robbers to complete their task quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

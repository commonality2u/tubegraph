### Character Conflicts and Threats

Several characters are embroiled in conflicts:

*   **Tillu**: Described as a "terrorist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:27">[02:10:27]</a> and "Most Wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:27">[02:04:27]</a>. Tillu is accused of shooting someone's sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a> and has made threats to kill the speaker and their sister, Chiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:34">[01:46:34]</a>. Tillu is currently "hidden in the bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>, making him hard to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:33">[02:27:33]</a>.
*   **Martin**: Another major antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. He is accused of kidnapping Hindvi ji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. Martin's associates are also threatening the main character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. There's a desire to obtain guns from Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
*   **Stephen De Luca**: Along with his gang, Stephen is also a source of conflict and threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:51">[03:57:51]</a>.

## [[Game Strategies and Tactics | Strategic Approaches]]

Players discuss various [[gameplay strategy and secrets | strategies]] to navigate these conflicts and achieve their objectives.

### Dealing with Enemies

The primary strategy for dealing with Tillu and others is direct confrontation: "whoever is seen will get beaten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. There's a strong desire to "kill Tillu wherever I see him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a> and to "make him a licking head by beating him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>.

> "Tell him wherever you see Pillu, tell him He will get beaten up just by licking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:14">[02:41:14]</a>

This aggressive stance is highlighted by the statement: "I will beat Tillu a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Collaboration and Information Gathering

Players seek alliances and information to counter threats:

*   **Seeking help from Mufasa ji**: Considered a "power backup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a> and a potential source of protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.
*   **Information from Police**: The protagonist has a good relationship with Officer Rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:52">[02:04:52]</a>, who is involved in an operation to catch Tillu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:58">[02:04:58]</a>. Information is exchanged, including Tillu's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:28">[01:51:28]</a>.
*   **Tracking and trapping**: There is a plan to "catch him 10 minute time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a> and use a two-door car to block escape routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:46">[02:53:46]</a>.

### Money and [[Ingame items and trading | Item Acquisition]]

*   **Gun License**: Obtaining a gun license costs 50,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. The character plans to get money from Dominic for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>.
*   **Robbing**: To gain money, the plan is to "catch two rich people and them You have to rob yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.

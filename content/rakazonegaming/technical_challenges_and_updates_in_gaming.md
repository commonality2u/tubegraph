## In-Game Technical Issues and Troubleshooting
Players frequently encounter [[technical_issues_in_gaming_and_troubleshooting | technical issues]] that disrupt gameplay. Common problems include game servers not working [00:20:11], requiring specific IP entry [00:20:21], or experiencing frequent restarts and daily updates, particularly with "5M" [02:10:09]. Issues can range from a "gun getting into my skin" [00:17:59] to a player's mouse behaving erratically on screen [00:28:13]. The voice changer feature in-game may also fail to work [00:36:40].

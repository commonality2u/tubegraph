## Live Streams and Servers

Live streaming is a core component of the [[GTA 5 gaming culture]] in India, with content creators frequently broadcasting their roleplaying sessions.

The stream focuses on the [[GTA 5 roleplay Indian server]] experience, with mentions of specific servers like VLT RP and NoPixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Other servers like "Gans city" are also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## Controversies and "Masala"

The in-game economy is a recurring topic of discussion, with players engaging in various financial activities and facing economic challenges.

## General Economic State
The "stock market" in the city experienced a "heavy downfall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">00:05:57</a>. Despite this, some option traders still managed to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">00:09:50</a>. The general sentiment is that "ups and downs keep happening" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">00:06:56</a>. Skill is considered 20% of success in the market, with luck playing a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">00:07:10</a>.

## Player Wealth and Financial Needs
It is noted that money is not essential to play in the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">00:23:18</a>. One player mentions having 41,000 in currency since the start of the server after scamming a policeman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">00:22:59</a>. Despite this, some individuals face financial difficulties, with one player lamenting not having money for a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">01:10:33</a>.

## Trades and Transactions
Players engage in various trades, including:
*   **Buying/Selling Goods**: A task involves going to Pacific Bank and sending 100,000 currency units to receive "lots of stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">00:42:07</a>. The price for this transaction was set at 20 currency units for one lakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">00:40:59</a>.
*   **Debt and Loans**: Players sometimes lend money to each other, with one character lending 20,000 and expecting it back in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">00:44:31</a>.
*   **Services for Money**: Characters offer to work for money and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">01:09:45</a>.

## Financial Challenges and Exploits
[!WARNING] **Server Stability and Cost**
Discussions about server stability and potential D-DoS attacks touch upon the cost of maintaining a secure server. It is estimated that securing the server could cost around 30,000 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">02:59:52</a>, with recurring payments required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:43">03:00:43</a>. This is considered a "heavy money" investment that perhaps only "NP" can afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:16">02:59:16</a>. It is suggested that if there is a "5-year plan" and a large audience, such an investment could be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">00:48:48</a>.

## Business and Opportunities
*   A new "business" is opening in Gokuldham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">00:28:47</a>, indicating expanding [[ingame_activities_and_challenges | ingame activities]].
*   There's also talk of "illegal activity" and a friend being "stuck in customs," suggesting a black market or smuggling aspect to the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">01:05:54</a>.
*   A "good plan" for causing destruction within the city involves "eating and drinking" to be prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:08">03:00:08</a>.
*   One character, Martin, identifies his motivation as "money, money and only money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:36">02:39:36</a>. He is open to doubling an offer if it's about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:41">02:39:41</a>.

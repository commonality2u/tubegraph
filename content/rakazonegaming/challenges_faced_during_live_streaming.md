Live streaming sessions can be plagued by a variety of technical and operational [[technical_challenges_in_live_streaming | challenges]], often impacting the viewer's experience and requiring immediate troubleshooting during the broadcast. Issues range from equipment malfunctions to internet connectivity problems and synchronization errors.

## Technical Difficulties with Equipment

During live streams, equipment often presents [[challenges_and_technical_difficulties_in_live_streaming | technical difficulties]]. For instance, the projector used for display can be a source of trouble, giving the hosts "trouble" and not appearing "correct" [00:04:06]. Adjusting the projector might require standing on a chair due to its high placement [00:04:25].

Lighting is another recurring issue. There can be problems with individual lights being too dim or too bright [00:00:46], [00:00:53], [00:02:28], requiring frequent adjustments or turning off lights [00:03:09], [00:03:24]. Sometimes, the lights might unexpectedly turn off and on [00:05:01], or even go into standby mode [01:34:50], causing interruptions.

Audio issues also arise, such as the projector's sound interfering with the host's voice [00:13:07], making it hard to increase the speaker's volume [00:13:10]. Unexpected voices or "firla burst" sounds can also cut into the stream [00:22:03]. Microphones might need to be constantly adjusted for optimal sound [03:30:30].

Other equipment problems include:
*   A malfunctioning fridge [00:12:16].
*   A laptop running on low battery [02:59:38].
*   The projector unexpectedly turning off [01:35:29], [01:37:42], and needing to be restarted [01:36:49].
*   Loss of signal to the projector [01:38:00].
*   Fire Stick resolution issues [01:38:44].
*   Projector overheating, leading to automatic shutdown [01:46:45], [02:18:45], [03:10:41].

## Stream Delay and Synchronization Issues

A significant and frequently discussed [[online_live_streaming_challenges | challenge]] is the delay in the live stream. Viewers often comment that the stream is "behind" [00:20:03], with some estimating the delay to be about "one and half balls" [00:21:02] or even "10 seconds per second" [00:21:39]. Despite attempts to refresh the stream, the delay persists [00:20:09], leading to frustration among both hosts and viewers [02:00:03].

This delay can cause spoilers from chat comments [03:13:16], as viewers on other platforms might be watching a more "perfect" and less delayed feed, such as Hotstar (though Hotstar itself is noted to have a 5-second delay) [02:46:01], [02:55:03]. Strategies to fix the delay, such as using different websites, external streaming devices like Fire Stick, or even VPNs for better access to platforms like Prime, are discussed but often prove ineffective [02:27:31], [02:59:51], [03:15:59].

Additionally, there are synchronization issues where the video and audio might not align [01:38:06], or a "screen tearing" effect might occur [02:54:40]. Attempts to screen cast directly to the projector also faced problems, with Hotstar refusing to support the feature [03:08:40].

## Connectivity and Technical Glitches

Internet connectivity is crucial for a smooth live stream. Mentions of WiFi not working [01:39:42] or needing to connect to a different network [01:42:02] highlight this challenge. Issues with "technical difficulty" and things "not working properly" are noted early in the stream [00:02:58], [00:03:01].

Other technical glitches include:
*   The remote not working [01:34:38], [01:37:58].
*   Login issues requiring OTP verification, which can be difficult without strong WiFi signal [01:40:26], [01:40:51].
*   "Lag" and "heavy lag" occurring during the stream [02:55:42], [02:55:45].
*   The scoreboard not updating [03:45:46].

These ongoing [[technical_difficulties_during_streaming | technical difficulties during streaming]] create a challenging environment for the streamers and their audience. The need for constant adjustments and troubleshooting becomes a significant part of the live broadcast, turning even routine tasks into a "mess" [01:59:31].

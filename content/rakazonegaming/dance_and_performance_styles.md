The transcript mentions "dance" directly in the context of an individual feeling exhausted and delegating the practice of "dance etc." to another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The idea of a "playlist character" is also mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, which could imply roles within a performance context, possibly related to [[gaming_and_live_streaming_culture | gaming and live streaming]].

A "butterfly" is referenced multiple times, once in the context of increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> and later described as a "song that butterfly which went elbow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, suggesting a lyrical or expressive element that might be part of a performance or a specific move.

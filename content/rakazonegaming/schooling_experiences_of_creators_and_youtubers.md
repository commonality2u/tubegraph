The [[youtube_series_featuring_creators | YouTube series featuring creators]], "School Chale Hum," aims to explore the schooling experiences of popular creators and YouTubers, delving into their academic journeys and how much they studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The inaugural episode features two guests from "Team Variety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Educational Background and Anecdotes

One of the guests, who attended an English medium school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, described studying at institutions like Mount Carmel School and Anand Niketan, which are considered among the best schools in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A notable [[streamers_personal_anecdotes_and_experiences | personal anecdote]] from their school days includes studying English with a Sanskrit teacher due to strictness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Academic Challenges

Despite parental wishes for them to pursue science until 10th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, they were unable to secure a science stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This was partly due to scoring 75% in 10th grade, which necessitated a change of school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The guest humorously noted a low score of five marks in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, leading them to pursue commerce in 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Further [[challenges_in_the_youtube_streaming_community | academic challenges]] arose as they only achieved 49.9% in 12th grade commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, making college admission difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. They eventually gained admission to Bhartiya Vidyapeeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> and even secured a job through the sports category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

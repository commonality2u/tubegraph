Criminal activities encompass a range of unlawful acts, from large-scale financial deceptions to violent offenses like robbery, kidnapping, and shootings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. These actions often lead to severe consequences for both the perpetrators and the victims, involving the [[police_involvement_and_legal_proceedings | police and legal system]].

## Types of Criminal Activities

Various forms of [[crime_and_corruption | crime]] are described:
*   **Company Scams and Looting** A company was identified as a "scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, leading to the looting of "lakhs of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Robbery** Individuals commit robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, including the looting of a "big Amma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
*   **Kidnapping** The act of [[investigation_and_kidnapping | kidnapping]] innocent people is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. A specific individual, Ajay, was reportedly kidnapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Some individuals were also kidnapped for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, which the police failed to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Shooting** Criminals are involved in shooting innocent people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, and it's noted that criminals are sometimes shot in the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Harassment** Harassment of an opposition MLA's brother was recorded on video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Motivations for Crime

Some individuals turn to crime due to financial distress. After their company closed, people had to "use a criminal five" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:14]</a>, and accumulated significant loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Threats from those they owed money to forced them to commit robbery as there was "no other way left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. Anger can also be a catalyst, with one individual's life changing due to the "fire of anger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Greed for money also motivated betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

## Consequences for Criminals

Engaging in criminal activities leads to severe ramifications:
*   **Becoming a Wanted Criminal** Individuals become "wanted criminals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, constantly sought by the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   **Facing Legal Action** Criminals are expected to receive "a long sentence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. There is a sense that the police will make them "suffer the consequences for the wrong done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Life of Persecution** One criminal states they will "make the life of both of them hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, indicating a life of constant threat and fear.
*   **Inability to Evade Justice** Despite feeling they couldn't be caught, the saying "the clouds of destruction do not stay in the sky for long" holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, implying that justice eventually prevails.

## Role of [[police_involvement_and_legal_proceedings | Police and Justice]]

The [[policing_and_justice_in_the_context_of_crime | police and justice system]] play a central role in responding to [[crime_and_corruption | crime]]:
*   **Investigation and Apprehension** The police are actively involved in searching for criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   **Challenges and Failures** There are instances where the police "failed" to solve kidnapping cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, leading to anger directed at them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:19]</a>. The police face "various challenges and dick loops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> in handling cases. The [[police_and_legal_system_challenges | police department]] was even described as an entity one individual had "started a war" with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Public Perception and Trust** The public can vent anger on the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:20]</a>, and there is a call to question if officers "are not doing a little" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a> in their department.
*   **Waiver of Charges** In some cases, the police reportedly waived robbery charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

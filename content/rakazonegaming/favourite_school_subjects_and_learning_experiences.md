The third episode of "School Let's Go" featured guests Ankita Chauhan and Shriman Bhai, who discussed their educational backgrounds and [[school_experiences_and_memories | school memories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Academic Backgrounds

Ankita Chauhan has completed her graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> and pursued a degree in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Shriman Bhai, while considered an "official graduate," mentioned that he did not complete his second year of graduation and therefore does not have a certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. He attributed this to being captivated by "Katie" (KT/ATKT, likely referring to an academic term for 'Allowed to Keep Terms' or 'Attempts to Keep Terms' which allows students to progress despite failing some subjects) during his graduation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Shriman Bhai initially had extensive plans for his studies, including wanting to be a "morning person" during his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. However, he realized in college that he couldn't adhere to his own plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. After his degree, he took on an internship in content writing during his final months of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This role led him to digital marketing and eventually to YouTube, a career path he genuinely enjoys and was naturally good at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Favourite School Subjects

When asked about their [[school_subject_choices_and_their_impacts | favourite school subjects]]:
*   Ankita Chauhan's favourite subject was English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   Shriman Bhai liked Economics and Chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. He particularly enjoyed Chemistry because his teacher taught it "in a very beautiful way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This highlights the impact of a good teacher on a student's learning experience.

Shriman Bhai also noted that he enjoyed his [[school_experiences_and_memories | school days]] significantly due to his strong involvement in sports, which allowed him to be active throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

## Funny School Anecdotes

Both guests shared [[funny_anecdotes_from_school_life | funny anecdotes from their school days]]:

### Ankita's McDonald's Adventure
Ankita recalled an incident during a science exhibition at another school. Despite teachers' instructions to return to school for food, she and her school boyfriend ran away to McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Her father had called earlier, suggesting she eat at McDonald's since there was no food at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. They daringly crossed a road, found a rickshaw, and "said bye to the teacher in front of his face and left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. After eating, they returned to an empty school and went home. The next day, her vice principal called her father to inform him of the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Shriman Bhai's Window Escape
Shriman Bhai recounted how he and his friends, sitting by a window, discovered a damaged railing in their classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. One friend, possessing significant strength, had gradually damaged it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. After realizing the school wasn't checking the integrity of the railing after students left, they started using it to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Shriman Bhai claimed to be the first successful escapee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This series of escapes increased until they were caught, leading to "big action" against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

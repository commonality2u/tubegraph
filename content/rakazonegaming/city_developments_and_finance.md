The city has seen significant [[server_and_ingame_developments | developments]], including the construction of the city's largest statue, an accomplishment that cost one hundred million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The city is perceived as offering significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, with the potential for easy money-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Financial Ventures and Allegations
Initially, the narrator experienced financial struggles, noting a disparity between their grand dreams and small income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This led to the establishment of a finance company after arranging investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, officially opened in the narrator's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

The company's business model involved forming a corporation to manage investments, assuring clients their money would be secure and accessible when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. It promised aggressive returns, stating it would double money by day and quadruple it by night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

However, the company, later identified as "Scars Liquid Investment and Banking Company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, faced accusations of being a "scam and bogus" operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This led to people losing their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## [[Crime and corruption | Criminal Involvement]] and Consequences
The financial dealings attracted attention from [[crime_and_corruption | the crime world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Individuals like Badshah Singh Parmar, described as the CEO of criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, and Rafiq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, were involved in "sensational crimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. There were reports of arrests, including Aditi ji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

The narrator faced threats, including threats to kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, and police checkpoints were mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Complaints to the police regarding these issues were reportedly ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Ultimately, the narrator's company was destroyed within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

The content creator hosted a [[live_streaming|live stream]] that coincided with the festival season, specifically mentioning Dhanteras and extending well wishes to the audience for Dhanteras and Diwali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:45">[03:11:45]</a>. The streamer encouraged viewers to celebrate safely with their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Platform Features and Audience Interaction

During the [[live_streaming|live stream]], a new "Goal feature" for Super Chat was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, which the streamer noted was a way to potentially earn daily wages and had just been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04">[01:29:04]</a>. The streamer expressed excitement about this new feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Challenges with Mobile Live Streaming

A notable discussion point during the [[live_streaming|live stream]] was the removal of the direct [[live_streaming|live stream]] option on mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:13">[03:27:13]</a>. The streamer stated that it is no longer possible to [[live_streaming|live stream]] "reels live" from newer mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:19">[03:27:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:26">[03:27:26]</a>. This update was upsetting to the streamer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:52">[03:27:52]</a>.

The streamer also indicated that due to the ongoing festival season, the date for the next [[live_streaming|stream]] was uncertain, advising followers to check for updates or follow on Ran Gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:34">[03:11:34]</a>.

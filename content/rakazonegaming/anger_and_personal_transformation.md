The protagonist's life underwent a sudden change due to the "fire of anger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This intense emotion was the only thing on their mind while in New Delhi, in the office and court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Triggers and Consequences of Anger

The anger appears to stem from a situation where a company, involving "lakhs of people," was looted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The protagonist declared the entire company a "scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

This anger led to a profound [[impact_of_anger_on_life | impact on their life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The protagonist felt that due to being from a "banker family," they would be taken to "the lesson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The anger also manifested as threats, stating an intent to "make the life of both of them hell" if anything was remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Transformation into Criminality

The [[company_collapse and desire for revenge | company's closure]] and resulting financial distress led to a significant transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. The protagonist and friends started their own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>, but faced kidnappings for three months, which the police failed to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Loans taken from many people initially provided relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, and robbery charges were waived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

However, due to people threatening to kill them if the money wasn't returned, they felt compelled to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The increasing pressure led them to commit a robbery, as there was "no other way left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. This act marked their transformation, leading them to become "famous in the city as a criminal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, with the police actively searching for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Ongoing Anger and Revenge

The protagonist expressed significant anger towards the police for their past actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, particularly for the police failing to resolve their kidnapping case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. They believe the police will "suffer the consequences for the wrong done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

The experience also involved betrayal, as someone considered an elder sister betrayed them "because of the greed for a few rupees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Despite the transformation and challenges, the protagonist seemed confident in their ability to evade capture, believing the police "could not catch me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. However, it is noted that "the clouds of destruction do not stay in the sky for long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

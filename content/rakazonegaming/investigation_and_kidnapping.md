## Initial Kidnapping
A narrator, who had previously gained "name, success and fame" from a casino, states that they were kidnapped and forced to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They believe their captors "didn't know what trouble they were inviting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. At some point, the narrator claims to have been killed but stated they would be in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Navmi's Investigation
An individual named Navmi initiated an [[private_detective_role_in_gta_5_rp|investigation]] into the events, even as "blood-thirsty people had already started their work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Casino Hostage Situation
During a separate event, everyone inside the casino became [[hostage_situation_and_police_confrontation|hostages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Many of these hostages were friends of the narrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Police Response and Demands
The [[police_involvement_and_legal_proceedings|police department]] quickly surrounded the entire casino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, telling the perpetrators they could not escape and should surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
The perpetrators made a demand of $5 million, stating that if there was any delay, an "Australian person will be injured" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. They threatened to blow up the entire casino if police attempted to break in, claiming to have deployed "C-fors at the entrances" and having "three cargo buffers" for escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. They also warned that all hostages would be shot if their demands were not met promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

The perpetrators also stated that they would leave the hostages "all alive" if they cooperated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. They were aware of the police presence, noting that "the more police time is wasted, the better it will be for us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Underlying Motivation
The casino was not just a gambling place but also a "pan vault" for the government, holding "black money of many ministers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The perpetrators intended to steal this black money, which they knew the government would protect fiercely, even deploying "the entire force of this city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The perpetrators considered themselves "terrorists" on news channels due to the [[heist_planning_and_execution|casino high news]] spreading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Hostage Management
Inside the casino, hostesses were being moved around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The perpetrators anticipated that "someone will definitely try to show smartness" among the hostesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

### Resolution
The demanded money, $5 million, was eventually transferred to the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. The perpetrators then executed their escape plan, including using a helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. They managed to "disappear in the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>, successfully defrauding the authorities of $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

In recent weeks, a new spiritual leader known as Bageshwar Baba, or Dhirendra Shastri, has gained significant attention in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He claims to miraculously understand the problems of his believers and provide equally miraculous solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This phenomenon, often amplified by a Hindu-Muslim angle in the media, has contributed to his rapid popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Satirist Rofl Gandhi has pointed out that the fraud employed by Bageshwar Baba is similar to that used by Christian and Muslim con artists, questioning why Hindus cannot be conned peacefully without objection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. People of all religions are united by superstitions and the desire to believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Bageshwar Baba (Dhirendra Shastri)

Dhirendra Shastri, a 26-year-old from a village in Madhya Pradesh, runs an ashram called Bageshwar Dham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. His real name is Dhirendra Krishna Garg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

He first gained notoriety for his communal speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. In April 2022, he called for Hindus to unite and have bulldozers run over the homes of "stone-pelters," a clear [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | political reference]] to actions taken in Uttar Pradesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. He also urged people to take up arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Despite these speeches, which were aimed at disrupting public peace, no arrests were made, highlighting [[security_issues_in_india | law and order concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Dhirendra later self-identified as a "Dhaba" and stated he would continue making hateful speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Dhirendra has also been accused of practicing untouchability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. In one instance, he reportedly told a person, "Stop! Don't touch me, you untouchable person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## The Challenge by Shyam Manav

During Dhirendra Shastri's Ram Katha in Nagpur, he continued his practice of "reading people's minds" and offering miraculous solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This attracted the attention of Shyam Manav, the National Convenor of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

MANS was founded in the 1980s by Narendra Dabholkar to fight against superstitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Tragically, Dabholkar was murdered in August 2013 by fanatics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Four months later, Maharashtra passed a law against human sacrifices, superstitions, and black magic, a significant victory for the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Shyam Manav, a self-proclaimed Sanatani Hindu who opposes fraud in the name of religion, continued Dabholkar's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. He claims to have busted over 200 fraudulent Babas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Notable Past Cases of MANS

*   **Shakuntala Devi**: Known as the Human Computer, she began practicing [[critique_of_astrology_as_a_fraud_industry | astrology]] and future predictions. Shyam Manav's actions led to a police complaint, and she eventually stopped such practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Foreign Missionaries**: Shyam Manav used the 1986 Drugs and Remedies Act to fight missionaries who claimed to perform miraculous cures, leading to the arrest of four foreign missionaries in India for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### The Challenge to Bageshwar Baba

Shyam Manav challenged Dhirendra Shastri to prove his miraculous abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>:
1.  Identify 10 people in a room by their names, father's names, ages, and phone numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
2.  Predict 10 items kept in an adjacent room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

Manav offered a reward of â‚¹3 million for 90% accuracy and vowed to disband his organization and bow to the Baba if he won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

However, Dhirendra left Nagpur on January 11th, earlier than the advertised end date of his event (January 13th), which Shyam Manav interpreted as him fleeing the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Nagpur police later gave the Baba a clean chit, stating they found no evidence against the Black Magic Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Following this, Shyam Manav received death threats, with some threatening him with the same fate as Narendra Dabholkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. He has since been provided security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Dhirendra's cousin claimed they also received death threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Dhirendra stated that his Ram Katha was scheduled only until January 11th and invited Shyam Manav to challenge him in Raipur or Bageshwar Dham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Shyam Manav countered that the challenge needed to be in Nagpur due to concerns about fraud and the presence of the Home Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Broader Critique of Fraudulent Leaders

### Calls for Accountability

Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand challenged those claiming miracles to use their powers for societal benefit, such as preventing land sinking in Joshimath, stopping forced religious conversions, suicides, disputes, and domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Suggestions for Dhirendra Shastri include joining RAW to uncover secret information, helping police catch criminals, or curing cancer, a claim he has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### The James Randi Foundation

The world-renowned magician James Randi, who used his tricks for entertainment rather than deceit, founded the James Randi Foundation to promote scientific temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. He established a $1 million paranormal challenge, offering the sum to anyone who could provide proof of supernatural or paranormal entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. No one has ever won this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Consequences and Examples of Fraud

While some superstitions may seem harmless, many fraudulent spiritual leaders have been implicated in heinous crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. In 2017, the Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad, a top Hindu body, issued a list of 14 "fake Babas," including popular names like Aasharam, Radhe Ma, Nirmal Baba, and Gurmeet Singh, warning people to beware of such conmen who tarnish the image of sadhus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Other implicated individuals include Nityanand, Mirchi Baba, and Jalebi Baba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

This problem is not limited to one religion:
*   **Muslim Fake Babas**: Akmal Raza reportedly told a woman to hand over her daughter to cure her husband's medical condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Deen Mohammad, a black magic practitioner, was also caught in similar activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Christian Fake Babas**: In Kerala, a woman was blackmailed using her secret confession to a priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Bajinder Singh, with over 2 million YouTube subscribers, claims to guess names, dispel evil spirits, and cure disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **English-speaking Babas**: Some educated individuals are susceptible to "Babas" who speak English, deeming them more credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Examples include those who claim food rots during an eclipse, angry gazes spoil water, or hair and nails continue growing for 11 days after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Such figures are even invited to deliver lectures at IITs, demonstrating a lack of scientific temperament in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

### Why People Fall for Conmen

Several factors contribute to people falling victim to these fraudsters:
*   **Illiteracy**: While a contributing factor, it's not the sole reason, as many educated individuals are also conned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Indian Education System Flaws**: The system often fails to foster critical thinking, instead encouraging rote learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This results in individuals who might have studied basic chemistry still believing that burning wood in worship purifies the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Blind Faith**: People often choose to believe without questioning or doubting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Emotional Exploitation**: Conmen exploit the frustrated and emotionally vulnerable states of individuals who see no solutions to their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Mental Health Support**: Unlike developed countries where people seek therapists for mental problems, India lacks a widespread culture of seeking psychological help, leaving many to turn to these conmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Distinguishing Entertainment from Fraud

Mentalists like Karan Singh Magic and Suhani Shah perform similar "mind-reading" feats but do so for entertainment and do not claim to offer cures for problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Their techniques are impressive but merely tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## The True Spirit of Spiritual Leaders

The original concept of a "Baba" is inherently positive, referring to individuals who study scriptures, possess spiritual understanding, and act as selfless life coaches or counsellors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Historical figures like Adi Shankaracharya, Baba Farid, Kabir, Guru Nanak, Swami Vivekanand, and Jiddu Krishnamurti exemplify this ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. However, the current trend sees jobless individuals pretending to be Babas, using deception to run businesses rather than offering genuine spiritual guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Exposing these conmen is crucial to protect society and benefit both religion and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

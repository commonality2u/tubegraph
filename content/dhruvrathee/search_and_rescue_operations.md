The [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370|search for survivors]] of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, which crashed in the Andes Mountains on October 13, 1972, faced immediate and significant challenges due to the remote, high-altitude terrain and severe weather conditions.

## Initial Search Efforts
Within an hour of the plane's disappearance, the Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service was notified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Four aircraft were deployed to search for survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Despite searching from dusk until night, they found nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. Rescue service officers concluded that the aircraft must have crashed in a remote and inaccessible area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. A major difficulty was that the white plane had crashed in a location covered in white snow and ice, making it very hard to spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

On October 14th, the day after the crash, eleven different aircraft from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay were involved in the search operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Although the chosen search area was correct and included the crash site, they were still unable to locate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

### Survivors' Attempts to Signal
While search aircraft flew overhead, the survivors made desperate attempts to signal for help:
*   They tried writing "SOS" on the plane's roof with lipstick, but realized they didn't have enough to complete the letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   They attempted to create a large cross in the snow using suitcases, hoping it would be visible from above, but this also proved ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   On October 14th, they saw three aircraft fly over them, and screamed and waved, but were unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

## Search Called Off
On October 21st, eight days after the crash, the search and rescue teams officially gave up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. They believed that since no signs of survivors had been found within those eight days, there was little chance anyone could have survived, and continuing the operation was pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. The [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370|search operation]] was formally stopped after 142 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

### Survivors Learn of Cancellation
Eleven days after the crash, survivors found a transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Rugby player Roy Harley, an electronics enthusiast, managed to get it working, though it only allowed for one-way communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. Through this radio, they learned that the search operation had been cancelled, devastating their morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

## Self-Rescue and Re-engagement of Search
Despite the official cancellation, three of the strongest survivors, Fernando Parrado, Roberto Canessa, and Antonio Vizintin, decided to embark on a desperate trek to find help themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. Their initial estimation of their location was drastically wrong; they believed they were only a few kilometers from Chile, but were actually 89 km east in the middle of the Andes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>.

On their journey, they found the aircraft's rear section, which contained a two-way radio system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. They attempted to start it using batteries from the tail section with the help of Roy Harley, but it failed due to incompatible electrical systems (115V AC vs. 24V DC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

After 59 days, and further tragedies including an avalanche, only 16 survivors remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. Parrado and Canessa continued their westward journey, eventually reaching a valley with a flowing river after nine days of trekking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:00">[22:36:00]</a>.

### Contact with the Outside World
On December 20th, 1972, 68 days after the crash, Parrado and Canessa spotted three men on horseback across the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. Due to the loud river, they could not communicate verbally, but one of the men, Chilean farmer Sergio Catalan, noticed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>.

The next day, Catalan returned with paper and pencils, which he attached to a stone and threw across the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>. Parrado wrote a message in Spanish:
> "I come from a plane that fell in the mountains. I am from Uruguay. I have been walking for 10 days. My injured friends are at the crash site. We need help urgently, but I don't know how to get help. We don't have any food. We are weak. And we don't have it in them to walk anymore. Save us. Where are we?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05:00">[24:05:00]</a>

Upon reading the note, Sergio Catalan and his friends realized the incredible truth â€“ these were survivors of the plane crash that had been reported months ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35:00">[24:35:00]</a>. Catalan then rode for 10 hours to the nearest city to inform the army command, who then contacted army headquarters in Santiago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:00">[24:59:00]</a>.

## Final Rescue
The story of the survivors immediately became international news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>. The Chilean Air Force dispatched three helicopters for the [[rescue_efforts_and_the_sinking_aftermath|rescue effort]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>. Army officers interviewed Parrado and Canessa for the crash site location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>. Parrado, who had brought the pilot's flight chart and plotted their hiking path, accompanied the army officers on a helicopter to help locate the remaining survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>.

On December 22nd, 1972, 70 days after the crash, two search and [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370|rescue helicopters]] finally reached the crash site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>. All 16 survivors were rescued, albeit in terrible condition due to altitude sickness, dehydration, broken bones, and malnutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>. All eventually recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>. This event is often referred to as "The Miracle of the Andes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:19:00">[27:19:00]</a>.

On November 12, 1996, at approximately 3:55 PM, a catastrophic mid-air collision occurred near Charkhi Dadri, India, involving a chartered Kazakhstan Airlines aircraft and a Saudi Airlines flight [00:00:00. - 00:00:52]. This incident, India's first and only mid-air collision and its worst air disaster, highlighted critical deficiencies in [[air_traffic_control_and_radar_technology | air traffic control]] and radar technology of the time [00:02:24 - 00:02:30].

## The Rules of the Sky
Similar to roads on the ground, the sky has set paths for airplanes known as Airways, which are further divided into air corridors [00:03:30 - 00:03:45]. The height at which an airplane flies is called its flight level [00:04:01]. According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) standards, a minimum vertical separation of 1,000 feet and a horizontal safety radius of 14 km (approximately 8.7 miles) must be maintained between two aircraft [00:04:06 - 00:04:24].

## Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs)
Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) are responsible for ensuring that all airplanes follow these rules [00:04:28 - 00:04:32]. They monitor aircraft position, speed, and altitude from the ground, viewing them as blinking dots on their screens [00:04:37 - 00:04:56].

## Radar Technology
The information ATCs receive about flights comes from radar systems [00:05:00 - 00:05:04]. Radar is a device that uses radio waves to detect distant objects like airplanes, spacecraft, and even tornadoes [00:05:07 - 00:05:13]. Radars used for aircraft detection are classified into two main types:

*   **Primary Radar**: This system uses antennas placed at strategic locations to emit radio waves [00:05:25 - 00:05:31]. By calculating the time it takes for reflected radio waves to return from an aircraft, primary radars can determine its horizontal distance [00:05:33 - 00:05:43]. However, they cannot determine the aircraft's altitude [00:05:43].
*   **Secondary Radar**: Used to calculate vertical distance, secondary radars involve a transponder on the aircraft [00:05:46 - 00:05:52]. When signals from primary antennas are received by the transponder, it responds with its own signal, providing more reliable information about the flight's position [00:05:55 - 00:06:07].

### Limitations in the 1990s
During the 1990s, when the Charkhi Dadri incident occurred, secondary radar technology was not widely used [00:06:10 - 00:06:17]. ATCs largely relied on data from primary radar, which was less reliable and only provided approximate distances between planes [00:06:21 - 00:06:29]. To determine exact altitudes, ATCs had to constantly communicate with pilots, who would verbally report their altitudes [00:06:32 - 00:06:41]. ATCs then manually jotted down height and speed parameters to chart flight paths [00:06:42 - 00:06:50]. This manual and stressful workload, particularly at busy airports like Delhi, where 20-30 flights landed and took off hourly, contributed to [[air_traffic_control_and_radar_technology | ATC]] being considered one of the most stressful jobs in the world during that period [00:06:52 - 00:07:05, 00:07:13 - 00:07:30].

## The Charkhi Dadri Collision: A Case Study
The Charkhi Dadri collision, which resulted in 349 fatalities, illustrates the "Swiss Cheese Model" of accident causation [00:03:32, 00:07:49 - 00:07:56]. This model suggests that accidents rarely occur due to a single reason, but rather from a series of small mistakes or "holes" aligning at the wrong time [00:08:25 - 00:08:39].

In this particular disaster, several factors aligned:
*   **Misunderstanding of Instructions**: The Kazakh aircraft, instructed by [[air_traffic_control_and_radar_technology | ATC]] VK Dutta to maintain 15,000 feet, descended to 14,000 feet, the same altitude as the Saudi flight [00:01:24 - 00:01:28, 00:09:24 - 00:09:26]. [[investigation_of_airplane_accidents | Flight data recorder]] analysis revealed that the Kazakh pilots either misunderstood the instruction or thought it was for another flight [00:10:08 - 00:10:25].
*   **Language Barrier**: A significant contributing factor was the Kazakh pilots' poor English proficiency, requiring a radio operator on board to translate [[air_traffic_control_and_radar_technology | ATC]] messages from English to Russian [00:09:55 - 00:10:08]. This led to an "error of understanding" [00:10:10 - 00:10:13].
*   **Single Air Corridor**: At the time, Delhi Airport had only one air corridor for both departing and incoming flights, increasing the risk of collisions [00:11:15 - 00:11:24].
*   **Reliance on Primary Radar**: The absence of secondary radar meant ATCs relied solely on less reliable primary radar data, necessitating constant communication with pilots for altitude information, a system vulnerable to miscommunication [00:11:27 - 00:11:31].

## Post-Accident [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | Aviation Safety Improvements]]
The Charkhi Dadri accident led to significant [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | aviation safety improvements]] globally, aimed at preventing similar incidents [00:11:34 - 00:11:42].
*   **Separated Air Corridors**: Airports now have separate air corridors for incoming and departing planes [00:11:54 - 00:11:58].
*   **Mandatory [[introduction_of_traffic_collision_avoidance_system_tcas | Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)]]**: Despite initial government reluctance and the expense of the technology, the accident prompted India to mandate the installation of [[introduction_of_traffic_collision_avoidance_system_tcas | TCAS]] on all 30+ seater aircraft after December 31, 1998 [00:12:00 - 00:12:27, 00:13:15 - 00:13:24].
    *   [[introduction_of_traffic_collision_avoidance_system_tcas | TCAS]] is a system that alarms pilots if another aircraft gets within 1,000 feet vertically [00:12:47 - 00:12:56]. More critically, it advises pilots on which direction to fly (upwards or downwards) to maintain safe separation [00:12:57 - 00:13:11]. India's initiative eventually influenced other countries to implement [[introduction_of_traffic_collision_avoidance_system_tcas | TCAS]] [00:13:24 - 00:13:28].
*   **English Proficiency for Pilots**: To address [[communication_challenges_in_international_aviation | communication challenges in international aviation]], India raised the issue with the ICAO in 1998 [00:13:30 - 00:14:08]. Following extensive debate, English was officially chosen as the mandatory international language for pilots [00:14:17 - 00:14:32, 00:14:54 - 00:14:57]. This ensures a minimum level of English proficiency for all pilots flying internationally [00:14:10 - 00:14:16, 00:14:33 - 00:14:40]. Domestic flights, however, may still use national languages for communication [00:14:57 - 00:15:04].

These comprehensive changes, essentially "filling the holes" in the Swiss Cheese Model, have successfully prevented further mid-air collisions since the Charkhi Dadri disaster [00:15:06 - 00:15:26].

Initially, in July 1940, Europe saw three major countries remaining: Germany, the Soviet Union, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. There was a peace agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, meaning Hitler did not need to worry about the Soviet Union attacking Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## German Invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa)

After failing to invade Britain, Hitler shifted his focus from the UK to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Hitler's intention was to defeat the Soviet Union to scare Britain into signing a peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The primary reasons for Hitler's invasion, despite the existing peace treaty, were his contempt for communists and his belief that capturing a country as large as the Soviet Union was necessary for Germany to become the world's number one superpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Hitler was suffering from megalomania, believing he could rule the entire world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Attacking the Soviet Union was a major mistake for Hitler and became a turning point in [[World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Hitler planned to invade the Soviet Union by dividing German forces into three parts: one towards Leningrad, another to attack Moscow, and a third from the South through Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This operation began on June 22, 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Despite the Soviet Union's army being much larger with 20,000 tanks compared to Germany's 6,000, German technology was superior, giving Hitler the upper hand initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. To protect itself, the Soviet Union joined hands with Britain and became a part of the Allied Powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. They formed a plan to send supplies to the Soviet Union army via Iran, which led to the UK and the Soviet Union invading Iran together due to the Iranian government favoring Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Within weeks, German forces advanced rapidly, reaching within 300 km of Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. However, disagreements among Hitler and his military commanders delayed the next German advance until October, allowing the cold season to set in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The cold gave the advantage to the Soviets, who were accustomed to fighting in such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. A second advantage for the Soviets came from their non-aggression treaty with Japan, which allowed Soviet Army troops stationed at the Eastern border to return and fight Germany in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Battle of Stalingrad

By mid-1942, Hitler decided to focus on the Southern Soviet Union to disrupt their supply chain from Iran, leading to a devastating battle in Stalingrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The Soviet Union army successfully defended itself against the German army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

The Battle of Stalingrad continued until November 1942, when winter again made fighting difficult for the German army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Despite the German army almost gaining total control, the Soviets continued fighting until the very end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The Battle of Stalingrad was the deadliest battle during [[World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Finally, Soviet soldiers succeeded, surrounding nearly 300,000 German troops, who surrendered in February 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This was the biggest turning point in [[World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Soviet Counterattack and End of War

After the D-Day landings in June 1944, Hitler was in a dangerous situation, facing losses in the Soviet Union due to the cold and now an attack from the Western front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Hitler decided to withdraw his army from the Eastern front to focus on the Allied forces moving in from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

As soon as Hitler withdrew his army, the Soviets launched a major counterattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Within two months, the Soviets regained about 600 km of territory from Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania came under the occupation of the Soviet Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Germany was being attacked from three sides, including the Eastern front by the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

Finally, in May 1945, Berlin was surrounded by the Soviet Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Hitler killed himself on April 30, 1945, and Germany formally surrendered on May 8, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Post-WWII Impact

Following Germany's surrender, its territories were divided, leading to the formation of East Germany and West Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Poland was recreated from a large part of East Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. The borders of many countries were redrawn, shaping the current map of Europe due to [[World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

The permanent members of the United Nations, established in October 1945 to prevent future World Wars, were largely the countries that constituted the Allied Forces in [[World War II]], which included the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The frameworks for the World Bank, IMF, and NATO were also set up after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

Everyone has aspirations, whether it's completing college assignments, preparing for exams, or seeking a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite knowing what needs to be achieved, individuals often struggle to act on their intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. There's an innate feeling that tasks can be put off until tomorrow, making it seem acceptable to relax or engage in distractions like social media or videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This phenomenon, known as procrastination, results in wasted time and a delay in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This article explores the psychology behind procrastination from a scientific perspective, seeking real solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Motivation, often short-lived, is not the focus here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Instead, the aim is to delve into the scientific root causes of procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Historical and Modern Trends of Procrastination

Dr. Piers Steel, a leading researcher in the [[Theories Explaining Motivation and Procrastination | science of motivation]] and procrastination, has studied this field for over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. He argues that procrastination is not a modern problem but has existed for ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Egyptian hieroglyphs from 1400 BC mention it, with one translation stating, "Friend, stop putting off work and allow us to go home in good time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. An ancient Greek poet also spoke on the matter around 800 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. In India, Sant Kabir famously advised, "Work today instead of putting it off for tomorrow, Work now, instead of putting it off for later, If a catastrophe strikes now, when will you prepare for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Despite these historical warnings, modern society has seen a significant increase in procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. According to Dr. Steel, chronic procrastination has grown by 300% to 400% in the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Today, approximately half of the global population frequently procrastinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## The Nature and Consequences of Procrastination

People tend to procrastinate on tasks that are important and require significant physical, mental, or emotional effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This includes preparing for exams or job interviews, completing office projects, exercising, or addressing emotional matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. These tasks are often replaced with easier, more interesting activities like browsing social media or watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Deadlines play a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. People often procrastinate until a deadline looms, turning short breaks into hours of wasted time due to the addictive design of platforms like social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Studies, such as those by Ellis and Knaus (1977) and O'Brien (2002), indicate that 80% to 90% of college students procrastinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

When there are no deadlines, procrastination can continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. While academic procrastination might lead to lower grades, life-long procrastination can result in profound regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For instance, putting off a dream career or neglecting [[Scientific methods for weight loss | fitness]] can lead to severe health issues like diabetes or heart conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Procrastinating on emotional matters, such as spending time with loved ones, can lead to deep regret and disappointment when opportunities are lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Beyond regret, procrastination contributes to stress, anxiety, depression, and fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The discrepancy between desired actions and actual behavior creates mental conflict, known as Cognitive Dissonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Studies show a direct link between procrastination and higher levels of these negative psychological states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Guilt is another common feeling associated with procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## [[Theories Explaining Motivation and Procrastination | Scientific Theories Explaining Procrastination]]

Scientists have proposed several theories to explain why people procrastinate, despite its negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Expectancy Theory
Proposed by Victor Harold Vroom in 1964, this theory states that a person's motivation for a task depends on their expectation of achieving a successful outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. If the perceived chances of success are low, motivation will also be low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. For example, a student confident in their ability to achieve a high rank will be highly motivated to study, while one who believes their chances are low will have less motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Need Theory
Coined by psychologist David McClelland in the 1960s, this theory identifies three types of fundamental human needs: power, achievement, and affiliation (the need for social relationships) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Motivation is higher when a task aligns with an individual's dominant psychological need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. For instance, politicians driven by a strong need for power will be highly motivated by tasks related to gaining influence, but may procrastinate on tasks related to public service if that is not their dominant need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Understanding one's dominant need can help align tasks with personal motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Cumulative Prospect Theory
Developed by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1992, this theory highlights two key aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>:
1.  **Loss Aversion**: The pain of a loss is generally felt more strongly than the pleasure of an equivalent gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. For example, motivation to exercise is much higher when told it's to prevent a serious health condition (loss avoidance) than when it's for general fitness (gain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Similarly, avoiding being fired is a stronger motivator than aiming for a promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
2.  **Relativity of Gains and Losses**: The perception of gains and losses is relative to an individual's reference point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. For someone from a disadvantaged background, securing a job might be a life-altering gain and a huge motivator, whereas for someone already affluent, the same job might not provide as much motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### Hyperbolic Discounting Theory
This theory suggests that immediate rewards are preferred and motivate action more strongly than rewards that will be received in the distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. People tend to prioritize instant gratification over long-term benefits, even if the long-term benefit is greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## Temporal Motivation Theory

In 2006, Dr. Piers Steel and Dr. Cornelius J. KÃ¶nig combined these four theories into a meta-theory called the Temporal Motivation Theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This integrated theory posits that motivation to do a task arises when several factors align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>:
*   **Personal Need Alignment**: The task and its reward match one's personal psychological needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **High Expectancy**: The individual believes they can actually complete the task and achieve the reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   **Value of Reward**: The reward for completing the task is perceived as significant and desirable (higher than one's reference line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Immediacy of Reward**: The reward can be obtained relatively soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

When these factors are combined, procrastination is less likely to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Criticisms and Additional Factors

While the Temporal Motivation Theory provides a comprehensive framework, some scientists, like psychologists Tim Pychyl and J. R. Ferrari, argue that it doesn't cover everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. They question why people experience guilt when doing something they are more motivated to do (like watching YouTube instead of studying), if motivation is purely rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

In 2012, Pychyl and Ferrari proposed an additional factor contributing to [[Psychology of Procrastination | procrastination]]: the **Fear of Failure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Some individuals procrastinate because they are scared of failing a task, leading them to avoid it and engage in other activities instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## [[Strategies to Overcome Procrastination | Strategies to Overcome Procrastination]]

Understanding these underlying causes is key to identifying and addressing one's own procrastination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

1.  **Self-Reflection**: Begin by asking why you are procrastinating and write down the causes. Identifying the problem is half the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
2.  **Apply Theoretical Insights**:
    *   **Loss Aversion**: If lacking motivation due to a task seeming insignificant, remind yourself of the negative consequences of *not* doing it, such as losing a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
    *   **Expectancy**: If confidence in achieving a high rank is low, shift focus to areas where you are more confident or passionate, where good results are more attainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
    *   **Hyperbolic Discounting**: For long-term goals or distant rewards, break the process into smaller steps and give yourself small rewards after each completed step to provide instant gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
3.  **Address Fear of Failure**:
    *   Remember that "not trying is worse than failing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Fear of failure often stems from ego and concern about what others might say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
    *   Recognize that living a life based on others' expectations will lead to regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
    *   The **Temporal Theory of Regret** (Gilovich and Medvec, 1995) states that while actions might produce short-term regret, inaction generates more regret in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Failing after trying is less regrettable than never trying at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
4.  **Minimize Distractions**: Once the deeper reasons for procrastination are addressed, distractions like social media become less impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. However, if they remain an issue, scientific approaches to dealing with social media addiction can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

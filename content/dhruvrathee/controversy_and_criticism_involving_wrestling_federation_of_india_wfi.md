The [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | Wrestling Federation of India (WFI)]] has faced significant criticism and controversy, particularly concerning its policies, treatment of athletes, and allegations of sexual misconduct against its former president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. These issues have highlighted systemic failures within the Indian wrestling administration.

## Allegations Against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh

In 2023, serious allegations of sexual misconduct were raised against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who was then the chief of the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. It was alleged that Brij Bhushan would seek rooms on the same floor as female athletes during international competitions, mentally torture them, and try to call them to his room for one-on-one meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

Prominent Indian wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, and Sakshi Malik, led a protest to demand the lodging of an FIR against Brij Bhushan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. This protest took place at Delhi's Jantar Mantar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

During these protests:
*   Wrestlers, who had brought pride to the country, were "dragged on the streets by the police" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, chose to remain silent, despite having previously called Vinesh Phogat "family" when she was winning medals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. This silence was attributed to Brij Bhushan being a BJP MP at the time, and later, his son, Karan Bhushan Singh, also became a BJP MP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.
*   A large-scale propaganda campaign was launched against the protesting wrestlers, with a "media trial" initiated against the victims instead of the accused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. Lies were spread, and AI was used to morph their faces to show them laughing while protesting, aiming to defame Vinesh, Sakshi, and Bajrang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This behavior was criticized as a "failure of the entire government system" for allowing such a man to continue in his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

After elections were held, Brij Bhushan's proxy, Sanjay Singh, became the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. In protest, Sakshi Malik announced her retirement from wrestling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.

## WFI's Treatment of Vinesh Phogat

The [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]]'s actions and policies have also been criticized for their detrimental impact on athletes like Vinesh Phogat:

### Lack of Support During Tokyo Olympics
Despite repeated requests, Vinesh Phogat was not provided a dedicated physiotherapist during the Tokyo Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This was crucial for a wrestler like Vinesh, who undergoes difficult weight cutting, strength regaining, and further weight cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Instead, she had to rely on a physiotherapist accompanying the shooting team, who could not provide adequate support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Vinesh stated she had to be her own physiotherapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

### Accusations of Indiscipline
Following her loss in the Tokyo Olympics, the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] accused Vinesh Phogat of indiscipline and temporarily suspended her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. A show-cause notice listed three charges:
1.  Not staying or training with her teammates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
2.  Not wearing her kit sponsor, Shiv Naresh's jersey, during the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

Vinesh formally replied through her lawyer, stating that she followed quarantine rules of the IOC and Japanese government, and staying separately minimized her COVID risk as she had trained in Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Regarding the jersey, she confirmed she wore it regularly but couldn't get it washed before the competition due to being sick and vomiting, acknowledging it as an "unintentional and incorrect planning" mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh deemed her response unsatisfactory but "forgave" her, threatening a lifetime ban for any more mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

### Criticism of Foreign Coaches and NGOs
The [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] has expressed problems with foreign coaches, despite their significant contributions to Indian wrestlers' success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Vinesh's coach, Woller Akos, who contributed immensely to her success since 2018, was accused by the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] of training his wife with Vinesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Vinesh defended Akos, highlighting his dedication, including leaving his one-year-old son in Hungary to train her during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

The [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] also had issues with [[Supportive Role of NGOs in Indian Wrestling | sports NGOs]] like Olympic Gold Quest and JSW, which had brought in these foreign coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. The [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] ordered these NGOs to stop their "interference," claiming they were "spoiling" wrestlers and that the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] could manage its own athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. However, this contradicted the lack of support Vinesh experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. By November 2021, JSW and OGQ were forced to involve the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] in any contracts with wrestlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

## Controversial Policy and Trials

Under Brij Bhushan Singh's leadership, the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] implemented a highly controversial policy change: even after a wrestler secured an Olympic quota, they could still be called for a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. This policy included a strange condition that trials would be held only if the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] deemed it necessary, implying they could also be skipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. This suggests a desire by politicians for "total control over our athletes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

### Paris Olympics Quota Controversy
This policy became a point of contention for the Paris Olympics qualification. The Ad Hoc Committee had assured trials for quota winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. However, on May 21st, they suddenly announced that there would be no trial, calling it a "one-time-only exemption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. This decision was made when Sanjay Singh was the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

This decision directly impacted Vinesh Phogat, who had already secured a quota in the 50 kg category after realizing she couldn't trust the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]] regarding trials in the 53 kg category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. The cancellation of trials for the 53 kg category meant [[Antim Panghal Olympic Quota Controversy | Antim Panghal]], who had secured the quota, would compete without facing trials against other top wrestlers, including Vinesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. Critics questioned if this was done out of "enmity with Vinesh Phogat" to prevent her from competing in the 53 kg category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

## Calls for Transparency

The repeated incidents and controversies underline the need for greater transparency in the [[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI]]'s rules and regulations, and for adequate facilities and support for sportspersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. Despite these challenges, wrestlers like Vinesh Phogat continue to inspire by striving to make Indian wrestling a safe space and achieving international success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

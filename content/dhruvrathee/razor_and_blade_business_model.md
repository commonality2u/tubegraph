The **Razor and Blade Model** is a business tactic where a company sells its primary product cheaply to create consumer dependency, while its main source of profit comes from a side product that is expensive and requires repeated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The term originates from the observation that a razor is a one-time purchase, but its blades must be bought repeatedly, generating ongoing revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

## Applications of the Model

### Printers
Printer companies often sell their printers at a loss with the intention of profiting from the subsequent sale of expensive ink cartridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. They deliberately design printers to be compatible only with their own ink cartridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. To enforce this, companies install microchips in printers and issue regular firmware updates to prevent the use of third-party ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

In 2018, nine printer companies released approximately 900 such updates, averaging three per day, solely to detect and disable printers using non-proprietary ink, or void their warranties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Consumers are often not informed of these restrictions before purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

The cost of manufacturing a liter of ink is estimated to be between $20-$40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. However, ink can be sold for prices as high as $12,000 per gallon (3.7 liters), making it more expensive than human blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Companies justify these high prices by citing research and development costs, though critics argue it is merely a tactic for increased profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Furthermore, printer ink cartridges are subject to [[shrinkflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, with the quantity of ink decreasing over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. What was once sold as a 'Standard' cartridge may now be labeled 'Extra Large' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. HP faced issues in Australia, paying $100,000 in compensation to 2,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. In 2022, HP also settled with European customers, paying $1.35 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Epson was sued in the US in 2019 for disabling printers that used third-party ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### Water Purifiers
Water purifying companies also employ this model by requiring annual servicing and filter changes after the initial purchase of a water purifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Despite the availability of technology for longer-lasting filters, this approach maximizes recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) and Warranties
Companies often use AMCs for home appliances like water purifiers and washing machines, which can benefit the company more than the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. For example, a ₹2,500 AMC for a water purifier might not cover expensive parts like the RO membrane or filters, which cost ₹4,000-₹6,000 and require additional payment for replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Moving a water purifier yourself can even void the AMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Some RO companies limit free replacements under AMC if the unit runs for more than 8 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

In many cases, product warranties may prove ineffective or misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. For example, a washing machine under a 4-year warranty stopped working after 1.5 years. The company first claimed parts were no longer manufactured, then stated the damage wasn't covered, despite the warranty card indicating all parts were included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

## Countering the Model

The introduction of competition can lead to beneficial changes for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. For instance, Urban Company's Native RO water purifier offers a filter that lasts two years, eliminating the need for an immediate AMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This product also features an unconditional warranty covering almost all aspects of usage, regardless of water quality or volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

Ultimately, consumers need to be vigilant against these tactics and raise their voices to pressure companies and governments for stricter regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. This collective action can force companies to adopt more transparent and honest [[marketing strategies and consumer protection laws | marketing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

Nuclear power plants, developed significantly after [[the_development_and_testing_of_nuclear_weapons_during_world_war_ii | World War II]], were a major area of investment for the Soviet Union, including the construction of the [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The purpose of these plants is to generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## Basic Principles of Electricity Generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>
Most methods of generating electricity require a rotating wheel to produce kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. In nuclear energy, this wheel is moved by steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Water is heated by nuclear reactions to create this steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Components of a Nuclear Reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>
The core of a nuclear reactor primarily consists of three main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>:

### 1. Fuel Rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>
Fuel rods contain nuclear fuel that causes the nuclear reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. In the case of the [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl]] reactors, this was Uranium Dioxide enriched with Uranium 235 Isotope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

#### Nuclear Fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>
*   Uranium-235 is an isotope that permits nuclear fission reactions to create nuclear energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   This isotope is unstable and disintegrates on its own, releasing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   It can also be broken apart if a neutron collides with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   In nuclear fission, one atom splits into two, forming extra lonesome neutrons and releasing kinetic energy, which converts to thermal energy to move the turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   The extra neutrons released can collide with more atoms, initiating a Nuclear Chain Reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

### 2. Control Rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>
Control rods are used to slow down the nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.
*   In the [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl]] reactors, these were made of Boron Carbide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   Boron absorbs neutrons, preventing them from colliding with other atoms and slowing down the nuclear fission reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   The more control rods are inserted into the reactor core, the more the reaction slows down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

### 3. Moderator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>
Moderators help to speed up the nuclear reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   In the RBMK 1000 reactors used at [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl]], graphite blocks served as moderators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   Graphite slows down the energy of neutrons, increasing the chances of neutrons colliding with Uranium atoms, thereby increasing the speed of the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   Today, most nuclear plants use water as a moderator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

> [!info] Analogy for Reactor Control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>
> *   The fuel rods where the reaction takes place are like a car moving on a road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
> *   The moderator acts as the gas pedal; the deeper it is, the faster the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
> *   The control rods act as the brakes, slowing down the reaction when engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

## Cooling System <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>
Water acts as a coolant to prevent overheating around the reactor, requiring a constant supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   At [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl]], water came from a nearby man-made reserve and a river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   Water pumps ensured continuous supply, backed up by diesel generators in case of a power cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   A design concept for [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl]] was that turbines could power the pumps for 1-2 minutes during diesel generator startup, using residual steam after reactor shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Technical Flaws and Incidents (Chernobyl RBMK 1000)

### Xenon Poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>
During nuclear fission, Xenon 135 is created as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Like Boron, Xenon 135 can absorb neutrons, effectively "hitting the brakes" on the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.
*   Normally, Xenon burns out or decays within a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
*   However, if power output is too low, Xenon can accumulate in the core, a phenomenon known as Xenon poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. This further slows down the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.
*   When the reaction speeds up significantly, accumulated Xenon burns out, removing its neutron-absorbing effect and leading to a sudden power surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

### Positive Feedback Loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>
*   In the [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl]] RBMK reactor, as water (coolant) turned into steam, it couldn't effectively cool the reactor, causing the reaction to gain more speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. This creates a positive feedback loop where increased heat leads to less coolant, leading to more heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
*   This was exacerbated because graphite was the moderator, which remained even as water decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

### Control Rod Design Flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>
A critical design flaw in the [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl]] reactor's control rods contributed to the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.
*   While the main part of a control rod is made of Boron (to slow reactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, the tip was made of graphite, the same material used as a moderator to speed up the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.
*   When the emergency shutdown button was pressed and the control rods were inserted, their graphite tips initially entered the reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. This caused an immediate, infinite speed-up of the already rapid reaction, leading to a massive blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

## Modern Reactor Design Improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:01]</a>
As a direct result of the [[causes_of_the_chernobyl_disaster | Chernobyl disaster]], the World Association of Nuclear Operators was founded in 1989 to conduct safety checks and research improvements for nuclear power plants worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.
*   Present-day nuclear reactors use water as both the moderator and the coolant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.
*   This design prevents a positive feedback loop; if the amount of water decreases, the moderator also decreases, akin to "taking your foot off the accelerator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. This creates a negative feedback loop, enhancing safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

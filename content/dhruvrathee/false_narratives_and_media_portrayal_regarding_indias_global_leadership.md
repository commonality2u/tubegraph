Since May 2014, there has been a narrative suggesting that the world has suddenly begun to look up to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This narrative is often promoted by government officials and pro-government media, claiming India's renewed global renown and influence under the current administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, a closer examination of historical facts, international perceptions, and global rankings reveals a different picture.

## The "World Listens to India" Claim

Prime Minister Modi and other BJP leaders, such as Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini and BJP leader Rajnath Singh, have repeatedly asserted that "When India speaks, the whole world listens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This statement implies that before 2014, India lacked international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

However, this phrase was originally used by former US President Barack Obama in reference to Dr. Manmohan Singh. Obama stated, "When Manmohan Singh speaks, the whole world listens," praising Singh's deep understanding of economics and acknowledging India's emergence as a superpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Debunking Claims of Renewed Cultural Popularity

### Konark Sun Temple

Home Minister Amit Shah claimed that PM Modi popularized Konark's Sun Temple worldwide through photographs with global leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Yet, UNESCO's official website shows that Konark Temple became a World Heritage Site in 1984, long before the current administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Yoga's International Appeal

Similar claims have been made about Yoga's international recognition, with ministers attributing its global celebration to PM Modi's efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. While the UN did proclaim June 21st as International Yoga Day in December 2014, acknowledging its "Universal Appeal," the global practice of Yoga significantly predates this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Examples of Yoga's pre-2014 popularity include:
*   Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau practicing Mayur Asana in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau also practicing yoga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Baba Ramdev introducing yoga in America in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Yehudi Menuhin, a famous violinist, practicing Sheersh asana in a photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This was a result of his introduction to Yogacharya BKS Iyengar by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in 1952, after which Iyengar popularized yoga globally, starting in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   Swami Vivekananda was the first to introduce yoga spiritually in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Other yoga gurus like Indira Devi, K. Pattabhi Jois, and Richard Hittleman also contributed to popularizing Hatha Yoga internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Indian Spirituality, Music, and Film

Indian spirituality and meditation were popularized by figures like Swami Vivekananda, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Osho, and Paramhansa Yogananda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Notably, The Beatles meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1967 and learning Transcendental Meditation in Rishikesh in 1968 greatly boosted this popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Indian classical music was taken to the world stage by Pandit Ravi Shankar, who started international performances in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He won the first Indian Grammy Award for his album "West Meets East" with Yehudi Menuhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Ustad Bismillah Khan also had his first international performance in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

Bollywood's global appeal is long-standing, with actors like Mithun Chakraborty and Raj Kapoor being popular in Russia and Ukraine for decades, and Shahrukh Khan being a global star today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Renowned filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, and Mira Nair brought international acclaim to India through film festivals before 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Many Indians had also won Oscars, Nobel Prizes, Booker Prizes, and Olympic medals by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Reality of India's Global Standing Post-2014

Despite claims of India's ascent, several indicators point to challenges:
*   **Citizenship Renunciation**: In 2022, over 225,000 people gave up Indian citizenship, breaking all records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Additionally, nearly 97,000 Indians were arrested trying to enter the US illegally in one year (November 2023 data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **[[fake_news_in_indian_media | Media portrayal and misinformation]]**: [[fake_news_in_indian_media | Fake news]] and [[propaganda_and_misinformation_regarding_bjp | pro-government media]] often circulate false images, such as a fabricated New York Times front page calling PM Modi "the last hope of the world," which the NYT had to publicly debunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **International Media Perception**:
    *   While Time Magazine published "Why Modi Matters" in 2015, its 2019 cover titled him "India's Divider in Chief," accusing him of ripping apart India's social fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
    *   Australian newspaper Herald Sun reported on PM Modi's links to a "mass rapist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
    *   Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asia criticized Modi for his speeches against Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
    *   International news outlets like CBS News and The New York Times reported on lynchings in India, such as the Palgarh incident and the death of Tabrez Ansari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The term "lynching" was rarely heard in India before 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **International Rankings**: India's rankings have declined in several key global indices:
    *   Human Development Index: 134th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>
    *   Global Peace Index 2023: 126th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>
    *   Global Hunger Index 2023: 111th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>
    *   Democracy Index 2023: 104th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>
    *   Press Freedom Index 2024: 159th, significantly lower than 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>

## Diplomatic Relations and International Criticism

India's "Look East policy" has reportedly failed, and relations with neighboring countries are at a low point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Controversial statements by BJP leaders Nupur Sharma and Naveen Kumar Jindal led to criticism from Middle East countries and a UN Secretary General instruction on religious tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

The European Parliament passed a resolution on India's human rights situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, and the United Nations Human Rights Office refused to recognize the National Human Rights Commission of India for two consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Singapore's Prime Minister expressed concern over criminal charges against Indian MPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, and the US has voiced concerns about India's democracy and the CAA law, calling it "fundamentally discriminatory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Russia has also sold weapons to Pakistan despite India's opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

There is a prevalent [[selective_outrage_and_media_narratives_in_india | "Double Think"]] phenomenon, where pro-government narratives oscillate between "the whole world is rooting for us" and "the whole world is against us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## Historical Global Leadership: Nehru's Era

India's global leadership and respect were well-established long before 2014.

### Jawaharlal Nehru's International Stature

When Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru visited the US for the first state visit in October 1949, he was received by President Harry Truman at the airport with a 19-gun salute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. He was welcomed not only as a head of government but as a respected leader of a great nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Later, he was also received by Presidents Dwight Eisenhower (1956) and John F. Kennedy (1961) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

During the Cold War, when the world was divided into Western and Eastern blocs, Nehru garnered immense respect globally, despite India being a poor, newly independent nation that was not even self-sufficient in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Japanese author Tomio Mizokami noted Nehru's great influence as "the leader of a good, neutral country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

Martin Luther King Jr. described Nehru as a leader of three extraordinary eras: the anti-colonial struggle, the fight for peace post-WWII, and a "great world power" upholding India's wish for peace amidst global struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. King emphasized that Nehru's reputation, wisdom, and courage made him an "honest mediator" for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

Nelson Mandela considered Nehru his hero, quoting his writings, and even derived his autobiography's title, "Long Walk to Freedom," from Nehru's quote: "There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi also felt closest to Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru among Indian leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev was deeply impressed by Nehru's Moscow tour in 1955, finding it an unexpected inspiration amidst Soviet propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

### Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)

Nehru's commitment to India's past thinking, characterized by peace and non-alignment, became a cornerstone of his foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. He believed in not siding with either the Western or Eastern bloc, famously stating, "Do the Asian and African nations have no other position than being pro-communist or anti-communist?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

The groundwork for NAM began with the Bandung Conference in Indonesia in 1955, where Nehru spoke out against colonial subjugation and the need for Asian and African nations to assert their own ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. Despite offers of a permanent UN Security Council seat from both the US and the Soviet Union, Nehru chose to lead a third group, rather than weaken the UN or risk another war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

This decision's impact was evident in the second NAM conference in Cairo (1964) with 57 attending countries, and today, 120 countries are part of the Non-Aligned Movement, which remains relevant even amidst current global conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Through NAM, India showed a new way to the world, becoming a global leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

### Opposition to Apartheid and African Support

Nehru openly spoke against apartheid in Africa, recognizing the continent's "infinite tragedy" of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. He established scholarships for Africans, leading to over 600 African students studying in Indian universities by 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Many of these students later became prominent leaders in their respective countries, such as John Samuel Malecela (Prime Minister of Tanzania), Olusegun Obasanjo (President of Nigeria), and Bingu wa Mutharika (President of Malawi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

## Current Government's Stance and Actions

The current government is criticized for its lack of a clear conscience and vision, hindering India's potential global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. While America comments on India's democracy, India does not reciprocate on issues like racism and police brutality in the US (e.g., George Floyd's murder), due to its own human rights record being questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

Despite claims of stopping wars, the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts continue, and domestic violence in Manipur remains unresolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

The current government's actions regarding India's soft power are also questioned:
*   Olympic medal-winning wrestlers had to protest for days to file an FIR against a BJP leader accused of sexual exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
*   An actor from B-grade films, Gajendra Chauhan, was appointed chairman of the Film Institute Pune, leading to student protests and disciplinary action against future Cannes Grand Prix winner Payal Kapadia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.
*   The removal of evolution from syllabi and the encouragement of pseudoscience further undermine India's intellectual standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

Ultimately, the argument is made that instead of trying to pull down historical figures like Nehru, the current leadership should strive to raise its own level to match India's true potential and past global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. The attempts to defame Nehru through [[criticism_of_indian_media_and_fake_news | fake news]] and [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | media narratives]] are highlighted as counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

Research suggests that a child deprived of a father's love, whether due to absence or an excessively strict upbringing, can develop psychological issues that evolve into severe problems in adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Studies indicate that a father's absence diminishes a child's self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, while harsh parenting is linked to aggressive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Low self-confidence and aggression are common traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, and the absence of a caring father can contribute to someone becoming a criminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Psychological Roots of Harmful Behavior

Following the 2012 Nirbhaya case, Clinical Psychology Master's student Madhumita Pandey surveyed 122 convicted rapists and 65 convicted murderers in Tihar jail to understand their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. A stark difference emerged: most murderers expressed some regret for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, but many convicted rapists exhibited a lack of remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This was consistent with the documentary 'India's Daughter,' where an assailant justified his actions by questioning why the victim was out late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

To understand this lack of regret, Madhumita administered the Multicultural Masculinity Ideology Scale (MMIS) and an Attitude Towards Women Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The results showed these individuals held highly regressive views about women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This finding is supported by other researchers, including Susan Brownmiller's 1975 book 'Against Our Will, Men, Women, and Rape,' which emphasized that rape is a form of intimidation driven by a desire to assert power and dominance over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Researchers like Richard Johnson, Danielle Cusmano, and Rebecca Whisnant concluded that rape is not driven by unrestrained desire but by a need to display power, an outlet for anger, and sadistic cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. A common thread among these motives is the perpetrators' belief in the inferiority of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Environmental and Media Influence

The question arises: where does this regressive thinking originate? The answer is "everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A person's behavior, personality, and identity are molded by their surroundings, including parental care, interactions with relatives, school experiences, and exposure to their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

Mass media plays a major role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. News, books, radio, TV ads, social media content, songs, and movies significantly influence the formation of a person's identity and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. While some aspects of life are consciously controlled, everything has a subconscious effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### The Cumulative Effect of Media Exposure
The argument that watching violent films doesn't make one violent is often made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Sandeep Vanga Reddy, director of 'Kabir Singh,' made a similar argument, stating that watching gangster movies like 'Gyang Leader,' 'Parinda,' 'Ram Lakhan,' or 'Tezaab' didn't turn him or his brother into gangsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. However, this is likened to arguing that one unhealthy meal won't cause a heart attack; continuous exposure to unhealthy content can have a cumulative negative effect over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Changes are made in small increments, and each droplet adds up to create the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

If a child, Munnu, grows up in an environment where his father beats his mother, his sister faces restrictive rules not applicable to him, and he follows YouTubers who [[misogyny_and_objectification_in_media | objectify women]], stating they are only for household chores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. He follows creators like Andrew Tate, a symbol of [[perceptions_of_masculinity_and_alpha_males | toxic masculinity and misogyny]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Songs with lyrics like "I am a tandoori chicken, eat me with alcohol" or "I am a womanizer" further contribute to the [[misogyny_and_objectification_in_media | objectification of women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. UNICEF highlights an American Psychological Association report on how such [[misogyny_and_objectification_in_media | objectification in mass media]] contributes to [[critique_of_violence_in_cinema_and_its_societal_effects | violence against women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. News channels and TV ads also perpetuate the [[misogyny_and_objectification_in_media | narrative of women's objectification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Critique of Glorified Violence and Misogyny in Films

When Munnu then watches films like 'Animal,' where the protagonist violently twists his wife's arm, grabs her neck, and points a gun at her, it becomes part of this toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Some argue such actions are justified because the wife slapped him, which highlights the core issue: the glorification of violence, regardless of gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Director Sandeep Vanga Reddy has stated that love is not genuine unless partners have the liberty of slapping each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. In 'Animal,' the protagonist, Rannvijay, commits mass murders, yet his wife never considers leaving him; instead, she encourages him to kill another woman when he has an extramarital affair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Despite being a father, Rannvijay mocks menstruation, declares it a "man's world," and demands his lover lick his shoe to prove her love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The film attributes his behavior to "daddy issues" but shows no redemption or positive transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Ranbir Kapoor's acting fails to convey mental illness, leading to the [[misogyny_and_objectification_in_media | glorification of misogyny]] and [[perceptions_of_masculinity_and_alpha_males | toxic masculinity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The protagonist performs these acts with utmost confidence, almost like an [[perceptions_of_masculinity_and_alpha_males | alpha male]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Such films are considered "cancerous" to society, contributing to a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The film's poster, featuring the hero smoking, reinforces this problematic messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Intentional Violence and Fan Reaction
Sandeep Vanga Reddy intentionally aimed to make 'Animal' more violent than 'Kabir Singh' to "push the boundaries of violence in cinema" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Fans enthusiastically share clips of his statements, validating his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
When films like 'Kabir Singh' and 'Animal' are criticized, some fans react with outrage, seeing it as a criticism of their own personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, illustrating [[selective_outrage_and_media_narratives_in_india | selective outrage and media narratives in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## The Business of Violence in Cinema

The underlying reason for excessive bloodshed in films is that [[critique_of_violence_in_cinema_and_its_societal_effects | violence sells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Aamir Khan noted that creatively untalented directors heavily depend on violence and sex to make their films work, a trend seen in both Bollywood and Hollywood, giving rise to "Slasher films" or "Gore films" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

There is a psychological reason why some people enjoy watching extreme [[critique_of_violence_in_cinema_and_its_societal_effects | violence and bloodshed]] on screen: these individuals often feel powerless and repressed in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. By envisioning themselves as the violent protagonist, they find satisfaction in the violence directed towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. 'Animal' takes this to an extreme, with the protagonist engaging in prolonged, stylized bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Such characters would be labeled psychopaths in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, yet the film dismisses the idea of mental illness, prioritizing continuous bloodshed for box office revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

While films can portray violence realistically to highlight its negative impact, such films often struggle at the box office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Anurag Kashyap's works like 'Ugly' and 'That Girl in Yellow Boots' offer social commentary, but audiences are repelled by violence inflicted by villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Instead, the audience's "repressed self" seeks entertainment, craving violence from the hero's standpoint, wanting to imagine themselves as characters like James Bond, Kill Bill, or the protagonist from 'Animal' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Directors capitalize on this demand, leading to a flood of violent action films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Alternative Models of Masculinity

The contrast between 'Animal' and 'Sam Bahadur,' released on the same day, highlights differing ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, a real-life hero who fought for his country and humanity, should be a symbol of masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Similarly, Lord Ram, with qualities like humility and compassion despite his strength, should be an ideal model of masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

However, some individuals reject such models because they lack compassion and empathy themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Characters like Kabir Singh and Rannvijay in Sandeep Vanga's films exemplify a lack of self-control, resorting to shouting, beating, and threats when angered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. Those who appreciate such regressive characters now call themselves "[[perceptions_of_masculinity_and_alpha_males | Alpha Males]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

To combat this destructive way of thinking, individuals should stop watching such films and respect their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Films like 'Animal' are indeed "cancerous to our society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

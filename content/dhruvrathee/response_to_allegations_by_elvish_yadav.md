From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

This article addresses allegations made by [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] in his videos, framing them as a response to his "rubbish" and "lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The speaker asserts that this video serves as the definitive answer to [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]]'s repeated demands for a counter-reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Characterization of Elvish Yadav's Content
The speaker describes [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]]'s video content using a Haryanvi saying: "A Bitouda can give you cow dung only," implying its low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] is positioned as the "true leader of these idiots" among right-wing YouTubers who have attacked the speaker with insults like "dog" or "cockroach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The speaker highlights [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]]'s "sheer amount of inappropriate things" and "lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Other YouTubers have already countered [[critique_of_elvish_yadavs_youtube_content | Elvish's claims]], including allegations that the speaker said "anyone who wears saffron colour is a terrible person," which is clarified to refer only to those who misuse the symbol for violence or insult Lord Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Concerns are raised about [[critique_of_elvish_yadavs_youtube_content | Elvish's alleged activities]], such as "ruining childhoods," "promoting gambling apps," "making videos while intoxicated," and "spoiling the social environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The speaker contrasts this with "educated YouTubers" who lead by example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Allegation: Labeling as "Anti-National"
The speaker observes that the BJP and its supporters often label critics as "anti-national," a strategy employed by [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] against the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This tactic involves connecting various critics to the speaker to ultimately declare the speaker "anti-national" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Allegation: Fabricated Connection to Aadil Aman
[[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] claimed that the speaker created a Facebook group in 2020 where Aadil Aman was an admin, and that they were "old friends" who "worked for AAP together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Response
*   The Facebook group ("Dhruv Rathee Squad") was created in 2017, not 2020, and was deleted by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   Admins were chosen based on Facebook activity, not personal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   One admin, Aadil Aman, was removed for making violent and extremist comments not supported by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   The group was shut down around 2020-21 to prevent future blame for user content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]]'s claim of friendship between the speaker and Aadil Aman is baseless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Counter-Allegation: BJP's Questionable Connections
The speaker turns the argument of "guilt by association" back on the BJP and its supporters, citing numerous instances of Prime Minister Modi and BJP leaders associating with individuals involved in controversial or criminal activities, while his followers perform "mental gymnastics" to defend him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

*   **Social Media Accounts**: PM Modi followed Twitter users (e.g., Nikhil, BJP 2016 page, BJP 2014, Avinash Choubey, CoolAditaya, MahaveerM) who posted "foul language," "disgraceful words," and "threatening and abusive" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Hosting Trolls**: PM Modi hosted violent and abusive trolls (Ankit Jain, Suresh Nakhua, Tajinder Bagga) at his official residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Religious Leaders**:
    *   PM Modi garlanded and touched the feet of Asaram, who was convicted of rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   PM Modi praised Gurmeet Ram Rahim, found guilty in murder and rape cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Haryana's ex-chief minister was also photographed with Gurmeet Ram Rahim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Alleged Terrorist Links**:
    *   Dhruv Saxena, wearing a BJP banner and Modi-promoting t-shirt, was among 11 people arrested by Madhya Pradesh's Anti-terrorist squad for allegedly spying for Pakistan's ISI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He was photographed with former MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   Talib Hussain, former chief of J&K BJP's Minority Morcha IT Cell, was one of two terrorists caught in Jammu's Reasi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   Monu Manesar, an accused in the killing of Nasir and Junaid, was photographed with Anurag Thakur, Arun Jaitley, and Amit Shah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   Pragya Thakur, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast case, was photographed with PM Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

The speaker provides a partial list of other BJP members or associates with controversial actions: Babu Bajrangi, Yashwant Shinde, Prajwal Ravenna, Ashish Mishra, Anurag Thakur, Yati Narsimhanand Saraswati, Surajpal Ammu, Suresh Chavhanke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. These individuals are associated with gun violence, lynching, calling rapists "cultured Brahmins," and calls for genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The speaker challenges [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] to address these cases instead of targeting him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Allegation: Connection to George Soros and Harsh Mander

### Response to George Soros Claims
[[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] propagated the idea that George Soros is a "dangerous" figure linked to "conspiracy theories" who invested to overthrow PM Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> and that the speaker receives funding from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

The speaker explains that George Soros is a Hungarian-American billionaire, investor, and philanthropist who founded the Open Society Foundation (OSF) to promote "open society" principles like democratic governance and freedom of expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Key facts about OSF's presence and activities in India:
*   Established in India in 1999 during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's premiership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   Initially offered scholarships and fellowships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   Began India-specific grant-making in 2014, supporting local organizations in areas like disability, public services, justice reform, and medicine access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   Funded ventures like Neo Growth and Capital Float (renamed Axio), which provided affordable financing to over 40,000 small Indian businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

The speaker highlights direct links between George Soros's funded entities and BJP figures:
*   Gaurav Hinduja, co-founder of Capital Float/Axio, is followed by BJP leader Kapil Mishra on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   Shashank Rishyasringa's (co-founder of Capital Float/Axio) marriage was attended by Kokilaben Ambani, BJP leader Lal Krishan Advani, and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   An Indian Express investigation showed that 68 OSF projects worldwide are funded by the UN Democracy Fund, to which India is the fourth-highest contributor. This implies indirect funding of George Soros by the Modi government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

George Soros's wider views and actions include:
*   Criticism of China's Xi Jinping and the Belt and Road Initiative, calling Xi the "most dangerous opponent for open societies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   Closure of OSF's Pakistan branch in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   Efforts to end racism and address income inequality in America, advocating for wealth tax on the rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

The core issue for BJP supporters is that George Soros "expressed concerns over India's eroding democracy" and [[criticisms_of_modis_claims_and_portrayal | criticised Narendra Modi]] regarding the Adani crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. As "Modi is India" for his ecosystem, criticism of Modi is deemed "anti-India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Response to Fori Nehru Claim
[[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] falsely claimed a connection between George Soros and "Rahul Gandhi's aunt, Fori Nehru," asserting she was a "threat to our nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. The speaker points out that Fori Nehru passed away in 2017 at the age of 108 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This "breaking news" was based on a 14-year-old article from 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

### Response to Amrit Singh Claim
Similarly, [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] spread misinformation about former PM Dr. Manmohan Singh's daughter, Amrit Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. A 2013 article noted her award for human rights law and her work with the Open Society Justice Initiative on a report about CIA torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Seven years later, pro-BJP websites published this as "breaking news," despite her no longer working for OSF and now being a law professor at Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

### Response to Harsh Mander Claims
[[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] claimed Harsh Mander works for George Soros's Open Society Foundation and is "anti-national" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. He also incorrectly pronounced Mander's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

The speaker clarifies Harsh Mander's background:
*   Former IAS officer, District Head in 6 districts, Divisional Commissioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   Took voluntary retirement in 2002 in opposition to the Gujarat riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
*   Authored 24 books and numerous columns in major newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   Shyam Benegal's film *Samar* is based on his stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   Lectured at prestigious universities like IIM Ahmedabad and MIT Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   Member of the National Advisory Council of the UPA government (2010-2012), contributing to bills like RTI, Right to Education, and Food Security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   Ran the "Karwan-e-Mohabbat" campaign against lynchings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   Received multiple human rights and harmony awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

The speaker clarifies he has never met or spoken to Harsh Mander and only researched him after [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish's video]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

[[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] attempted to link the speaker to Harsh Mander by claiming the speaker's videos on CAA and Manipur were "inspired" by Mander's tweets, citing specific dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. The speaker refutes this by showing his first CAA video was uploaded five days *before* Mander's tweet, and that top YouTubers naturally cover major news topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The Manipur video was made due to widespread public outrage over a specific incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

### Elvish's Mistake: Two Aadil Amans
To connect the speaker to Harsh Mander, [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] claimed that the Aadil Aman from the speaker's Facebook group now lives in Germany and works with Harsh Mander's NGO, Karwan-e-Mohabbat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] used a Facebook profile as "proof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

The speaker reveals [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] confused two different people named Aadil Aman due to a spelling difference in their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. The *other* Aadil Aman, a researcher in Germany, issued a public statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>:
*   His name was misused by [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   He denied making the attributed comment or organizing any protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
*   His Facebook profile was used to fabricate a link between Harsh Mander (his former employer) and the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.
*   This defamation led to abusive messages and threats to him and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   His lawyer sent a legal notice to [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] on June 3rd, demanding video deletion and clarification within 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   As of the video, a legal case for defamation and threatening safety is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

### Elvish's Mistake: Harmandar Singh vs. Harsh Mander
[[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] showed an article, underlining a line that stated Harsh Mander's parents worked for the British police in Tanzania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. However, the article actually referred to a "Captain Harmandar Singh," not Mander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Captain Harmandar Singh was a brave officer who helped protect the Dalai Lama in 1959 and received a Padma Shri in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. The speaker reveals that Harsh Mander is actually the son of Captain Harmandar Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

## Legal Ramifications and Future Content
The speaker warns [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] not to "play the victim card" or "cry on a news channel" if legal cases are filed against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. He mentions that Harsh Mander, Amrit Singh, and he himself can file defamation cases against [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

The speaker highlights [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]]'s own "questionable links," such as supporting Akhilesh Yadav (an alliance partner of Rahul Gandhi, whom [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] labeled "anti-national") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. He also points out [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]]'s numerous connections and photographs with BJP politicians, suggesting that similar "anti-national" labels could be applied to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

The speaker concludes by stating that this video covered only a small portion of [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]]'s lies, promising a future video to address other allegations like spreading fake information, sharing pornographic content, promoting fake coins, and having links with the Aam Aadmi Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

## Advice for YouTubers
The speaker advises shallow YouTubers like [[elvish_yadav_controversies_and_criticisms | Elvish Yadav]] that building a sustainable YouTube career requires providing "genuine value" to the audience, not just creating [[claims_of_spreading_hatred_and_misinformation | controversies for views and money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. He mentions his "YouTube Blueprint" course as an alternative to "promoting gambling and betting apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

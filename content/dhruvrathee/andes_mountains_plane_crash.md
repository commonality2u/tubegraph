On October 12, 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, a small chartered aircraft departed from Uruguay, South America, headed for Santiago, the capital of Chile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The plane carried 45 passengers, including a rugby team, their family, and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The flight, typically three hours long, involved crossing the vast Andes Mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The Andes, the world's longest mountain range, contains some of the highest mountains outside the Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This event is also known as the [[the_miracle_of_the_andes | Miracle of the Andes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, and is specifically the [[survival_story_of_uruguayan_air_force_flight_571 | story of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Initial Delay and Crash Events

Due to a storm in the mountains on October 12, the pilots decided to land midway in Mendoza, Argentina, to wait for better weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The plane took off again on October 13 at 2:18 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, after pilots confirmed clear weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Around 3:21 p.m., while descending near Santiago, the plane encountered severe turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Thick clouds obscured visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Alarms and warning lights activated, but the rugby players on board initially did not take the turbulence seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

As clouds cleared, a passenger saw the plane was perilously close to a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Pilots realized they were moving towards a huge rock and attempted to lift the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The aircraft's ground collision alarm blared as they put maximum power into gaining altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

However, it was too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>:
*   The rear of the aircraft collided with the mountain, causing the entire rear portion to separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Two rows of seats and three passengers flew out of the plane and disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   After a few seconds of continued flight, the plane's left wing broke off, and more passengers fell out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   The remaining front section of the plane plummeted into a glacier, sliding at 350 km/h before crashing after a 700-meter drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The cockpit was crushed, killing the pilots instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The wreckage lay on an unknown mountain in the Andes at a height of 3,570 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Surprisingly, 33 of the 45 people on board were still alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The plane was later found to be 80 km off its planned route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Initial Survival and Search Efforts

Among the survivors were 19-year-old Roberto Canessa and 20-year-old Gustavo Zerbino, both medical students, who immediately began assisting the injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Many sustained severe injuries, including 23-year-old Fernando Parrado, who was in a coma from a skull fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Within an hour of the plane's disappearance, the Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service was notified, deploying four aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. They searched unsuccessfully until nightfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Rescue officers concluded the aircraft crashed in a remote, inaccessible area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The plane's white color made it nearly impossible to spot against the snow and ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

On the night of October 13, five injured passengers succumbed to the cold, reducing the number of survivors from 33 to 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Survivors used the plane's fuselage as a shelter, sealing openings with luggage, seats, and snow for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The next day, October 14, 11 aircraft from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay joined the search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Although the search area was correct, the crash site remained undiscovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Survivors tried to write "SOS" on the roof with lipstick and make a cross in the snow with suitcases, but their efforts went unnoticed by three overhead aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

On October 15, survivor Fito Strauch devised a method to obtain water by using a metal sheet as a solar collector to melt snow, collecting droplets in empty wine bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Seat cushions were used as snowshoes, and wool from seat covers provided insulation from the cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

On October 16, three days after the crash, Fernando Parrado awoke from his coma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He found his mother dead and his 19-year-old sister severely injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Eight days after the crash, his sister also died from her injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

On October 21, eight days after the crash, search and rescue teams officially ceased their operations after 142 hours, believing no one could have survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Desperate Measures

Survivors found a transistor radio among the wreckage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Rugby player Roy Harley, an electronics enthusiast, managed to get it working by improvising a long antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Eleven days after the crash, they tuned into a broadcast announcing the cancellation of the search operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

> "Feeling that their world is alive and they consider you dead." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>

By the 11th day, food supplies were nearly exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Initial provisions included 8 chocolate bars, 1 tin of mussels, 3 small jars of jam, a jar of almonds, a box of peanuts, some dates, candies, dried plums, and a few bottles of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. They had rationed food, with Parrado reportedly eating one chocolate-covered peanut over three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. At 3,800 meters altitude, there were no trees, plants, or animals to hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Attempts to eat cotton and leather from seats only made them sicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Facing starvation, the survivors made the difficult decision to consume the bodies of their deceased friends and family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Roberto Canessa was the first to try this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Though some initially refused, two days later, with no other option, they all chose to eat human meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Further Adversity: The Avalanche

On October 29, 16 days after the crash, a loud rumble signaled an avalanche that buried the broken plane in snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Eight more people were lost in the snow and suffocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, leaving only 19 survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

> "Ted, Roberto, you had it. You're going to d!e. That's it. A very nice sensation of heat between my legs because I was peeing on myself and saying that's it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>

The remaining 19 were trapped in a small space under the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Parrado used a metal pole to create a ventilation hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. After two days of digging a tunnel, they managed to reach the surface, only to find a snowstorm approaching, forcing them back into the snow cave for three more days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## The Expedition for Help

Upon emerging, the survivors realized no one was coming to save them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Parrado, Canessa, and Vizintin, the strongest among them, decided to seek help themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. They were given extra food and the warmest clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

Their initial estimation was that they were only a few kilometers from Chilean countryside, based on the co-pilot's earlier statement about passing Curico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. In reality, the crash site was 89 km east, deep in the Andes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

On November 15, 33 days after the crash, the three set out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Traveling east, they found the plane's rear section, containing suitcases, chocolate boxes, meat patties, a bottle of rum, extra clothes, comic books, medicines, and crucially, the aircraft's two-way radio system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. They decided to attempt to use the radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. They found heavy 24 kg batteries in the tail section, too heavy to carry back to the main fuselage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. With Roy Harley's help, they tried to operate the radio there, but it failed because the aircraft's electrical system ran on 115V AC, while the battery was 24V DC, with no means to connect them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. They realized they had to walk westward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

On December 11, 59 days after the crash, another avalanche struck, killing three more survivors, leaving only 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

To survive the -30° Celsius nights during their westward climb, an 18-year-old survivor, Carlos Miguel Rodriguez, used his sewing kit to stitch together pieces of clothing to create a large sleeping bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

> "I had the idea that with the insulation, you can make a sleeping bag. But I not only had the idea, I made it myself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>

On December 12, two months after the crash, Parrado, Canessa, and Vizintin began their climb up the glacier without mountaineering gear, maps, or compasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. They packed a three-day supply of meat, still believing they were only a few days walk from help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Parrado wore three pairs of jeans, three sweaters, four pairs of socks, and a plastic shopping bag over his socks to combat the extreme cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. They used their stitched sleeping bag at night, sleeping closely for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

By the fourth day, they realized their estimation was wrong, as the journey seemed endless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. With dwindling food, Vizintin returned to the crash site on December 15, using an aircraft seat as a sleigh to descend in an hour a distance that took them three days to climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Parrado and Canessa continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

After three more hours, they reached the peak, only to see endless snowy mountains in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

> "I couldn't breathe. I couldn't speak, I couldn't even think because what we saw was horrible. Instead of green valleys, we saw mountains and snow-covered peaks 360° around us, to the horizon, all around us." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>

Parrado spotted two snow-free mountain peaks on the far western horizon, which gave them a direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. They continued hiking for many days, eventually reaching a valley with a flowing river, which offered a downhill path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

## Rescue and Aftermath

After trekking for nine days, on December 20, they spotted cows in fields, indicating human presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. On the other side of the river, they saw three men on horseback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. Parrado shouted, but the river's noise drowned him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. One man, Chilean farmer Sergio Catalan, spotted them and shouted "Tomorrow!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

The next day, Catalan returned with paper and pencil, attaching them to a stone and throwing them across the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Parrado wrote a message in Spanish, explaining he was from a plane that crashed in the mountains, had been walking for 10 days from Uruguay, and his injured friends were at the crash site, needing urgent help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Catalan understood and, after confirming the vague news of a plane crash months ago with his friends, was shocked to learn of survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. He threw bread to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

Catalan then rode horseback for 10 hours westward to the nearest city to inform the army command, who contacted Santiago headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. Farmers brought Parrado and Canessa to Los Maitenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. It was determined that they had hiked 61 km on foot over the last 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>; Canessa had lost half his body weight, weighing only 44 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Their story became international news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

The Chilean Air Force dispatched three helicopters to rescue the remaining survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Army officers interviewed Parrado and Canessa for the location. Parrado, having brought the pilot's flight chart and plotted their hiking path, accompanied the army officers in a helicopter to locate the crash site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

On December 22, 1972, 70 days after the crash, two search and rescue helicopters reached the survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. In total, 16 survivors were rescued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. Despite conditions like altitude sickness, dehydration, broken bones, and malnutrition, all recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

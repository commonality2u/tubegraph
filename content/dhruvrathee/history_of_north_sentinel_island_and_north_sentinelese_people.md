North Sentinel Island is home to the North Sentinelese tribe, believed to be among the world's last [[uncontacted_tribes_and_their_isolation | uncontacted tribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This means they possess minimal knowledge of the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The island and its inhabitants have a long history of isolation, marked by a strong resistance to outside contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Geography and Demographics

North Sentinel Island is part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, an archipelago consisting of 572 islands, of which only 38 are inhabited and 12 are open to tourists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The island is small, approximately 60 kmÂ² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, and densely covered by forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. It is located about 50 km from Port Blair, the capital of South Andaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The exact population of the North Sentinelese is unknown, with Indian government estimates ranging from 50 to 500 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. John Allen Chau's diary estimated around 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

## Origins and Lifestyle

It is believed that the North Sentinelese are direct descendants of early modern humans who migrated out of Africa around 70,000 years ago, a phenomenon known as the 'Out of Africa' theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. While other groups mixed as they spread across continents, those who settled on remote islands, such as the Sentinelese, remained isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The North Sentinelese are thought to have arrived on the island 10,000 to 30,000 years ago and have been cut off from the rest of the world ever since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Their isolation means they never developed agriculture, which was discovered about 12,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This makes them one of the last Stone Age tribes, maintaining a hunter-gatherer lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. They gather fruits, hunt animals like wild boars, and fish for food, also utilizing honey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

## Historical Encounters

The history of interaction with the North Sentinelese is predominantly marked by their fierce protection of their isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Early Accounts (2nd to 11th Century AD)

The oldest written record concerning the Andaman and Nicobar Islands dates to the 2nd century AD, when Roman mathematician Claudius Ptolemy described them as the "Islands of Cannibals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Similar accounts from Chinese travelers in 673 AD and Arab travelers during the 8th and 9th centuries also referred to the islanders as cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. In the 11th century, inscriptions during Raja Raja Chola I's reign also mentioned these islands as impure due to belief in cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. However, modern observations confirm that the North Sentinelese are not cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

### First Specific Mentions (1771-1867)

The first specific record of North Sentinel Island appeared in 1771 when an East India Company ship's surveyor spotted light on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. In 1867, an Indian merchant ship carrying about 100 passengers was shipwrecked on the island's shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The survivors were attacked by the Sentinelese but were rescued by the British Royal Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This incident marks the first recorded instance of the North Sentinelese driving out outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Maurice Vidal Portman's Expedition (1880)

In 1880, British officer Maurice Vidal Portman attempted to "civilize" the Sentinelese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. He brought members of other Andamanese tribes, but their languages were too different for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Portman then kidnapped an old couple and four children, taking them to Port Blair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The old couple died within days due to lack of immunity to outside diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Portman returned the children to the island with gifts, but it is believed they likely introduced foreign germs, causing potential fatalities among the tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This incident is considered a significant reason for the Sentinelese's violent behavior towards outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### [[Efforts to contact North Sentinel Island and their impact | Official Indian Expeditions]] (1967-1990s)

The Indian government conducted several expeditions to the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>:
*   **1967:** Triloknath Pandit, the first official anthropologist to visit the island, led a 20-member team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. They found no inhabitants but left gifts like coconuts, pots, pans, and iron tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **1970:** An official research team placed a stone tablet claiming North Sentinel Island as Indian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **1974:** An Indian film crew, accompanied by Triloknath Pandit and armed forces, filmed a documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. They left coconuts and a live pig as gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The tribe attacked them with bows and arrows, injuring the director, and killed and buried the pig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This was the first time the North Sentinelese were captured on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   Throughout the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, Pandit made numerous attempts, consistently encountering violence or hostility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Gifts like pigs and dolls were repeatedly shot with arrows and buried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### MV Primrose Shipwreck (1981)

In 1981, the merchant ship Primrose, en route from Bangladesh to Australia, ran aground on the island during a storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The Sentinelese attacked the passengers, but due to weather, their arrows missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The crew was rescued a week later by helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This event marked the first time the tribe encountered iron, which they scavenged from the ship and began using in their bows and arrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. The shipwreck is still visible on Google Maps north of the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Brief Friendly Contact (1991)

In January 1991, an expedition led by Indian anthropologist Madhumala Chattopadhyay made the first recorded friendly contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Her unarmed team offered coconuts, and the Sentinelese accepted them without violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The next day, a Sentinelese woman intervened to prevent a man from shooting arrows at the team, allowing the expedition members to hand coconuts directly to the tribe members for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. A month later, Triloknath Pandit and Madhumala Chattopadhyay returned, again experiencing peaceful contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. However, this period of friendliness was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Return to Hostility and Government Policy (1997-Present)

After 1991, subsequent [[Efforts to contact North Sentinel Island and their impact | attempts to contact the Sentinelese]] were met with violence again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Consequently, the Indian government banned visits to the island after 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The government adopted an "Eyes-On, Hands-Off" policy, monitoring the tribe from a distance and providing assistance only if necessary, without direct contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

*   **2004 Tsunami:** Following a devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean, Indian Coast Guard officials flew over the island to check on the Sentinelese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. They were met with a shower of arrows, indicating the tribe had survived unharmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. The island itself was lifted by 1.5 meters due to the tsunami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **2006 Fishermen Deaths:** Two local fishermen inadvertently got too close to the island and were killed by the Sentinelese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Following this, the government established a 5 km exclusion zone around the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **2018 John Allen Chau Incident:** In November 2018, John Allen Chau, a 26-year-old American missionary, illegally traveled to North Sentinel Island with the intent to teach Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He bribed a fisherman to take him near the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. On his first attempt, he was met by men with bows and arrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. On a second attempt, after leaving gifts, a child shot him with an arrow, which luckily struck his Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Despite writing in his diary, "I don't want to die. I should go back," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> he returned to the island on November 16, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. He did not return, and the fishermen who took him witnessed the Sentinelese burying a body, which they identified as Chau's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. In a letter to his family, he stated, "If I get killed, please, do not blame these people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Characteristics of the North Sentinelese

Information about the North Sentinelese is scarce, primarily gathered from brief observations and John Allen Chau's diary.
*   **Physical Appearance:** They are typically 5'3" to 5'5" tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Video footage shows them with short hair, shining dark skin, and well-defined muscles, with no signs of obesity or malnutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Some individuals had yellow paste on their faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Attire and Tools:** They do not wear clothes but use fiber strings on their head, neck, and loins; women wear thinner strings, men thicker bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Men carry bows, arrows, and spears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Navigation:** They build small, narrow wooden canoes, less than 2 feet wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Despite this, they show little curiosity about their surroundings, never attempting to visit the nearest inhabited island, only 36 km away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Language:** Their language is unique and cannot be understood by outsiders, including members of other Andamanese tribes like the Onge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. John Chau noted their language contains many high-pitched sounds such as "ba," "pa," "la," and "sa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **Shelter:** They live in two types of houses: large huts for multiple families and smaller huts for single families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Practices:** They bury their dead on the beach under the sand rather than cremating them or taking them into the jungle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. They attack small groups of visitors but tend to hide in the forest if the visiting party is large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Observations of pregnant women and children suggest their population is self-sustaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Sustainability:** The North Sentinelese live sustainably on their small island, coexisting harmoniously with nature without deforestation or overpopulation, which is rare among human communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## [[Debate on modern contact with isolated tribes | Debate on Contact and Isolation]]

There is an ongoing [[debate_on_modern_contact_with_isolated_tribes | debate]] regarding whether to pursue further contact with the North Sentinelese.

### Arguments for Contact
Some argue that continued [[Efforts to contact North Sentinel Island and their impact | efforts to establish contact]] are necessary to introduce them to modern technologies and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Arguments for Isolation
Conversely, many advocate for protecting the North Sentinelese from the outside world, allowing them to remain in their peaceful isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Key reasons for this stance include:
*   **Disease:** Outsiders carry diseases against which the Sentinelese have no immunity, potentially leading to widespread fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Past Failures:** Historical attempts to integrate other tribes have had negative consequences. For example, the Jarawa tribe in Andaman, after successful friendly contact in the 1970s, faced issues adapting to modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Some struggled with packaged food, leading to obesity, while the introduction of substances like tobacco and alcohol resulted in addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
*   **Cultural Erosion:** Integration often leads to the loss of traditional culture, lifestyle, language, and customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. The Great Andamanese Tribe, which numbered around 5,000 in the 1800s when the British first colonized the islands, now has only 41 remaining members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

The policy of allowing the North Sentinelese to remain isolated is viewed as the best approach to prevent the eradication of their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

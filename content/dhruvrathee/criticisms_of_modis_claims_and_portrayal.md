Prime Minister Narendra Modi's public image and various claims about his background and character have faced significant [[controversies_and_criticism_surrounding_narendra_modi | criticism]]. Critics argue that his portrayal is a result of widespread emotional manipulation and brainwashing, orchestrated by a "mafia" operating in four key departments: instilling pride, victimisation narratives, fear-mongering, and presenting Modi as a messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This article focuses on the criticisms surrounding his personal claims and public [[narendra_modis_image_and_cult_of_personality | cult of personality]].

## Exaggerated Poverty Claims

Narendra Modi has often presented himself as originating from an "extremely poor family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, stating that he "used to sell tea in trains" in his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This "chaiwala" (tea seller) narrative has been a significant part of his public image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, even told to *Time* magazine in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

However, these claims have been questioned:
*   **Childhood Photos** Critics point to his childhood photos, where he is seen wearing suits, questioning if a child from an "extremely poor family" in the 1950s would have such attire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. His old home, though not large, is also described as not resembling that of an "extremely poor family" of the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Brother's Statement** His younger brother, Prahlad Modi, stated that all five brothers helped their father, who sold tea all his life. He clarified that Narendra Modi should be called the "son of a tea seller," not a tea seller himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Canteen Contractor Claim** In 2014, Congress leader Ahmad Patel claimed Modi was a canteen contractor rather than a tea seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This claim was "unintentionally acknowledged" in 2021 when Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw instructed officials to beautify a canteen at Vadnagar railway station, which was run by Modi's father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Biographer's View** Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, who wrote a biography on Modi in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, has clarified that Modi's claims of poverty are "grossly exaggerated" and "taken out of proportion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Mukhopadhyay noted that Modi's father had enough money to send his sons to school, meaning Modi could only help out occasionally after school, not work full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Purpose of Narrative** According to Mukhopadhyay, these exaggerated stories are intended to sell an idea to the Indian public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Critics argue that a leader's background (poor or rich) does not determine their effectiveness, citing examples of dictators like Pol Pot (rich family), Benito Mussolini (poor family), Joseph Stalin (poor family), and Adolf Hitler (poor family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The article notes that despite humble origins, Hitler ran "money-grabbing schemes" benefiting crony capitalist companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## "Faqir" Persona vs. Lavish Lifestyle

Modi frequently portrays himself as a "faqir" (holy beggar) who will leave with "only the bare minimum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. He has also claimed to have "begged for food" for 35 or 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

Critics highlight a contrast between this image and his apparent lifestyle:
*   **Expensive Items** He is seen wearing sunglasses worth ₹140,000 and traveling in a ₹120 million Mercedes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Foreign Tours and Early Tech** Despite claiming to live on charity, he could afford foreign tours in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, visiting places like Paris, Washington D.C., Hollywood, London, and Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. He also claimed to have used a digital camera in 1987-1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, before the first commercially available digital camera (Dycam Model 1) was released in the US in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Frequent Outfit Changes** In contrast to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who reportedly had only two sets of outfits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, Modi is noted for changing outfits multiple times a day during official visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. His "fancy dress collection" and collection of headwear have been highlighted by media outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Abandoning Family as an "Achievement"

Modi and his supporters often promote the idea that he abandoned his family for the nation as an achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This narrative includes abandoning his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Critics challenge this portrayal:
*   **Personal Choice vs. Achievement** The article argues that a couple not living together is a personal matter and not an achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. It points out that other national figures like Lal Bahadur Shastri and Mahatma Jyotirao Phule (whose wife was Savitribai Phule) made significant contributions to the nation without abandoning their spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **WhatsApp University's "Anti-Woman Mentality"** The narrative is characterized as an "anti-woman mentality" from "WhatsApp University," where women are seen as hindrances and abandoning one's wife is glorified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Buddha** While some compare Modi to Lord Buddha, who left his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, the article highlights that Buddha's purpose was not to "spread hatred" or "get more power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Buddha, upon enlightenment, sought to thank his wife Yashodhara, acknowledging her support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Engagement with Elites vs. Family** Modi regularly attends weddings and events of Bollywood celebrities and oligarchs like Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Yet, he was absent from his nephew's engagement in October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. His family members, including his brother Prahlad Modi and niece Sonal Modi, have stated that they are instructed to "stay away" and were not invited to his oath ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. This contrasts with the G20 theme "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" (One Earth, One Family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, and the image of Lord Ram who lived with and loved his family while serving his subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## Divine/Superhero Portrayal

Modi has been frequently compared to God or presented as a "superhero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Divine Comparisons** Numerous politicians have called him "God's gift to India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, "God incarnate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, and even "Lord Ram has taken birth as PM Modi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Temples dedicated to Narendra Modi have been built in Pune, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
*   **Historical Parallels (Hitler)** The article draws a parallel to Adolf Hitler, who was also compared to Jesus and whose entry into politics was likened to a resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. To reconcile Jesus's peaceful image with Hitler's message of hatred, the Bible was reportedly changed, omitting the Old Testament and portraying Jesus as a fighter against the Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Contortion of Hindu Religion** Similarly, when BJP members compare Modi to Lord Ram, the problem of Modi spreading hatred arises, as Lord Ram is characterized by "gentleness, kindness, and empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. To resolve this, "their people" have begun changing the iconography of Ram to an "angry Ram" and "angry Hanuman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. The article further criticizes the [[modi_governments_impact_on_indias_cultural_and_historical_perception | contortion of Hindu religion]] and scriptures to promote "hate-filled agenda," such as falsely inserting "Violence is the foremost duty" into Hindu scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **"Pappu" Narrative** To elevate Modi, his opponents, particularly Rahul Gandhi, are often portrayed as "incompetent fools" or "Pappu" by the BJP IT cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

## Hiding Poverty and Economic Disparities

Critics highlight instances where poverty was hidden instead of being addressed:
*   **"Namaste Trump" Wall** In 2020, a 1,600-foot-long wall was built in Gujarat to hide poverty and poor people during the "Namaste Trump" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **G20 Summit Slums** During the G20 summit in Delhi, slums were hidden behind green screens, restricting the movement of poor residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Rising Inequality** India's income inequality is reported to be the highest in 100 years, worse than during British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. While Modi's associates like Gautam Adani have become "richer beyond imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, 800 million poor people depend on 5 kg of free grains, with rampant unemployment and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The extension of the 5 kg free ration scheme for another five years is seen as a lack of vision for employment or poverty eradication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Media Omnipresence and Propaganda

Modi's image is consistently "plastered everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>, including in newspapers, radio, TV, social media, petrol pump hoardings, road posters, Google Ads, and government scheme advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

*   **Advertising Spending** The government spent over ₹64.91 billion on advertisements in eight years, including ₹7.1 million daily for print ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

*   **Questioning "Modi Magic"** The article suggests that the "Modi magic" is waning, evidenced by BJP's need to recruit politicians accused of corruption from other parties to win elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. People are increasingly asking why Modi can't stop violence in Manipur if he can stop foreign wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>, and why a record 225,000 people gave up Indian citizenship in 2022 if everything is "perfectly fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of protecting democracy and the Constitution from "hate and lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

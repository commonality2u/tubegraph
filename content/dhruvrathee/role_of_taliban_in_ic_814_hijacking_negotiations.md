The [[ic_814_hijacking_incident_timeline | IC 814]] flight, hijacked on December 24, 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, eventually landed at Kandahar International Airport in Afghanistan on December 26, 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. At this time, the Taliban was in power in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## Initial Involvement and Offers to Mediate

Upon the plane's arrival, Taliban authorities offered to mediate between the hijackers and [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Despite this, [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | India]] did not recognize the Taliban government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Consequently, [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | India]] sent an Indian High Commissioner from Islamabad to Kandahar to negotiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The plane and its passengers remained in Kandahar for six days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Taliban's Actions and India's Suspicions

During this period, the [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | Indian government]] harbored suspicions about the Taliban's true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The plane was surrounded by armed Taliban members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The Taliban claimed they took action against the hijackers to prevent reckless behavior and positioned their members around the plane for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. However, [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | Indian]] analysts believed this was done to prevent [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | India]] from conducting military operations against the hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

Taliban clearly stated that they would not allow [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | Indian]] forces to conduct rescue operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, but reiterated their offer to negotiate on behalf of [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Taliban's leader, Maulana Mohammad Umar, publicly stated to a [[india_pakistan_involvement_in_ic_814_hijacking | Pakistani]] newspaper that the hijackers should either leave the plane or lay down their weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

## Negotiation Process and Demand Reduction

The negotiations lasted for days, with the Taliban acting as an intermediary between the [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | Indian]] negotiators and the hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Ultimately, the hijackers' demands were significantly reduced from 36 prisoners to only 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. The credit for this reduction in demands is attributed to both the [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | Indian]] negotiators and the Taliban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

## Facilitating the Hijackers' Escape

On December 31, 1999, the demands of the hijackers were met, and three prisoners were released in Kandahar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. The hijackers then released the passengers of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

Despite [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | India]]'s expectation that the hijackers would be arrested by the Taliban, this did not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Instead, the Taliban's supreme leader and another Taliban member placed the hijackers and the released terrorists into a vehicle and drove them towards the [[india_pakistan_involvement_in_ic_814_hijacking | Pakistan]] border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. This action made [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | Pakistan]]'s involvement in the hijacking clear to [[indian_governments_handling_of_ic_814_hijacking | India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. The hijackers safely crossed the border into [[india_pakistan_involvement_in_ic_814_hijacking | Pakistan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

The incident's blame falls on the hijackers and their supporters, including the Taliban and [[india_pakistan_involvement_in_ic_814_hijacking | Pakistani]] forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

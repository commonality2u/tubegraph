The [[disappearance_of_malaysian_airlines_flight_mh370 | disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370]] on March 8, 2014, became the biggest aviation mystery in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37]</a>. The flight, carrying 227 passengers, 10 flight attendants, and 2 pilots, took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:42 AM, bound for Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03]</a>. After 20 minutes of normal flight, it crossed the Malaysian coastline and reached the South China Sea towards Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37]</a>. The last words from the cockpit were "Good night. MAS 370" at 01:16 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14]</a>. Approximately 30 seconds after entering Vietnamese airspace, the plane disappeared from radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14]</a>. This incident prompted extensive [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search operations and efforts to find MH370]] and the deployment of various technologies and methods to determine its fate.

## Initial Radar Tracking and Disappearance
At 01:21 AM, Flight MH370 disappeared from civilian radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17]</a>. [[Air Traffic Control and radar technology | Air Traffic Control]] in Kuala Lumpur initially believed the plane had flown out of their radar range and entered Vietnam's airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24]</a>. However, Vietnamese Air Traffic Control observed MH370 entering their airspace but then suddenly disappearing from their radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37]</a>. After 18 minutes of unsuccessful attempts to contact the plane, Vietnamese controllers informed Kuala Lumpur of its disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50]</a>. An emergency response only began four hours later, at 06:32 AM, the scheduled landing time in Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09]</a>.

## Military Radar Insights
Four days after the disappearance, on March 12, 2014, a new piece of information emerged: a military radar had spotted the plane that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54]</a>. According to this military radar, MH370 was last seen at 02:22 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09]</a>. Surprisingly, its location was not above the South China Sea, but near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, west of Malaysia, above the Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13]</a>. The radar indicated the plane was flying north towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, away from its intended destination of Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24]</a>.

## Satellite Data and the "7th Arc"
Further investigation utilized satellite data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41]</a>. It was discovered that the plane had attempted to automatically communicate with a satellite, a common practice for large aircraft like the Boeing 777 to facilitate communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44]</a>. While no location data was transmitted, the satellite merely acknowledged a login attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07]</a>.

Scientists and investigators used this limited data to approximate the plane's location. They reasoned that when the satellite received the communication, its antenna would have moved towards the plane's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26]</a>. By measuring the angle of the satellite's antenna, they estimated the plane's possible location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40]</a>.

The plane attempted to establish communication with the satellite seven times, resulting in "7 different circles in white colour" known as "Satellite Handshakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04]</a>. The last of these circles indicated the plane's final known communication point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20]</a>. This last circle was vast, covering areas from Kazakhstan, China, Indonesia to Australia, and a large portion of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32]</a>.

> [!INFO] The 7th Arc
> By performing additional calculations based on the plane's speed and remaining fuel, investigators estimated the plane could be within a specific shaded area on this last circle, famously called the "7th Arc" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50]</a>. This arc is located 2,000 km west of Australia and covers a vast, largely unexplored part of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08]</a>. The outermost yellow dotted circle on maps represented the plane's maximum travel range with its fuel, while the red curved arc was the 7th Arc, where the plane was assumed to have crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26]</a>.

The initial [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search operations]] in this area, both surface and deep ocean, became the largest and most expensive search operations ever conducted, costing $160 million over three years, but ultimately failed to find the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07]</a>.

## Debris Drift Analysis
In July 2015, the first piece of debris from the plane was found on the Island of RÃ©union, east of Madagascar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32]</a>. This discovery led to a "Drift Analysis" which looked at ocean currents to predict where various pieces of the plane might have flowed if it had crashed in the estimated area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34]</a>. According to this analysis, some pieces would have reached Madagascar and surrounding islands, which indeed matched where 27 pieces of the plane have been recovered to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47]</a>.

## WSPRnet Technology and Richard Godfrey's Breakthrough
In 2022, Richard Godfrey, a retired aerospace engineer, claimed to have uncovered the mystery using radio wave technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40]</a>. He combined data from the British Inmarsat Satellite, figures from Boeing, Australian oceanographers, and a new technology called WSPRnet (Weak Signal Propagation Reporter Network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02]</a>.

> [!INFO] WSPRnet Explained
> WSPRnet is a complex technology that essentially uses the reflections of weak radio waves to detect the path of airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22]</a>. Radio waves emitted from a source are reflected by the atmosphere, and if a plane flies through the path of these waves, it can be noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42]</a>. Godfrey developed a computer program capable of recognizing flight paths through these weak signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53]</a>.

According to Godfrey's calculations, MH370 lies precisely on the 7th Arc, approximately 4 km underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00]</a>. He noted that the area is challenging, with "many cliffs and underwater volcanoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14]</a>. While this area was searched in previous [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search operations and efforts to find MH370]], it's possible they missed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22]</a>. He claims to have pinpointed the exact location with an accuracy of 40 Nautical Miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41]</a>, proposing a new, much smaller search operation within this radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52]</a>.

While some criticize Godfrey's methodology as not accurate enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10]</a>, Godfrey believes a search initiated now could resolve the mystery by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22]</a>. The consistency of his analysis with the debris drift analysis offers hope for uncovering the mystery in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01]</a>.

The 1971 India-Pakistan War culminated in the birth of a new nation, Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This conflict was rooted in deep-seated political, economic, and cultural disparities, with language imposition being a significant catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Historical Context of Bengal
Before the British Raj, the Indian subcontinent comprised thousands of autonomous kingdoms with diverse languages, traditions, and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The Bengal region, encompassing present-day Bangladesh, West Bengal, and surrounding areas, was primarily ruled by Muslim monarchs from the 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These rulers often included local communities, fostering a strong co-existence and intermingling of Islam and Hinduism, which largely controlled extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## The Partition of India and Pakistan
The British Rule ended in 1947, leading to the devastating partition of India and Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The Lahore Resolution of 1940 had demanded a separate state for Muslims due to fears of being a minority in a unified India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This partition, drawn on religious lines, disregarded existing social, commercial, and cultural ties, breaking apart regions like Punjab and Bengal despite their shared cultures and languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Muslims in Bengal who favored Pakistan hoped for an improved standard of living and better financial and social conditions in a new Muslim country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The partition resulted in large-scale migration, riots, and mob violence, with an estimated death toll between 200,000 and 2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Many Muslim Biharis migrated to East Pakistan, later becoming controversial as "Anti-Bangladeshi" elements due to their pro-Pakistan stance and use of Urdu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Bengal itself was partitioned, with West Bengal joining India and East Bengal becoming part of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The new country of Pakistan was divided into two parts separated by 1,500 km of Indian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Interestingly, Bengalis constituted the majority ethnic group in the newly formed Pakistan, making up over half the population in East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. However, powerful positions in bureaucracy, military, and politics were concentrated in West Pakistan, primarily in the hands of Mohajirs and Punjabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Economic and Political Disparities
Pakistan began as a parliamentary democracy, but power became concentrated in the central government, hindering the establishment of a robust democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Political parties, especially those from East Bengal, were often sidelined, and the country saw multiple phases of military rule between 1947 and 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. East Pakistanis were denied political representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Economic disparity was stark: 75% of the national budget was spent on West Pakistan, despite East Pakistan generating 62% of the government's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. By 1969-70, West Pakistan's per capita income was 61% higher than East Pakistan's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Additionally, 25 times more military personnel were stationed in West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This contributed to the [[economic_and_political_disparities_between_east_and_west_pakistan | Economic and Political Disparities between East and West Pakistan]].

## The Language Movement and Cultural Identity
A major issue was the imposition of Urdu as the sole state language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Mohammad Ali Jinnah declared on March 21, 1948, that Urdu would be the state language of Pakistan, causing outrage in Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This triggered the Bengali Language Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. On February 21, 1952, Pakistani army open-fired on student protesters, killing five people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This day is now celebrated as Language Martyr's Day in Bangladesh and recognized as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

Despite Bangla being given official status in 1954 and becoming a state language in 1956, the movement solidified Bengali cultural and linguistic identity, pushing them further from West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This is a key aspect of the [[historical_context_of_language_and_economic_discrimination_in_bangladesh | historical_context_of_language_and_economic_discrimination_in_bangladesh]].

## Demand for Autonomy and the Liberation War
Following the 1965 India-Pakistan War, the economic and political imbalance between East and West Pakistan became more pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a leader of the Awami League, proposed a Six-Point Demand for East Pakistan's economic development and greater autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. These demands included turning Pakistan into a federation, giving East Pakistan control over its resources, separate currencies, independent foreign reserves, and even a separate military force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. West Pakistan's government rejected these as "separatist demands" and arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the Agartala Conspiracy Case, accusing him of collaborating with India to create an independent Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

Mujibur Rahman's arrest sparked widespread protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. General Ayub Khan resigned in 1969, appointing General Yahya Khan, who promised the first general elections in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### The 1970 Elections and Operation Searchlight
The 1970 elections saw the Awami League, an East Pakistani party, win 167 out of 313 seats, securing an outright majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Crucially, they won almost all seats in East Pakistan but none in West Pakistan, highlighting the deep divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. West Pakistan's political elite, particularly Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, refused to accept these results, leading General Yahya Khan to cancel them on March 1, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

This cancellation sparked an uproar in East Pakistan, with calls for freedom and autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Bengalis prioritized their ethnicity over Islam as a unifying factor, aiming for a secular, democratic, socialist state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, leading to the name "Bangladesh" (country of the Bengali people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

On March 7, 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman launched a Non-Cooperation Movement, delivering a historic speech declaring, "People in Bengal want freedom. People in Bengal want to live. People in Bengal want their fundamental rights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Tensions escalated, with attacks on pro-Pakistan Bihari communities, which the Pakistani army used as a pretext for intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Some pro-Pakistan Bengalis, notably from Jamat-e-Islami, collaborated with the Pakistani army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

The Bengali nationalists formed their independent army, the Mukti Bahini, which conducted guerrilla operations against the Pakistani army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. The Indian Army provided them with guerrilla warfare training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. In response, West Pakistan formed the Shanti Bahini, which committed extensive war crimes, including mass killings and violence against civilians, particularly targeting intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

On March 25, 1971, the West Pakistani government launched "Operation Searchlight," a genocide aimed at eliminating those demanding independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Thousands of Pakistani troops marched into Dhaka, arresting Sheikh Mujibur Rahman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Before his arrest, Mujibur Rahman declared East Pakistan an independent country, Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This declaration, transmitted via a transmitter, led to March 26 being celebrated as Bangladesh's Independence Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. On March 27, Major Ziaur Rahman publicly read this declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. During Operation Searchlight, over 7,000 students were murdered in Dhaka in one night, and more than 30,000 Bengalis were massacred within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

### India's Involvement and Bangladesh's Birth
The atrocities came to international light through journalist Anthony Mascarenhas's article in the Sunday Times on June 13, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This motivated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. By autumn 1971, over 10 million refugees had crossed into India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Economically, military intervention to save the people was considered more feasible than aiding the refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

On December 3, 1971, Pakistan launched Operation Chengiz Khan, bombing several Indian airfields, initiating the 1971 India-Pakistan War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Pakistan aimed to preempt India's military interference in Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. India responded with a defensive strategy in West Pakistan and a coordinated offensive in East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. The UN Security Council, with the Soviet Union's vetoes, failed to enforce an immediate cease-fire desired by the US, China, and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

On December 6, 1971, Bhutan first, then India, officially recognized Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. By December 12, Pakistan faced defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. On December 16, 1971, the Indian Army surrounded Dhaka, and Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi surrendered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. The Instrument of Surrender was signed, marking the largest surrender since World War II, with over 93,000 Pakistani troops surrendering to Indian and Bangladesh Liberation forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

This led to the [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | Bangladesh Liberation War and its Causes]].

## Post-Independence Developments
In 1972, the Simla Agreement was signed, where Pakistan recognized Bangladesh as an independent country in exchange for the release of 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war and the return of 13,000 km² of land occupied by Indian troops in West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. The United Nations recognized Bangladesh in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

After his release, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman returned to Dhaka as a hero and won the 1973 elections with a landslide majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. He banned political parties formed on the basis of religion, including Jamat-e-Islami, in an attempt to establish a secular democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. However, Mujibur Rahman and his family were assassinated on August 15, 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. General Ziaur Rahman seized power, revoking the ban on Jamat-e-Islami, leading to a period of military dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. His daughter, Sheikh Hasina, came to power in 2009 and is the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

The story of Bangladesh's independence highlights the critical role of language imposition and cultural differences. Had Urdu not been imposed and Bengalis treated equally, the nation might have remained unified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. However, the vast geographical and cultural differences between East and West Pakistan ultimately made unity difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

The [[aloha_airlines_flight_243_incident | Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident]] on April 28, 1988, served as a pivotal case in [[Investigation of airplane accidents | airplane accident investigation]], highlighting the critical importance of [[airplane_structural_fatigue_and_corrosion | airplane structural fatigue and corrosion]] and leading to significant [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | aviation safety improvements post1996]] and [[aviation_safety_procedures_and_regulations | aviation safety procedures and regulations]] worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

## The Aloha Airlines Flight 243 Incident

On April 28, 1988, at approximately 1:00 PM, [[aloha_airlines_flight_243_incident | Aloha Airlines Flight 243]], a routine 35-minute inter-island flight from Hilo to Honolulu, Hawaii, was preparing for takeoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The flight, operated by a local Hawaiian airline connecting various islands, was a Boeing 737 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Due to short distances, this particular aircraft had already completed eight flights and three round trips since morning, which was not unusual for such planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

At 1:25 PM, the flight took off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Twenty minutes into the flight, as it reached its cruising altitude of 24,000 feet, a loud bang occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This was followed by a sudden rapid decompression, causing chaos, objects flying, and difficulty breathing for passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Approximately 35 square meters of the plane's front body, including the roof and surrounding walls, disintegrated and blew away, exposing the sky above the passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Though oxygen masks deployed, the system was destroyed, leading to concerns about hypoxia among passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The cabin was also exposed to nearly 500 km/h winds and temperatures of -45Â°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Despite the devastation, Captain Robert Schornstheimer and First Officer Mimi Tompkins remained alive and in the cockpit, with their oxygen masks thankfully working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. They immediately initiated an emergency descent, dropping at 4,100 feet per minute while maintaining a speed of 500 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. They rerouted to Maui, a closer airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

Upon reaching 10,000 feet, a mountain, the Haleakala Summit, blocked their path to Maui airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The captain expertly slowed the plane to 170 knots and navigated it between two islands to bypass the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The pilots also faced a failing left engine during descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> and initial trouble deploying the nose landing gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. However, the nose gear eventually extended, avoiding a dangerous belly landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

At 1:58 PM, 13 minutes and 42 seconds after the explosion, [[aloha_airlines_flight_243_incident | Aloha Airlines Flight 243]] touched down safely at Maui airport, using brakes and the remaining engine's thrust reverser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Of the 95 people on board, 94 survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. One air hostess, C.B. Lansing, was tragically swept out of the plane and her body was never recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Many passengers, especially those in rows 4 to 7, sustained serious injuries like skull fractures and broken hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The fact that the seatbelt sign was still on, and most passengers were wearing seatbelts, was credited as the biggest reason for the high survival rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

## Investigation and Findings

Following the incident, the news spread globally, and the photos of the "miracle flight without a roof" were widely published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. America's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation to determine the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

The investigation revealed that the aircraft's fuselage, the main body of the plane, was severely weakened due to [[airplane_structural_fatigue_and_corrosion | fatigue and corrosion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The NTSB's final report identified three main reasons for the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

1.  **Airline's Maintenance Oversight:** Aloha Airlines' management failed to properly supervise their maintenance program, leading to inadequate assessment of inspections and quality controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. The airline falsely claimed to have used the Eddy Current technique, which uses electric current to detect even microscopic cracks, for inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
2.  **Regulatory Deficiency:** The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was partially blamed for not mandating a thorough inspection of fuselage joints when issuing Airworthiness Directives, despite Boeing's recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
3.  **Design and Ageing Aircraft Issues:** Both Boeing and the FAA were criticized for taking issues with the old bonding technique lightly when problems were discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The Boeing 737 involved was designed for a 20-year lifespan, with limits of 51,000 flight hours and 75,000 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Though its flight hours were below the limit, the plane's frequent short-distance flights meant its flight cycle count was nearly 90,000, significantly exceeding Boeing's recommended 75,000 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This high number of pressurization cycles contributed to the [[airplane_structural_fatigue_and_corrosion | fatigue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

### Technical Details of Failure

The Boeing 737 fuselage is constructed from aluminum sheet metal panels joined circumferentially in a frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. These panels overlap by three inches, forming "Lap Joints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Initially, Boeing used an epoxy glue bonding process and three rows of rivets on every overlap to absorb stress and prevent cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

However, problems arose with this method: high moisture content in the air caused the epoxy glue to degrade and the metal to corrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This shifted the stress burden primarily onto the rivets, leading to [[airplane_structural_fatigue_and_corrosion | fatigue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Boeing recognized this in 1972 and switched to a new "Hot Bonding" method, using heat and pressure to join sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. The Aloha Airlines aircraft, being an older model, still used the problematic cold bonding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

Boeing had issued a service bulletin in 1972 regarding this issue and an "Alert Service Bulletin" in 1987, one year before the incident, recommending proper inspection and repair of older planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Additionally, Boeing's safety design included "Tear Straps" every 25 cm to limit any fuselage tear to a 10x10 inch square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. However, Flight 243 had numerous cracks, rendering these straps ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. The NTSB concluded that at cruising altitude, the peak pressure caused these individual cracks to combine, leading to the entire roof section blowing apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

## Lasting Impact and Safety Improvements

The [[aloha_airlines_flight_243_incident | Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident]] led to significant [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | changes in aviation safety standards]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

*   **Mandatory Inspections:** All of Boeing's older aircraft underwent re-inspection, revealing many similar cracks, confirming the problem was widespread across the fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Stricter Regulations:** [[aviation_safety_procedures_and_regulations | Safety regulations]] were made stricter to prevent future occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   **Aging Aircraft Safety Program:** In 1991, the FAA launched its Aging Aircraft Safety Program, requiring all old aircraft to undergo mandatory inspections and control programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Advanced Inspection Techniques:** Aircraft maintenance techniques for detecting cracks were permanently changed. Methods like Eddy Current and ultrasonic testing, which do not rely on human eyesight, are now routinely used to detect cracks early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **High-Cycle Plane Rules:** New rules were established for high-cycle planes, like those on short-duration trips that complete many flights daily, requiring them to be inspected more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Aviation Safety Research Act:** The US government passed the Aviation Safety Research Act of 1988 to better understand and plan for the structural issues of aging aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

This incident, through its thorough investigation and subsequent reforms, fundamentally changed [[aviation_safety_procedures and regulations | aviation safety procedures and regulations]], preventing similar accidents from occurring since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

It is worth noting that while [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | aviation safety improvements post1996]] have been substantial due to incidents like this, other tragedies, such as the [[investigation_and_implications_of_the_titan_tragedy | Titan submersible disaster]] which explored the [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | Titanic disaster]] site, highlight the ongoing need for rigorous safety application in all modes of transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

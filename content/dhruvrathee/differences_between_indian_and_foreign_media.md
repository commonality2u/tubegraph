The media landscape in India differs significantly from that in many developed countries, particularly concerning its journalistic practices, focus, and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Journalistic Standards and Practices

### Fact-Checking and Verification
In India, statements are often approved by the media without proper verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. During demonetization, some Hindi newspapers printed opposing statements from Jaitley and Rahul Gandhi side-by-side, leaving it to the public to decide the truth, rather than the media finding and reporting the truth themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It is the media's responsibility to find the truth and question the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In contrast, foreign media, such as the Washington Post in America, meticulously track promises made by politicians. For example, the Washington Post reported that President Trump made 6,420 false promises over 649 days, averaging five lies daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. India's mainstream media, often associated with political parties, could maintain similar records but typically do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Focus and Priorities
Indian mainstream media often prioritizes vague or sensational news over significant policy matters. For instance, a vague statement by Rahul Gandhi might be highlighted more than a crucial financial bill legalizing corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, where donor names are not revealed under the guise of transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Foreign media, conversely, tends to discuss facts calmly and avoids unnecessary debates or religious issues, focusing instead on presenting factual information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. People abroad generally understand the responsibilities of the government, media, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### Professionalism and Public Perception
There is a "huge difference" in the demeanor and professionalism of media in developed countries compared to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Indian journalists' videos shown to people abroad have elicited laughter, with viewers questioning if they were watching a comedy show rather than journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Previously, around 2007, Indian media personalities commanded respect, but this has since declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. In America, journalists like Jim Acosta from CNN receive support from various organizations when they question the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## Challenges and External Influences

### [[Challenges of independent journalism in India|Outsourcing of Duties]]
The main media in India has "outsourced their duties and responsibility" to individuals like Dhruv Rathee and Pratik Sinha, who operate independently to expose fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, tasks that should be carried out by traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This means individuals now risk themselves to expose the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### [[Fake news in Indian media|Fake News and Misinformation]]
[[Fake news in Indian media|Fake news]] is a significant problem in India, with many political parties mastering techniques of faking news that mainstream media fails to expose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The "empire of lies" has altered the views of readers and viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. There is a proliferation of powerful politicians "surrounded by their untrue words," making it risky to expose them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Suppression and Censorship
When independent voices like Dhruv Rathee criticize Indian media, they receive no support and are instead suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Channels like "Peeing Human," which expose media hypocrisy, have faced copyright claims and attempts to shut them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Dhruv Rathee himself avoids sharing news channel clips due to copyright claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. The government's "troll army" also engages in online abuse as a form of censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Despite a law passed that critics cannot criticize the Prime Minister and the government, some news still gets printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Political and Historical Fixation
In India, there is a tendency to focus on history, especially after 2014, rather than current events. There's a demand for videos about past scams from a decade ago, ignoring present issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. For example, despite two years since demonetization, there was a persistent rumor about GPS in the 2000 Rupee currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Additionally, Hindi newspapers have not questioned the Prime Minister's inaccurate statements about historical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

## Global Context

### Press Freedom Index
India ranks 138th out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, whereas developed countries are typically in the top 20-30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Social Media and Polarization
While social media can be a valuable platform for education and conveying messages in a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, it also contributes to polarization. Opinions on social media can create "bubbles" where users are continuously shown content aligning with their existing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. In India, mainstream media contributes to this division, while abroad, social media plays a larger role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

[[causes_of_world_war_ii | World War II]] is noted as the most devastating war in human history, leaving numerous large cities in ruins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Its profound impact means that nearly all geopolitical events and international relations today can be traced back to this conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The war did not stem from a single event, but rather a series of events that collectively ignited the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Treaty of Versailles and its Aftermath
The story of [[causes_of_world_war_ii | World War II]] can be traced back to 1919, the year [[causes_of_world_war_i | World War I]] ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This year saw the signing of the Treaty of Versailles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, a peace treaty widely regarded as "the world's most hated treaty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. A key component of this treaty was Article 231, also known as the War Guilt Clause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This clause placed full responsibility for all losses incurred during [[causes_of_world_war_i | World War I]] solely on Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

France and Britain sought heavy reparations from Germany to recover their losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Consequently, Germany was mandated to pay an exorbitant fine of $33 billion to other countries, which translates to approximately $270 billion in present-day money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This colossal debt took nearly a century to settle, with Germany making its final payment in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The burden of these reparations crippled Germany's economy. The first payment in 1921 immediately led to hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The German Mark rapidly devalued; for instance, a packet of bread that cost 160 Marks in Berlin in 1922 soared to 200 billion Marks by 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This economic collapse resulted in a rapid rise in unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Adolf Hitler's Emergence and Rise to Power
Amidst this widespread distress, Adolf Hitler emerged as a young political leader skilled at manipulating the masses through his speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In 1923, Hitler's Nazi Party attempted a coup to overthrow the German government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Although the attempt failed, it significantly boosted Hitler's popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Propaganda was extensively used over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Rumours were spread that Germany's international humiliation was due to "anti-national" elements within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Hitler specifically blamed Jews and Socialists for Germany's disgrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The situation worsened with the Great Depression in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. By 1933, Germany faced 6 million unemployed people, widespread homelessness, and child starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Leveraging this despair, Hitler declared himself the Dictator of Germany in 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Hitler's Vision for a German Empire
Upon seizing full control, Hitler began pursuing his dream of a German Empire, or German Reich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This envisioned state would be racially pure, inhabited solely by people of the Aryan race, with no place for Jews and Slavs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. To foster hatred, the Judeo Bolshevism conspiracy theory was promoted, falsely claiming that Jews were behind the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the formation of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Hitler's ultimate goal was not just to conquer countries for pride but also to acquire resources to advance Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. He sought "Lebensraum" (living space) for his racially superior Aryan people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Rearmament and Early Violations of the Treaty
In 1935, the world discovered that Germany had developed an air force, a direct violation of the Treaty of Versailles, which prohibited Germany from having any military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Despite this, many in Britain viewed the Treaty's terms as unfair and excessively demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. In June 1935, Britain signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, formally recognizing Hitler's authority to establish a navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This growing militarisation, however, alarmed France, leading them to construct the 450 km long Maginot Line fortification on their Eastern border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Early Invasions and Appeasement
By 1938, with his military sufficiently prepared, Hitler turned his attention to Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. He aimed to unite all German-speaking countries under one nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. In February 1938, Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg was forced to sign an agreement allowing pro-Nazi individuals into the Austrian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. When the Chancellor proposed a national vote on Austria's independence, Hitler marched his army into Austria in March 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The Chancellor resigned to avoid bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Hitler's propaganda ministry spread false news of riots by communists, justifying German military intervention requested by the Austrian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The next day, the Austrian Parliament was dissolved, and Austria ceased to be an independent country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This invasion succeeded without bloodshed largely due to widespread support for Hitler among propaganda-influenced Austrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Following Austria, Hitler targeted Czechoslovakia, specifically the Sudetenland region, where approximately 3 million Germans lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. He used this as a pretext to claim the region for Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, seeking to avoid war, believed that appeasing Hitler would maintain peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This led to the Munich Agreement in September 1938, which ceded Sudetenland to Germany under Hitler's promise of no further wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. However, Hitler violated this agreement less than a year later, invading the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The German army easily won, splitting the country into German territory and a Nazi client state known as the Slovak Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This drew heavy criticism for Chamberlain.

## The Invasion of Poland and the Start of War
Hitler then set his sights on Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. To facilitate this, he signed a Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union in 1939, aligning their interests as the Soviets also desired a part of Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. On September 1, 1939, nearly 1 million German troops invaded Poland from the North and South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

This act shocked other countries. The UK and France, at their breaking point, issued an ultimatum to Hitler: withdraw from Poland or face war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Hitler ignored it, leading the UK, followed by France, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada, to declare war on Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

This period was initially known as the Phony War as no real military action occurred despite the declarations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. None of the declaring countries provided military support to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Poland's old-fashioned army, still using horses, was quickly defeated by the German military within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. By September 8, 1939, German troops occupied Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### [[blitzkrieg_military_strategy | Blitzkrieg]] Military Strategy
A key factor in Germany's rapid successes was Hitler's revolutionary warfare strategy known as [[blitzkrieg_military_strategy | Blitzkrieg]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This strategy focused on speed and stealth, using tanks for rapid invasion and air force (Luftwaffe) support to quickly overwhelm opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. "Blitz" means lightning in German, reflecting the lightning speed of these invasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

To sustain this intense pace, German soldiers were reportedly given drugs like Pervitin (now known as Crystal Meth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This drug eliminated fatigue, suppressed hunger and thirst, reduced pain, and boosted confidence, allowing soldiers to fight day and night, concluding wars within days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Continued Expansion
After Poland's defeat, it was partitioned, with half going to Nazi Germany and the other half to the Soviets, who claimed it as former Russian Empire territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The Soviets then turned their attention to Finland, another former Russian Empire territory, fearing a German invasion that would bring them too close to Leningrad, where Stalin resided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. When Finland refused to hand over territory, the Soviets launched a military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Despite the Soviet army's size and superior equipment, the war lasted over two months, concluding in March 1940 with the Moscow Peace Treaty, ceding 11% of Finland's land to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Meanwhile, Hitler's focus was on Norway and Denmark. In April 1940, using his [[blitzkrieg_military_strategy | Blitzkrieg]] strategy, he invaded both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The invasions were swift, and Norway's government fled to London to establish a Government in Exile, while Hitler set up a pro-Nazi puppet government in Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigned on May 10, 1940, acknowledging his failure to protect neighbouring countries from Nazi invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Winston Churchill famously assumed the role of Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

### Battle of France and Dunkirk
On the same day, May 10, 1940, Hitler launched an all-out attack on France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. This "Battle of France" involved over 1,000 fighter bomber airplanes and around 3 million German soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The German troops were divided into three groups:
-   **Group B** attacked the Netherlands and entered Belgium to engage Allied forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
-   **Group C** launched a distracting attack on the Maginot Line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
-   **Group A**, the "master plan," secretly invaded France through the Ardennes Forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. French military experts considered this vast forest an impenetrable fortress, not expecting an invasion from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Over 40,000 military vehicles were used by Group A for this advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

On May 15, 1940, Group A captured Sedan and moved northward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. British forces fighting Group B in Belgium were suddenly attacked from behind, finding themselves surrounded by the Nazi army on three sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Their only escape route was via the sea near the port of Dunkirk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

This led to the historic Dunkirk evacuation, where nearly 400,000 Allied troops (British and French) were stranded on the beaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Winston Churchill initiated Operation Dynamo on May 26, 1940, the largest evacuation in military history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. Despite German ground fire and air attacks, the British Royal Air Force provided cover for evacuating ships, and private fishing boats and civilians from the English Channel joined the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. By June 4, 1940, approximately 350,000 soldiers were successfully evacuated, though most Allied military equipment was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

Days later, on June 22, 1940, France surrendered to Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Italy, under Dictator Mussolini, formed an alliance with Hitler, known as the Pact of Steel, and declared war on France and Britain on June 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. By July 1940, Hitler had seized control of numerous neighbouring countries, including Austria, Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

At this point, the main belligerents were Hitler's Germany, Britain, and the Soviet Union, with Germany and the Soviet Union maintaining a non-aggression pact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. America remained uninvolved, reluctant to interfere in Europe's situation after [[causes_of_world_war_i | World War I]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. With Hitler holding a significant advantage, the question remained how the situation would turn in Britain's favor.

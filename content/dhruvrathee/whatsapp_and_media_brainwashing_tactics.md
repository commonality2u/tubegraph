A significant "mafia" operates in India through [[the_influence_of_whatsapp_in_political_brainwashing | WhatsApp]] and the media, aiming to [[election_strategies_and_brainwashing_tactics | brainwash]] Hindus and turn them into "puppets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This alleged mafia has four departments, two of which involve instilling pride and a sense of victimhood, while the other two focus on fear and presenting a "messiah" figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Departments of the Brainwashing Mafia

### 1. Instilling Pride and Arrogance
This department tells individuals they are "great" simply by being Hindu, especially focusing on so-called upper-caste Hindus, regardless of personal achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. It promotes the idea that being born Hindu makes one "very fortunate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### 2. Portraying as a Victim
The second department focuses on convincing people that they have been "tortured for centuries" and are "pitiful victims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### 3. Instilling Fear and Identifying a Threat
This department asserts that Hindus are "in danger" and identifies specific groups as threats who could "attack at any time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

#### Historical Parallels in Spreading Fear
Historically, dictators have targeted the majority community to spread fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Pakistan:** In Pakistan, to [[election_strategies_and_brainwashing_tactics | brainwash]] the Sunni Muslim majority, [[whatsapp_misinformation_and_its_impact_on_society | fake news]] is spread about minorities like Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Shia Muslims, Ahmadiyya Muslims, and Sufi Muslims posing a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Pakistani school books contain [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | hateful propaganda]], telling children stories of how Hindus and Sikhs "killed millions of women and children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. The result of this hatred is a country facing severe poverty (40% below poverty line), unemployment, and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **America (1919):** News was manipulated in Washington D.C. to incite racial riots. An attack by a black criminal on a black woman was suppressed, while the same criminal's attack on a white woman became front-page news, leading to riots, deaths, and injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The Washington Post apologized for its racial past 100 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

#### Modern Tactics in India
Similar tactics are employed in India today to instil fear within the majority Hindu community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

##### Manipulating Crime Narratives
The [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | pro-government media]] and [[the_influence_of_whatsapp_in_political_brainwashing | WhatsApp mafia]] selectively highlight crimes to spread hatred.
*   **Shraddha Walker Case:** The brutal murder of Shraddha Walker by her Muslim boyfriend, Aftab Ameen Poonawalla, was used by pro-government media to spread hatred against all Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Channels like News18 and Times Now Nav Bharat were fined for spreading this hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Social media influencers and news outlets used the name "Abdul" to generalize that "every Muslim man is a potential murderer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Selective Reporting:** Similar cases involving Hindu perpetrators with similar gruesome details (e.g., Anjan Das killed by his wife Poonam, Sahil Gahlot killing Nikki Yadav and storing her body in a fridge) are often ignored by the media because they lack a "Hindu-Muslim angle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. Crimes where Hindu men kill Muslim women (e.g., Aman Kumar Singh killing Sonam Parveen, Anshu killing Naima, Satish Kumar Rai burning Gulnaz Khatoon alive, Praveen Arun killing Aynaz and her family) are also suppressed or reported without naming the Hindu accused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.
*   **Generalization vs. Reality:** It is illogical to generalize 550-600 million Hindu men or millions of Muslim men as potential murderers based on a few dozen cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. According to the NCRB report Crime in India 2022, there were 8,125 female murder victims, which naturally includes permutations of different religious backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.
*   **Selective Outrage:** [[Role of media in spreading mass hysteria | Brainwashed individuals]] only speak up when a Muslim man is the murderer and the victim is a Hindu woman, remaining silent in other cases of violence against women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. True justice would demand prevention of all crimes against women and swift punishment for all culprits, regardless of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] BJP's Stance on Justice
> Politicians and workers associated with the ruling party are unwilling to demand justice for all victims equally, especially if a Hindu woman is killed by a Hindu man in a BJP-ruled state or if the culprit has a BJP connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. Examples include support rallies for convicted former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh, accusations against BJP IT cell members in the IIT-BHU case, and the delayed FIR and journalist arrest in the Ankita Bhandari case involving a BJP politician's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.

##### Spreading Stereotypes
The Prime Minister has been accused of spreading lies and stereotypes in speeches, such as claiming "those who have more children" (referring to Muslims) will receive wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>. This is despite the Congress manifesto not mentioning "wealth redistribution" or specific religious groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. The perception that Muslims have more children is labeled "utter nonsense" and is linked to female literacy rates, with data showing a decreasing birth rate among Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.

##### Fabricating Stories and Identities
When real news isn't available to create fear, [[fake_news_in_indian_media | fake news]] is spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.
*   **Fake Identities:** Individuals pretending to be Muslim to justify crimes (e.g., Vikas Kumar pretending to be Rashid Khan in the Shraddha Walker case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>) or to spread hateful messages online (e.g., Pawan Sharma hiding behind the username Rajiya Bano to post anti-Hindu content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.
*   **False Flag Operations:** Members of organizations like Bajrang Dal and Hindu Mahasabha have been caught slaughtering cows to frame Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This is described as a "strategic move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Misrepresenting Videos:** A video of girls beating a man (Kapil Chauhan, harassing girls) was circulated with the false claim that Hindu girls were "teaching a lesson to love jihadis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting Critics:**
    *   **Rashid Alvi:** A Congress leader's statement about "demons chanting Jai Shri Ram" was intentionally clipped to falsely portray him as anti-Hindu and to show Congress as pro-Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>. The full context shows he was referring to disguised demons in the Ramayan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Ravish Kumar:** Accusations that he tried to protect a Muslim riot accused by calling him a Brahmin, or that he never talks about Kashmiri Pandits or criticizes Congress, are proven false by examining his unedited reports and past work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Dhruv Rathee (Self-reference):** The creator of the video himself has been targeted by [[paid_social_media_trends_and_fake_pr | WhatsApp messages]] falsely claiming his real name is "Badru Rashid" and that his wife is Pakistani, attempting to project him as Muslim or Pakistani to discredit his criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>. This is part of the strategy to show that anyone criticizing the ruling party is not a Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>.

### 4. Presenting Narendra Modi as a Messiah
This department promotes the idea that Narendra Modi is the "only one" who can save Hindus from perceived threats, encouraging votes solely for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. He is portrayed as the "best Prime Minister in the world," "greatest," and "God's blessing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Impact on Democracy
The culmination of these tactics leads to a situation where the ability to think and understand is suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. This manipulation undermines democratic processes, as seen in incidents like the BJP winning seats unchallenged in Surat and Arunachal Pradesh, or obstructing MCD elections in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>. Such actions could lead to a future of "One Nation Zero Election" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>.

## Call to Action
To counter this brainwashing, it is crucial to spread awareness among people, particularly Hindus, as they are the primary targets of this manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>. The struggle is to protect the Constitution and democracy of the country, urging people to vote and speak up against such tactics before it's too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.

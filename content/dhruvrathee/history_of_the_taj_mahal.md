The Taj Mahal is renowned as the 7th Wonder of the World and a global symbol of love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Despite its fame, it has been the subject of numerous claims and [[controversies_about_taj_mahal_being_a_hindu_temple | controversies]] over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. These include theories about Hindu idols or other fabled treasures hidden behind its 22 closed doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, allegations that it is actually a Shiv Temple named Tejo Mahalaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> built by Raja Paramardi Dev in the 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, and [[myths_about_shah_jahan_and_taj_mahal_workers | myths]] that its builder, Shah Jahan, chopped off the hands of 20,000 laborers after its construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Love Story: Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal

The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan, the fifth [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal emperor]], as a mausoleum for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

*   **Shah Jahan**
    *   Born: January 5, 1592 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   Real Name: Khurram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Royal Name: Shah Jahan, meaning 'the King of the World', bestowed upon him later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   Parents: Jahangir (father) and Jagat Gosain (mother), who was the chief queen of Jahangir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Mumtaz Mahal**
    *   Born: 1593 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Real Name: Arjumand Banu Begum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   Royal Name: Mumtaz Mahal, bestowed after her wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Khurram (Shah Jahan) and Arjumand (Mumtaz) were engaged in 1607 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> and married in 1612 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Shah Jahan had other wives, including Qandahari Mahal and Akbarabadi Mahal, but these were primarily for political alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. His affection for Mumtaz was significantly greater, granting her special favors such as the title of Malika-i-Jahan (Queen of the World) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Her palace, Khas Mahal, was reportedly decorated with pure gold and precious stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Mumtaz showed interest in administration, often accompanying Shah Jahan on diplomatic negotiations and wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. While he had only one child with his other wives, he had 14 children with Mumtaz Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Mumtaz Mahal tragically died on June 17, 1631, while giving birth to their 14th child, likely from postpartum hemorrhage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Shah Jahan was overcome with grief, isolating himself for a year in mourning, after which his hair is said to have turned white and his demeanor showed deep despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Believing the grave to be the final resting place of a soul in Islamic theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, Shah Jahan resolved to build a grand and unparalleled final resting place for Mumtaz Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Construction of the Taj Mahal

The construction of the Taj Mahal began after Mumtaz Mahal's death.
*   **Chief Architect:** Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who was bestowed the title 'Nadir-e-Asr' (The Wonder of the Age) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Calligraphy:** Done by Abdul Haq Shirazi on the white marble panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Materials Transport:** Over 1,000 elephants were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Origin of Materials:**
    *   White marble: Rajasthan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   Jasper: Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
    *   Jade and Crystal: China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
    *   Turquoise: Tibet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>
    *   Sapphire: Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
    *   Carnelian: Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
    *   Gems and materials came from all over the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Duration and Labor:** It took 22 years to build and decorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, with approximately 22,000 laborers working daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## [[debate_over_22_closed_doors_of_the_taj_mahal | Controversies and the 22 Closed Doors]]

Recent [[controversies about Taj Mahal being a Hindu Temple |controversies]] have focused on the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Petition for Opening the Doors
In 2022, BJP politician Rajneesh Singh filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court, demanding that the 22 closed rooms of the Taj Mahal be opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He requested the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) to form a special committee to investigate if Hindu idols were present inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The petition argued that claims of the Taj Mahal being a Hindu Temple called Tejo Mahalaya necessitated the opening of these doors under Freedom of Information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that it mocked the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The court emphasized that historical research is the domain of historians following proper methodology, not courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### ASI Clarifications
Sources from the ASI have explained that these "22 rooms" are not individual rooms but a long corridor with doors along its sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. These doors have not always been locked; ASI staff regularly clean the corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. A retired ASI official confirmed that the walls are bare and that such underground rooms are common in [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal monuments]] like Humayun's Tomb and Safdarjung Tomb, serving as structural elements for the monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The area was cordoned off because there was nothing for tourists to see, and keeping them open unnecessarily would lead to overcrowding, wear and tear, and potential damage to the monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The Taj Mahal, a protected World Heritage Site with over 100,000 daily visitors, requires such measures for its preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. To further quell debates, the ASI publicly released photos of the closed rooms in 2022, showing ongoing restoration work and their interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. These pictures are available on the ASI website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## [[controversies_about_taj_mahal_being_a_hindu_temple | Claims of Taj Mahal as a Hindu Temple (Tejo Mahalaya)]]

The claim that the Taj Mahal is a Shiv Temple called Tejo Mahalaya has been a recurring one.
*   **2015 Petition:** In April 2015, six lawyers filed a similar suit in the Agra court, claiming the Taj Mahal was a Shiv Temple and seeking permission for Hindus to worship there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. They asserted that Raja Paramardi Dev built Tejo Mahalaya in 1212 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, which was later inherited by Raja Maan Singh in the 17th century and then held by Raja Jai Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. According to their plea, Shah Jahan annexed it in 1632 and converted it into a memorial for Mumtaz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Government and ASI Response:** The court directed the Central Government, Union Ministry of Culture, Home Secretary, and the ASI to reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. In November 2015, Union Cultural Minister Mahesh Sharma stated that the government found no evidence that the Taj Mahal was a Hindu Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. In 2017, the ASI reiterated that the Taj Mahal is a tomb, not a temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### The Land Transaction
The claim that Shah Jahan forcefully took Raja Jai Singh's palace is historically inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Historical records, compiled by W. E. Begley and Z. A. Desai in *Taj Mahal: The Illumined Tomb*, detail the construction and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

Raja Jai Singh, grandson of Raja Maan Singh (Akbar's trusted general and Harka Bai's nephew) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, had friendly relations with Shah Jahan, who was Akbar's grandson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Raja Jai Singh resided in the area where the Taj Mahal was built, in what was referred to as a 'Haveli', 'Khana', or 'Manzil' (meaning home) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. He offered to donate his land freely for the tomb out of close relations between the Jaipur royals and the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, Shah Jahan did not accept the donation and instead gave Raja Jai Singh four palaces in exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This transaction was officially recorded on December 28, 1633, and the record can be seen in Jaipur's City Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## [[influence_of_pn_oak_on_taj_mahal_conspiracy_theories | The Origin of the Lies: P.N. Oak]]

The primary source of the Tejo Mahalaya claim is Purushottam Nagesh Oak (P.N. Oak) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Not a Historian:** Oak was a history enthusiast, not a trained historian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. He rewrote history based on speculative etymological similarities, such as claiming the Vatican was once a Hindu temple because "Vatican" sounds like "Vatika" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. He also claimed Westminster Abbey was a Hindu temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **Religious Claims:** Oak asserted that Christianity was "Chrisn-Nity" (ideology of Krishna), believing Jesus Christ visited India and learned Krishna's ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. He also claimed Islam and Judaism originated from Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, linking Abraham to Brahma and Sarah to Saraswati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Taj Mahal Theory Evolution:** Oak initially claimed the Taj Mahal was an ancient Hindu wonder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. After historians refuted this, he revised his claim to state it was built in 1155 by Raja Paramardi Dev or his Chief Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Legal Challenges:** In 2000, Oak filed a PIL based on his 1989 pamphlet *Taj Mahal: The True Story* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. He selectively used historical facts (e.g., Shah Jahan acquiring Raja Jai Singh's palace) and combined them with fabricated imaginative narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The Supreme Court dismissed his petition as a "misconceived notion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

Oak's fictional tales gained wider circulation with the rise of WhatsApp in 2010, transforming into "theories of the WhatsApp University" and leading to fresh, baseless petitions in courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## [[myths_about_shah_jahan_and_taj_mahal_workers | Myth about Shah Jahan Chopping Workers' Hands]]

Another widespread [[myths_about_shah_jahan_and_taj_mahal_workers | myth]] claims that Shah Jahan chopped off the hands of the 20,000 workers after the Taj Mahal's completion to prevent them from building another equally beautiful monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This claim was even repeated by Union Agricultural Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### Logical Inconsistencies and Counter-Evidence
*   **Logistics:** It is illogical to imagine 20,000 workers patiently waiting in a queue for their hands to be chopped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Evidence:** There is no historical or archaeological evidence to support this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. No skeletal remains of severed hands have been found, nor is it mentioned in any historical books, court historian accounts, or records by contemporary foreign travelers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   **Continued Employment:** Contrary evidence suggests Shah Jahan established a large settlement called Taj Ganj for thousands of masons, artisans, and workers, which still exists today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The descendants of these workers continue to live and practice their forefathers' skills there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Projects:** After the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan's workers built an entirely new city, Shahjahanabad (later Delhi), including iconic structures like the Red Fort and Jama Masjid, all around the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This would have been impossible if the workforce had been mutilated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. Shah Jahan's period is known as the Golden Period of [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal Architecture]] precisely because of his respect for his workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Legacy and Significance

Today, the Taj Mahal stands as an undisputed architectural marvel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. It is one of the official Seven Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. As one of India's most popular tourist attractions, it draws visitors from around the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The Taj Mahal remains a source of national pride, an Indian gem in every aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

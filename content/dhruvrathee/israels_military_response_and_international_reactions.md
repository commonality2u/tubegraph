## Israel's Military Response
Following the [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | surprise attack by Hamas]] on October 7, Israel declared a state of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This surprise attack, which saw thousands of rockets fired and a multi-pronged infiltration by ground, sea, and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, was the biggest in decades for the [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel-Palestine conflict]] and evoked memories of the Yom Kippur War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

Israel's immediate response included:
*   **Airstrikes in Gaza** The Israeli military carried out airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in thousands of Palestinian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Operation Iron Swords** Israel launched its own counter-attack, named Operation Iron Swords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Deployment of Forces** The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) deployed their Navy, Air Force, and Ground Forces, alongside drone strikes in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Electricity Cut** Israel's Energy Minister ordered the cessation of electricity supply to Gaza, much of which was previously supplied by Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   **Statements from Leadership** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, "Citizens of Israel, we are at war," vowing that the enemy would pay an "unprecedented price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. The defense minister asserted that Hamas had made a significant mistake and that Israel would win the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

Israel has attempted to demonstrate responsible counter-offensive measures, such as issuing warnings before airstrikes on buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. Examples include a 10-minute warning before striking a 14-storey building in Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>, a warning to Fatima Bashir's family in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>, and a 15-minute warning to Gazans in August 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Despite these claims, many Palestinian civilians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

### [[controversies_and_failures_of_israeli_intelligence | Intelligence Failures]]
A significant point of discussion regarding the conflict is the apparent failure of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, to intercept the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Mossad is widely considered one of the world's most powerful intelligence agencies, with informants within Palestinian military groups and a history of precise assassinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Questions have been raised as to how they missed the stockpiling of thousands of rockets in Gaza or the failure of the Gaza-Israel border's "smart barriers" (cameras, ground motion sensors, army patrols) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

The Israeli government has faced domestic criticism for this failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. A former head of the Israeli Navy described it as a "huge failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, and a major investigation into the intelligence failure has reportedly begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. Allegedly, Egyptian intelligence officials had repeatedly warned Israel of an impending major event, but these warnings were ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

## [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | International Reactions]]
The [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | international reactions]] to the conflict have varied:

*   **United States** President Joe Biden condemned the attack and expressed "rock-solid and unwavering support" for Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **European Union** The EU's foreign policy chief strongly condemned the attack, affirming Israel's right to defend itself under international law and calling for the immediate release of Israeli hostages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   **Iran** Iran, a key supporter of Hamas, stated through its foreign ministry that Hamas's attack was an act of self-defense by the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   **Egypt** Egypt's foreign ministry has been engaging with Saudi Arabia and Jordan in an effort to de-escalate the Israeli-Palestinian tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
*   **Palestine** Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, representing the Fatah party that governs the West Bank, asserted that Palestinians have the right to protect themselves against "the terror of the settlers and foreign troops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **India** India has historically supported the Palestinian cause of self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. However, Prime Minister Modi expressed shock at the "terrorist attacks" and showed solidarity with Israel and its innocent victims, labeling Hamas's actions as terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

Many international observers condemn the actions of Hamas as terrorism, particularly due to disturbing reports of their treatment of civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. While acknowledging the injustice faced by common Palestinians, the killing of Israeli civilians is deemed unjustifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. The prevailing sentiment advocates for Israel, as a powerful democratic country, to use its powers responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>, and discourages war-mongering from afar, emphasizing the human cost for ordinary Israeli and Palestinian families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.

To build a prosperous nation, addressing fundamental issues like safety and security is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This includes ensuring the well-being of citizens, which extends to their mental health and access to quality education.

## Improving Mental Health Services

A key priority for national well-being involves addressing the mental health of armed forces personnel and extending support to other public service sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Addressing Suicide Rates in Armed Forces
From 2017 to 2022, 819 personnel in the Indian armed forces died from suicide, as reported by the Minister of State for Defence, Ajay Bhatt, in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. A goal is to reduce this number to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Proposed Solutions
The strategy to improve mental health includes:
*   **Hiring Mental Health Practitioners** The proposal is to hire 1,800 mental health practitioners to support the approximately 1.2 million active personnel in the Indian Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
    *   This ratio is based on the US Army's approach of one behavioral specialist for every 700 soldiers, acknowledging the intensive military setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
    *   These practitioners would include clinical psychiatrists, behavioral health specialists, and licensed clinical social workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Job Creation** This initiative would create 1,800 new government jobs in the mental health sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Expansion of Services** Following a successful trial, the scheme would be extended to paramilitary forces, intelligence agencies, and all police officers nationwide, creating more jobs for mental health practitioners and doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

## Investing in [[educational_infrastructure_and_opportunities | Educational Infrastructure and Opportunities]]
Significant investment in [[educational_infrastructure_and_opportunities | educational infrastructure]] is necessary to ensure the supply of qualified professionals, including mental health practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

### Increased Education Budget
One of the first steps would be to increase the education budget by three to four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### Funding Sources
Funding for this increased budget could come from:
*   **Corporate Tax Increase** Reverting corporate tax rates to 2017-18 levels could generate an additional ₹1 trillion for the government, as taxes have been reduced in recent years, resulting in significant government losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   **Budget Reallocation** Funds could be reallocated from areas like highway construction, where nearly ₹2 trillion is spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Considering that only 8% of Indian families own cars, while 50% use cycles, bikes, or scooters, reallocating these funds to education would benefit a larger segment of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Ending [[corruption_and_governance_reforms | Corruption]]** Eliminating [[corruption_and_governance_reforms | corruption]] at all levels would free up substantial resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. The primary reasons for [[corruption_and_governance_reforms | corruption]] are identified as a top-down approach (superiors demanding bribes), overworked and underpaid government employees, and greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Addressing the first two reasons through increased salaries, better mental healthcare, and sufficient staffing (e.g., doubling police personnel and increasing judges) would significantly curb corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### Gender Sensitization in Education
To address mindsets contributing to crimes like sexual harassment, gender sensitization classes would be introduced in schools. This aims to teach children the right mindset from an early age, fostering a more respectful society as they grow up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

The implementation of such solutions, as demonstrated by countries like [[singapores_education_and_vocational_training_systems | Singapore]], which rose from poverty and ethnic clashes in the 1960s to become fifth on the Global Peace Index 2024, proves their practicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

The 2005 Hollywood film *The Exorcism of Emily Rose* was based on the true story of Anneliese Michel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, one of the most famous exorcism incidents globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Case of Anneliese Michel

Anneliese Michel was born in 1952 in West Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. At 16, she fainted in school, entering a strange trance-like state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Later, she reported a heavy weight on her body and woke up having wet the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. A year later, similar incidents prompted her parents to seek medical attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Doctors and neurologists found nothing wrong with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

In February 1970, Anneliese contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. While there, she claimed to see strange colors and hear voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Doctors diagnosed her with temporal lobe epilepsy, a condition affecting over 50 million people worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, her case was considered unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Her hallucinations escalated, with voices constantly telling her she was cursed, leading to depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. She began kneeling for prayer approximately 600 times a day, damaging her knee ligaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Other bizarre behaviors included hiding under a table and barking like a dog for two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, and eating spiders, coal, and a bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Exorcism and Demonic Claims

Unable to find medical answers, her parents approached a bishop for an exorcism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Exorcism is defined as the religious procedure to remove an evil spirit from a body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. It was claimed that six demons resided within Anneliese: German dictator Adolf Hitler, Roman Emperor Nero, Judas (the disciple who betrayed Jesus), Cain (son of Adam who killed his brother Abel), Lucifer (the main demon in Christian theology), and Valentin Fleischmann (a German Catholic priest from the 1500s expelled for alcoholism and murder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. During the exorcism, the alleged demons reportedly spoke, and real audio clips of the exorcism are available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Scientific Perspective on "Demonic Possession"

The phenomenon often referred to as "demonic possession" or a "ghost taking control of your body" is scientifically attributed to Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)

DID involves the existence of multiple distinct personalities within one individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This condition involves the "dissociation of identity," where a person's true self diverges from their perceived self (self-image) and their desired self (ideal self) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This concept is explored in psychology through the Dunning-Kruger effect, where individuals overestimate their abilities despite a lack of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

In DID, these multiple identities become "Alters," which can number two, four, five, or even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. A notable case is Kim Nobel, who reportedly has over 100 different personalities, each with distinct names, ages, genders, temperaments, body language, and memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. While normal individuals may exhibit different personalities in different social contexts (e.g., with friends versus parents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, DID is an extreme manifestation where even name, age, and memories change during a "switch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

The primary personality is called the Host Identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. A challenging aspect of DID is the memory loss that occurs when personalities switch, leading to forgotten keys, ordered pizzas, or even finding one's car mysteriously miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Patients often do not know they suffer from DID, only experiencing frequent memory lapses or a distorted sense of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The solution to DID is "Reintegration," where communication is established between different alters to unite identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Understanding triggers that cause personality changes helps manage the DID system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Anneliese Michel's Death and Medical Explanation

Anneliese Michel suffered 67 exorcisms over 10 months before she passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Her death was not due to demons but to starvation and acute dehydration, leaving her weighing only 32 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

The investigation revealed that Anneliese had been under psychiatric care since age 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Physicians treating her reported positive responses to medication and therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. They identified three mental illnesses she suffered from:
1.  **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>
2.  **Anorexia Nervosa**: A condition where individuals have distorted perceptions of their weight, leading to extreme undereating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
3.  **Hyper-Religious Personality Disorder**: Characterized by intense religious beliefs, mystical experiences, and delusions about spirituality, often leading to obsession with "unholy" things and worries about sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Her extremely religious upbringing is believed to have contributed to her belief in demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The "demons" she named—Hitler, Judas, Lucifer—were figures taught in her childhood, reinforcing the idea that her cultural and religious background influenced her delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. A professor at Wuertzburg University stated that these factors combined resulted in a severe psychic disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

The District Attorney concluded that her death was preventable with timely medical assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Her parents and two Roman Catholic priests involved in the exorcism were charged and convicted of negligent homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

## Root Cause of Dissociative Identity Disorder

Research in the US, Canada, and Europe found that approximately 90% of DID cases are linked to some form of childhood abuse, whether physical, emotional, or sexual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This trauma causes the brain to dissociate as a coping mechanism, splitting into different personalities to manage the mental wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. While a coping mechanism, DID is a serious mental illness that can lead to stress, anxiety, severe depression, addiction, and in some cases, self-harm or violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

Often, victims of childhood trauma do not remember the events as they are pushed into the unconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Psychotherapy aims to help patients recall and accept the traumatic event, which is crucial for reintegrating scattered identities into a single self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

## Spectrum of Dissociation

Dissociation exists on a spectrum, with DID being an extreme manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. Mild dissociative episodes are common; some studies suggest that 50-74% of people experience at least one such episode in their lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

Examples of mild dissociation include:
*   **Dissociative Amnesia**: Forgetting details about a traumatic episode as the mind dissociates it from time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
*   **Dissociative Fugue**: A state where individuals are confused about their past and identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. An example is Michael Boatwright, an American man who started speaking Swedish after fainting, later revealed to have lived extensively in Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Depersonalisation**: Feeling detached from one's own actions, thoughts, or feelings, as if observing oneself from outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.
*   **Derealisation**: The feeling that the world and people around are unreal, like a dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## [[media_portrayal_of_mental_illnesses | Media Portrayal of Mental Illnesses]]

Unfortunately, many films portray these serious mental health issues in a scary or insensitive way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Movies like *Bhool Bhulaiya* use mental illness for comic relief, showing unapproved and strange treatment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. Others, like *Aparichit* or Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho*, [[criticism_of_sensationalist_paranormal_media | sensationalize DID patients as violent and dangerous]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Dr. Simone Reinders of King's College London notes that such portrayals exacerbate the existing stigma around these illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. In reality, most DID patients are not violent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

Some films, however, offer sensitive and thoughtful portrayals, such as *Karthik Calling Karthik* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. The Haryanvi web series *Opri Paraai* also accurately depicts psychotherapeutic rules, including creating environments of safety, confidentiality, and trust, and showing real-life techniques like guided imagery and Bandler's handshake used in hypnotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding illnesses like DID is crucial to avoid stigmatizing mental health conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. Seeking professional help from a therapist for stress, anxiety, depression, or irritability is as important as consulting a cardiologist for heart problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. The belief in ghosts, demons, or witches as causes for such conditions is outdated in the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

The year 2001 saw a wave of panic sweep across Delhi and its surrounding areas, driven by reports of a mysterious creature known as the "Monkey-Man." This phenomenon, later widely attributed to [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | mass hysteria]], led to widespread fear, vigilantism, and even fatalities.

## Initial Incidents and Spread of Panic

The first reported attack occurred on April 5, 2001, in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, where Anil Gopal was sleeping on his rooftop due to frequent power cuts and the summer heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Around 2 AM, he was jolted awake by an attack that left him with scratches on his arms and legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. He could only see a monkey-like figure disappearing into the darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Two weeks later, on April 18, Vinod from the same neighborhood reported a similar attack at 3:15 AM by a creature he also described as monkey-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The very next night, Raihasuddin was attacked in his hut, sustaining injuries so severe that he required 21 days to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

These incidents quickly escalated, and the "terror of the black money" (Monkey-Man) spread across Delhi and its neighboring areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. People reported scratches, bites, and injuries, often describing the attacker as a "half monkey and half human" or a "Monkey-Man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Between April and May 2001, Delhi Police received approximately 100 calls reporting Monkey-Man attacks from over 65 locations across Ghaziabad, East Delhi, Noida, and other parts of Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The typical story involved being attacked while sleeping outdoors at night, with the creature disappearing without a trace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Descriptions of the Monkey-Man

Descriptions of the Monkey-Man varied wildly among victims, suggesting that no one had seen the creature clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   One of the first victims, Ajay, claimed the Monkey-Man was fair-complexioned, with blue eyes, a big nose, and possibly of Nepali origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   Later victims described it as more monkey-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Sizes ranged from 8 feet tall to 4-5 feet, or even like a housecat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   The most popular descriptions included a helmet, a T-shirt with three buttons (one for transforming into a monkey, one for super strength, and one for invisibility), long, sharp, metallic nails, red eyes, and the ability to jump exceptionally high (20 ft between roofs), possibly due to springs on its feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Some even claimed it had electric currents running through its arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   With each new incident, the description became more supernatural, evolving from a man to a monkey, then to a "supernatural, super-human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The varying accounts led to beliefs that it was a shapeshifter, intentionally changing its appearance to mislead people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Impact of the Panic

The widespread terror in Delhi due to the Monkey-Man led to three deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. People would shout "Monkey-Man is coming, run for your lives!" leading to panic and chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In the ensuing stampedes, many people were injured, with dozens suffering fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. One person died from jumping off a rooftop, and a pregnant woman died after slipping on stairs in terror after merely seeing a shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The fear escalated into paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. People stopped sleeping outdoors and called the police for minor things like shadows or random sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Vigilante groups formed, armed with sticks and weapons, to patrol and attack the Monkey-Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This paranoia led to innocent people being attacked; in one case, a group of 150 people attacked a suspected Monkey-Man who was later found innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. A van driver was brutally attacked and had several bones broken, and a man named Raghunath Pathak was attacked by his own brother who mistook him for the Monkey-Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Police Response and Decline of Incidents

With no proper description of the Monkey-Man, the Delhi Police attempted to create sketches based on victim accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. They produced two sketches: one with a broad face and big nose, and another with a narrow face, moustache, and sunglasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Both depicted the Monkey-Man as more human than monkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Over 3,000 police officers were deployed to Monkey-Man hotspots at night, and authorities ensured uninterrupted power supply in these areas to prevent incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. On May 17, former Delhi Police Commissioner Ajay Raj Sharma announced a reward of â‚¹50,000 for information leading to the Monkey-Man's arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

After May 25, 2001, the incidents slowly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Delhi Police began taking strict action against fake callers, issuing public warnings that spreading rumors or misleading the police would lead to imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Out of 379 calls received, 303 were found to be fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Several people were arrested for spreading false rumors, including a doctor who inflated a surgical glove, painted it brown, and claimed it was the Monkey-Man's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This deterrence, coupled with the media losing interest, led to the complete cessation of Monkey-Man incidents within a few weeks and months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## The Mystery Explained: [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | Mass Hysteria]]

Psychologists widely classify the Monkey-Man phenomenon as a case of [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | Mass Hysteria]] or Mass Psychogenic Illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This is a phenomenon where a group of people display unusual, irrational behavior, believe in illogical things, and experience irrational feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. It is highly contagious but not a physical illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Doctors S.K. Verma and D.K. Srivastava from Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in New Delhi investigated 397 calls about Monkey-Man attacks and found only 51 worthy of medical examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Their 2003 study in the Indian Journal of Medical Sciences concluded that the Monkey-Man case was a typical example of [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | Mass Hysteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Contributing Factors to the Hysteria
According to the doctors, several factors contributed to the rapid spread of fear and panic:
*   **Trigger:** Simple shadows or random sounds at night in the dark acted as triggers, instilling fear that spread like a virus among families, neighbors, and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **High Population Density and Socio-Economic Status:** Incidents occurred in high-population density areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. A significant majority (94%) of victims were from poorer sections of society, living in low-income locales of East Delhi, and 89% had a lower socio-economic status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These individuals, often less educated, were more superstitious and prone to imagination over logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. When those around them believed a made-up story, they also began to believe it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_media_in_spreading_mass_hysteria | Role of Media]]:** The burgeoning private news channels in 2001 (like Star News and Aaj Tak) were competing for viewership and began sensationalizing the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Many people fabricated stories of Monkey-Man sightings to appear on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. At the time, the public, having just transitioned from DD News, blindly believed private news channels, assuming anything reported was true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Police also blamed the media for fueling the [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | mass hysteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   **Psychological and Environmental Stress:** Cases of [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | mass hysteria]] are often seen in people under psychological or environmental stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Two-thirds of the reported Monkey-Man attacks involved men aged 20-30, who were working in low-income, stressful jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. The summer heat and frequent power cuts added to their environmental stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

## Nature of Injuries and False Reports

While the injuries reported by victims were real, investigations by Delhi Police and doctors found them to be caused by rodents, stray dogs, or blunt objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Many scratches were attributed to people colliding with objects or falling while running in panic during power cuts, especially between midnight and 6 AM when they were jolted awake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

The Indian Rationalist Association suggested some cases were instances of "Mass Self-Delusion," where attention-seeking individuals intentionally inflicted injuries to gain media attention and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

Delhi Police also suspected that many calls were simply a means for residents to get their electricity restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. They noticed a pattern: areas reporting Monkey-Man incidents would calm down once power was restored, as people would then go indoors to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This led to the policy of jailing those who made false reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

## Cultural Significance and Parallels

The Monkey-Man incident became a notable cultural phenomenon, even depicted in the film "Delhi 6" starring Abhishek Bachchan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

Other examples of [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | mass hysteria]] include:
*   **Spring-Heeled Jack (England, 1837-1904):** Reports of a man in a trench coat with red eyes and metal nails who scratched women, with no trace ever found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
*   **Braid Chopping Incidents (India, 2017):** Women in Haryana and Delhi reported fainting and waking up to find their braids chopped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

These incidents often share common factors: occurrences in less educated, poorer communities with low socio-economic status, among highly superstitious individuals suffering psychological and environmental stress, with rumors and media playing a significant role in their spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

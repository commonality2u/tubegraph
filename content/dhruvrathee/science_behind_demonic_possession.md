In 2005, the popular Hollywood film *The Exorcism of Emily Rose* was released, claiming to be "Based on a true story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This film was based on the story of [[anneliese_michels_exorcism_and_mental_health | Anneliese Michel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, one of the most famous exorcism incidents in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This article explores the scientific explanations behind alleged cases of demonic possession.

## The Case of Anneliese Michel

Anneliese Michel was born in 1952 in West Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. At age 16, she fainted in school and entered a strange trance-like state for a minute or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. That same night, she woke up feeling a heavy weight on her body and realized she had wet the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. A year later, a similar incident occurred, prompting her parents to take her to a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Doctors and neurologists found nothing wrong with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

In February 1970, Anneliese was hospitalized for tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. While in the hospital, she reported seeing strange colors and hearing voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Doctors diagnosed her with temporal lobe epilepsy, causing seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, her case became unique a few days later when she began experiencing dangerous hallucinations, seeing and hearing things no one else could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Voices in her head told her she was cursed, leading to depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Her behavior escalated:
*   She began kneeling for prayer around 600 times a day, damaging her knee ligaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   She hid under a table and barked like a dog for two consecutive days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   She ate a spider, a piece of coal, and a bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Unable to get answers from doctors, her parents sought an exorcism from a bishop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. An exorcism is a religious procedure to remove an evil spirit from a person's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. It was believed that six demons resided in [[anneliese_michels_exorcism_and_mental_health | Anneliese Michel]]'s body: Adolf Hitler, Roman Emperor Nero, Judas, Cain, Lucifer, and Valentin Fleischmann (a German Catholic priest expelled for alcoholism and murder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. During the exorcism, the alleged demons reportedly spoke, and audio clips are still available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Scientific Explanations: Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)

The scientific explanation for phenomena like [[anneliese_michels_exorcism_and_mental_health | Anneliese Michel]]'s case, often referred to as "demonic possession," is Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Understanding Identity
DID involves a person having multiple distinct personalities, or "alters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This concept relates to the complexities of identity, which psychologist Carl Rogers describes as being made up of three parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>:
1.  **The actual self**: The person you are in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
2.  **The self-image**: The person you think you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This can be affected by cognitive biases like the Dunning-Kruger effect, where individuals overestimate their abilities despite a lack of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
3.  **The ideal self**: The person you aspire to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

When there's a significant difference between a person's self-image and their ideal self, it can lead to low self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Identities are complex, influenced by habits, environment, pride, embarrassment, regrets, secrets, fears, desires, and fantasies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Manifestations of DID
In DID, these multiple identities can "dissociate" into different personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. A person can have two, four, five, or even twenty alters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. A famous case is Kim Noble, who has over 100 distinct personalities, each with a different name, age, gender identity, temperament, body language, and memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

While many people exhibit different behaviors in various social contexts (e.g., with friends vs. parents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, DID is an extreme form where not just behavior, but names, ages, and even memories change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. There is usually a "Host Identity" or "Primary Identity" that is present most of the time, often the birth name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. In Kim Noble's case, her alter, Patricia, became her primary host identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

A key feature of personality switches in DID is that the memory of the other personality's actions or experiences disappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This can lead to frequent memory losses, a poor sense of time, and unexplained actions like forgetting keys or finding a car parked miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Individuals with DID often don't know they have the disorder, only noticing memory gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Anneliese Michel's Death and Diagnosis
Tragically, [[anneliese_michels_exorcism_and_mental_health | Anneliese Michel]] was not as fortunate as those who receive proper treatment for DID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. She underwent 67 exorcisms in 10 months and subsequently passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Her death was attributed to starvation and acute dehydration, with her weight dropping to 32 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Her death became a national scandal, leading to legal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Investigations revealed that Anneliese had been under psychiatric care since age 16 and had responded positively to medication and therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Her physicians stated she suffered from three mental illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>:
1.  **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
2.  **Anorexia Nervosa**: A disorder where individuals have a distorted perception of their weight, leading to dangerously low body weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
3.  **Hyper-Religious Personality Disorder**: A condition where religious beliefs become so intense that mystical experiences and delusions about spirituality are reported, often leading to obsessions with "unholy" things and worries about sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Anneliese's extremely religious upbringing by her parents is believed to have contributed to her belief in demons, leading her to associate them with figures like Hitler, Judas, or Luciferâ€”names she knew from her Christian background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. A professor at Wuertzburg University concluded that her condition was a "heavy psychic disturbance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The District Attorney stated that her death could have been prevented with timely medical assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, leading to her parents and two Roman Catholic priests being convicted of negligent homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

### The Root Cause of DID: Trauma
Research in the US, Canada, and Europe indicates that approximately 90% of DID cases are linked to some form of childhood abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This abuse causes trauma, leaving a mental wound that the brain copes with through dissociation, splitting into different personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. While a coping mechanism, dissociation is a serious mental illness that can lead to stress, anxiety, severe depression, addiction, and in some cases, self-harm or violence towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

Treatment for DID, primarily psychotherapy, aims to help patients remember and accept the traumatic event to reintegrate their scattered identities into a single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

## The Spectrum of Dissociation

Dissociation exists on a spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, with mild cases being common. Studies suggest that 50-74% of people experience at least one dissociative episode in their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Only in extreme cases does it lead to DID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

Mild cases of dissociation include:
*   **Dissociative Amnesia**: Forgetting details about a traumatic episode because the mind dissociates it from time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   **Dissociative Fugue**: Confusion about past events and sometimes a sudden change in identity, often triggered by trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. An example is Michael Boatwright, an American man who, after fainting, woke up speaking Swedish and identified as "Johan Ek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. It was later discovered he had spent significant time in Sweden and had a traumatic personal history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **Depersonalisation**: Feeling detached from one's own actions, thoughts, and feelings, observing oneself as an outsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.
*   **Derealisation**: Feeling that the world and people around them are unreal, like a dream, with time moving strangely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## Portrayal of Mental Illness in Media

Unfortunately, many films portray mental health issues, especially DID, in a scary or insensitive way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Movies like *Bhool Bhulaiya* use mental illness for comic relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, depicting inappropriate "treatments" like slapping. Others, such as *Aparichit* or Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho*, sensationalize DID patients as violent and dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. This [[criticism_of_sensationalist_paranormal_media | sensationalist portrayal]] adds to the stigma around mental illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, even though most DID patients are not violent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

However, some films like *Karthik Calling Karthik* and the Haryanvi web series *Opri Paraai* offer more sensitive and accurate portrayals of DID and psychotherapy, showcasing techniques like guided imagery and Bandler's handshake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding these phenomena from a scientific perspective reveals that what was once attributed to "demonic possession" is, in reality, complex mental illnesses like Dissociative Identity Disorder. It is crucial to avoid creating stigma around mental illnesses and to recognize the importance of seeking professional help from a psychotherapist for conditions such as stress, anxiety, depression, or irritability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

When considering beliefs in ghosts, demons, or witches, it is important to question superstitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

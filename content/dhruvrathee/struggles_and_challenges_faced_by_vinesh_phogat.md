Vinesh Phogat, a distinguished Indian wrestler, has faced numerous [[Challenges Faced by Survivors | struggles and challenges]] throughout her career, from personal tragedies and societal resistance to severe injuries, mental health battles, and significant conflicts with the sports administration. Her life, much like the line from Dangal's title song, "From the womb to the grave, your story is an inspiration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>, perfectly encapsulates her journey of resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Societal Resistance
Born in Balali, Haryana, Vinesh's childhood was marked by tragedy when her father passed away when she was only nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. She was raised by her mother, Prem Lata, who also battled cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Vinesh attributes her courage to her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

Her training under uncle Mahavir Phogat, alongside her sister Priyanka and cousins Geeta, Babita, Ritu, and Sangeeta, took place in a village where women traditionally lived behind a veil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. They faced constant taunts and criticism from villagers who accused Mahavir of ruining the village's environment and making a spectacle of his daughters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. Vinesh's aunt Daya was told that their daughters would become manly, look ugly, and never marry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. Vinesh herself recalled being angered by comments about her attire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

## Physical Injuries and Setbacks

Vinesh Phogat's career has been punctuated by severe physical injuries that tested her resolve:
*   **Rio Olympics ACL Injury (2016)**: During her quarter-final match against China's Sun Yanan at the Rio Olympics, Vinesh suffered an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tear, an injury so severe that she had to be carried out on a stretcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This injury led her to doubt if she would ever wrestle again, causing her to cry herself to sleep and upon waking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. She received the Arjun Award that year in a wheelchair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
*   **Concussion (2017)**: In 2017, Vinesh suffered a concussion, a mild traumatic brain injury, which caused her vision to blur whenever her head was struck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.
*   **Elbow Injury and Surgery (2021)**: During the 2021 national trials for the World Championship, Vinesh withdrew due to an elbow injury that required surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>. Despite this, she vowed to rise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.
*   **Left Knee Ligament Tears (2023)**: In August 2023, she sustained a complete tear in her anterior cruciate ligament and a partial tear in her lateral collateral ligament of her left knee during a training session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>. This injury prevented her from participating in the Asian Games in Guangzhou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>.

## Mental Health Challenges

Vinesh Phogat has openly spoken about her struggles with mental health:
*   **Depression Diagnosis**: Two years before the Tokyo Olympics, she was diagnosed with depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. She experienced severe insomnia, staying awake for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Vulnerability**: At the Lucknow Camp, even coaches raising their tone would make her cry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:10:00]</a>. She feared the illness would be the end of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. She consulted a psychologist as she couldn't share everything with her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.
*   **Tokyo Olympics Performance**: Despite being the World No. 1 in her weight class and a strong contender for an Olympic medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>, she experienced physical pain, vomiting, shivering, and her mind blanked out during her second bout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>.

## Impact of COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic introduced further complications:
*   **Health Issues**: In August 2020, Vinesh contracted COVID-19, which subsequently affected her body's ability to digest protein properly, a critical component for a wrestler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 again in April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.
*   **Family Impact**: Her entire family had COVID when she went to Bulgaria after her recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.

## Conflicts with Wrestling Federation of India (WFI)

Vinesh Phogat faced significant challenges due to the alleged mismanagement and problematic policies of the [[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | Wrestling Federation of India (WFI)]]:
*   **Lack of Support at Tokyo Olympics**: Despite repeated requests, Vinesh was not provided with a dedicated physiotherapist at the Tokyo Olympics, which was crucial for weight cutting and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. She had to rely on a physiotherapist accompanying the shooting team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.
*   **WFI Accusations of Indiscipline**: Following her performance at the Tokyo Olympics, the [[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | WFI]] temporarily suspended Vinesh for indiscipline, citing three charges, including not staying or training with teammates and not wearing the kit sponsor's jersey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. Vinesh clarified that she adhered to quarantine rules, stayed with the 4x400 women athletes to avoid COVID risk, and an unintentional oversight led to her not wearing the official jersey during her bout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>. Although forgiven, she was threatened with a lifetime ban for any future mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Simone Biles**: Vinesh highlighted the double standards by contrasting her treatment with that of American gymnast Simone Biles, who withdrew from an Olympic event due to mental health concerns and received support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>. Vinesh noted that she was treated like a "non-living thing" and judged rather than being asked about her struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Coaches and [[Supportive Role of NGOs in Indian Wrestling | NGO]] Interference**: The [[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | WFI]] also raised allegations against Vinesh's coach, Woller Akos, despite his significant contribution to her success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. The [[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | WFI]] had problems with foreign coaches and sought to prevent [[Supportive Role of NGOs in Indian Wrestling | NGOs]] like Olympic Gold Quest and JSW from interfering, claiming they "spoiled" wrestlers and that WFI could manage its athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. This contradicted their failure to provide adequate support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>.
*   **[[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | Sexual Misconduct Allegations and Protests]]**: In 2023, Vinesh Phogat, along with Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, led a major protest against [[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh]], the then-WFI chief, over allegations of sexual misconduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. The wrestlers had to protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar just to get an FIR lodged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. They were dragged on the streets by the police, an image that remains historical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>.
*   **Political Indifference and Media Trial**: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who previously called Vinesh "family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>, remained silent during the protests because Brij Bhushan was a BJP MP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a>. A large-scale propaganda campaign and media trial were launched against the protesting wrestlers, with lies spread and AI used to morph their faces to defame them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.
*   **[[Wrestling Federation of Indias Policy and Trials | WFI Policy Changes and Quota Trials]]**: The [[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | WFI]] controversially changed its policy, stating that even Olympic quota winners could be called for trials, but also allowed the WFI to skip trials if deemed unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>. When Antim Panghal secured the 53 kg category quota for the Paris Olympics, the Ad Hoc Committee initially assured trials but then abruptly cancelled them, citing a "one-time-only exemption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>. This decision, under Sanjay Singh's presidency, deprived Vinesh of the opportunity to compete for the 53 kg spot, forcing her to compete in the 50 kg category instead to secure her place at the Paris Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>.

## [[Vinesh Phogats Disqualification from Paris Olympics | Paris Olympics Disqualification]] (2024)

Despite her perseverance, Vinesh Phogat faced a shocking disqualification from the Paris Olympics:
*   **Overweight Disqualification**: After winning her first three matches and reaching the final, Vinesh was disqualified for being just 100 grams overweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Weight Management Struggle**: Her natural weight is 55-56 kg, making it challenging to maintain 50 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. After her semifinal, her weight was 52.7 kg, and she had 12 hours to lose 2.7 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. She spent the night running, skipping, cycling, going to the sauna, cutting her hair, and having blood drawn, losing 2.6 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. However, 100 grams remained, leading to her disqualification at the 7:15 AM weigh-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Public Reaction**: This incident sparked public outrage, with American athlete Jordan Burroughs appealing for rules to be changed and Vinesh to be awarded a silver medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. However, some, like BJP MP Hema Malini, made insensitive remarks, while others on social media blamed Vinesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya highlighted the ₹7 million spent on her, a point criticized by many given the lavish spending of politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Retirement Announcement**: Following her disqualification, Vinesh Phogat announced her retirement on Twitter, stating, "Mother, wrestling won over me, I lost... I don't have any more strength. Goodbye, wrestling, 2001 - 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Legacy of Resilience

Despite the constant battles, Vinesh Phogat repeatedly demonstrated remarkable resilience. She made successful comebacks, winning gold medals in the 2014, 2018, and 2022 Commonwealth Games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>, and becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to win gold at the Asian Games in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. She secured a bronze medal at the 2019 World Championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a> and was ranked World No. 1 in her weight class before the Tokyo Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>.

Vinesh Phogat's story is one of unwavering dedication, battling not only opponents on the mat but also personal adversity, physical injuries, mental health issues, and systemic corruption within the sport. Her efforts to make Indian wrestling a safer space and her numerous international medals have cemented her legacy as an inspiration for future generations of athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>. Although she could not win a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, her inspirational journey has won the hearts of fellow Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:24:00">[30:24:00]</a>.

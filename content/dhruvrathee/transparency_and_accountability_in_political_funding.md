The Electoral Bond Scheme has been described as potentially "the biggest scam in the history of independent India" and the "biggest extortion racket in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It is viewed as a collection of various scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The core of the alleged fraud involves a "kickbacks for business opportunities" model, where companies give kickbacks in exchange for business opportunities, or face action by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) if they don't comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## The Electoral Bond Scheme

The Modi government introduced the Electoral Bonds Scheme in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, making it a mechanism for [[corporate_funding_and_political_donations | political parties]] to collect kickbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced its contours for funding political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Secrecy of Transactions
> A key feature of the scheme was to hide every transaction from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Citizens were not allowed to know which companies paid what amounts to which parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Concerns were raised at the time that this would lead to a major financial scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, with some stating that it made "corruption legal in India" as companies would not need to reveal their funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### How Electoral Bonds Worked
Electoral bonds functioned like coupons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. A company would pay a bank to purchase these coupons, which were then given to [[corporate_funding_and_political_donations | political parties]]. The parties could redeem the coupons for money from the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. If a political party did not encash a bond within 15 days, the money used to purchase the unclaimed bond would be transferred to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Revelation of Secret Tracking Numbers
Initial claims by the government stated that the identity of electoral bond buyers would remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. However, an investigation by journalist Poonam Agarwal, who bought two electoral bonds, revealed that every bond had a secret Unique Alphanumeric Number visible only under ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

After this revelation, the Finance Ministry acknowledged the existence of these secret numbers, claiming they were merely a security feature and would not be used to track donations or ascertain buyer identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also defended this point in Parliament, reassuring opposition parties that donor identities would remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

However, an RTI filed by retired Navy Officer Lokesh Batra and records reviewed by HuffPost India showed that the State Bank of India (SBI) required serial numbers for audit trails and to prevent forgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. A January 2018 notification also stated that SBI had to provide electoral bond details to any law enforcement agency upon request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This implied that agencies like the ED or CBI could easily ascertain which company donated which electoral bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

This established three key points regarding transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>:
1.  The public was to remain unaware of the scale and sources of [[corporate_funding_and_political_donations | political donations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
2.  Opposition parties were not to know about donations made to the ruling party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
3.  The ruling BJP government had access to all information about donors and recipient parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, turning it into a secret weapon against the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Supreme Court Intervention and Data Revelation

On February 15, the Supreme Court declared the Electoral Bond Scheme unconstitutional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This decision was based on a petition filed by the CPI(M) political party and NGOs Common Cause and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), with Advocate Prashant Bhushan arguing on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

The Supreme Court's ruling highlighted two significant concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>:
1.  Citizens have the right to know about the quantum and sources of [[corporate_funding_and_political_donations | political donations]], and the scheme violated this right to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
2.  The Court expressed concern that the scheme was used to facilitate kickbacks, classifying contributions as "purely business transactions" where companies donated for benefits in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Based on these findings, the Court directed SBI to release the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Despite SBI's initial excuses about needing three months to collate the data and suggesting disclosure only after elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, the Court's firm stance led to the data being released within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Data Publication and Further Directives
The data was published on the Election Commission's website in two lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>:
1.  Companies and individuals who bought electoral bonds and their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
2.  Political parties that encashed the bonds and the amounts received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

However, SBI initially did not reveal the secret alphanumeric numbers, making it impossible to directly connect the two lists and link donors to recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The Supreme Court again rebuked SBI for selectively publishing data and directed them to publish the full data, including the secret numbers, by March 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Some political parties proactively revealed their donor lists to the public, including Samajwadi Party, Aam Aadmi Party, National Congress Party, JD(U), JD(S), DMK, AIADMK, JKNC, MGP (Goa), and SDF (Sikkim) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Four parties, CPI, CPI-M, All-India Forward Bloc, and CPI-ML, never accepted electoral bonds as a matter of principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Allegations of Corruption and Extortion

The core of the alleged fraud involves a three-way interaction: the political party in power, large companies making [[corporate_funding_and_political_donations | political donations]] through electoral bonds, and the common public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The accusation is that the government transferred public funds (tax money) to companies, and in return, companies transferred money to the political party through electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

While giving or receiving political donations is not inherently a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, it becomes a scam when donations lead to contracts paid with public tax money, or when companies that don't donate are harassed by agencies like the ED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The scheme is accused of creating a vast [[scams_and_corruption_in_political_donations | extortion racket]], shattering democratic principles, and stealing public funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Rahul Gandhi termed Prime Minister Modi as "Vasuli Bhai," meaning someone who runs an extortion racket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Misinformation and Media Influence
> Home Minister Amit Shah's statement at the India Today conclave, claiming total bonds sold were ₹200 billion (BJP getting ₹60 billion, leaving ₹140 billion for others) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, was fact-checked against ECI data. ECI data shows total bonds encashed between April 2019 and January 2024 were ₹127 billion, with BJP receiving ₹60 billion (47.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

> Media entities like ANI, Dainik Jagran, and India Today published this unverified information, leading to accusations of being "government's puppet media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This highlights concerns about the [[impact_of_political_influence_on_media | impact of political influence on media]].

### Examples of Alleged Scams

1.  **Tax Evasion and Agency Raids**: Many top donor companies, including Future Gaming, Megha Engineering, and Vedanta, were raided by the ED and Income Tax Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. An analysis of the top 30 donors found that 14 had faced raids by these agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. It's alleged that companies received a "free pass" on illegal activities or tax evasions in exchange for [[scams_and_corruption_in_political_donations | political donations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
2.  **[[influence_of_political_donations_on_government_contracts | Influence of Political Donations on Government Contracts]]**: The General Financial Rules state that public officers should exercise caution while spending public money, and contracts for public projects should be awarded based on eligibility criteria, past performance, technical capability, and financial position to ensure best quality work at appropriate prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. However, concerns were raised about deviations from this.
    *   **Navayuga Engineering Company Limited**: Awarded the contract for the Uttarakhand tunnel where 41 workers were trapped after a collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This company bought ₹550 million in electoral bonds between 2019 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
    *   **Ranjit Buildcon**: An under-construction flyover built by this company collapsed in Ahmedabad in December 2021, the third such incident involving the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. The inquiry found compromised quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Despite this, it received multiple projects from Gujarat's civic bodies and the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar metro rail project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Between January and July 2023, the company bought ₹90 million in electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
    *   **BG Shirke Construction Private Limited**: This Pune-based company purchased ₹1.18 billion in electoral bonds between January 2023 and January 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. An FIR was registered against it in June 2022 for causing death by negligence, after 4 people died in an elevator crash at its housing project site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Another incident in October 2018 led to 4 deaths from a tower crane fall at its construction site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
    *   **Megha Engineering**: Purchased ₹9.66 billion in electoral bonds between 2019 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
        *   **Kaleshwaram Multipurpose Irrigation Project (Telangana)**: Inaugurated in June 2019, its estimated cost escalated from ₹810 billion to over ₹14.7 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. A CAG report revealed Megha Engineering was paid ₹51.80 billion in excess for four packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Other contractors like L&T and Navayuga Engineering also received undue benefits, totaling at least ₹75 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

On the morning of October 7th, at 6:30 AM, a new conflict erupted between [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] and Palestine, beginning with air raid sirens blaring across Israeli cities while most Israelis were still asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Initial Assault: Operation Al-Aqsa Flood

Thousands of rockets were fired at Israeli cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) estimated 2,200 rockets, while Hamas claimed 5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Iron Dome Failure
Despite [[israels_defense_systems_and_their_effectiveness | Israel's Iron Dome system]], one of the world's best air defense systems designed to intercept rockets mid-flight, it failed to protect the country against the onslaught of 5,000 rockets fired within 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This led to thousands of people being killed and injured in [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Surprise and Scope
This surprise attack was the biggest in decades within the [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel-Palestine conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, reminiscent of the Yom Kippur War 50 years prior, when Egypt and Syria launched a similar surprise attack on [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] in October 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The recent assault is considered a full-scale war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Multi-pronged Attack
In addition to rockets, Hamas launched a multi-pronged attack by ground, sea, and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>:
*   **Ground Infiltration**: The boundary wall on the [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]]-Gaza border was breached by a bulldozer, allowing Palestinians to enter Israeli territory on motorcycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Air Infiltration**: Motor-powered hang-gliders were used to enter [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Sea Attack**: Hamas also attacked [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] from the sea using speedboats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Within a day, a military base on the [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]]-Gaza border was attacked, an Israeli tank captured, and many Israeli soldiers were taken hostage by Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Hamas armed terrorists infiltrated Israeli villages and cities near the border, killing innocent civilians and taking others hostage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Hamas's Stated Reasons
Hamas's military commander, Mohammad Al-Deif, named the attack "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He stated that Hamas initiated the attack due to atrocities committed by [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] against Palestinians, specifically in response to events at the Al-Aqsa mosque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Geographical Context

[[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] and Palestine are located in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Their neighbors include Lebanon to the North, Syria to the Northeast, Jordan to the East, Egypt to the Southwest, and the Mediterranean Sea to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The territory of Palestine is divided into two parts:
*   **West Bank**: Located west of Jordan, this region contains many Israeli settlements that are under Israeli control and considered illegal by the United Nations and other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The West Bank is administered by Palestinian Authorities under the Fatah political party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Gaza Strip**: Located southwest of [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] and bordering Egypt, the Gaza Strip is controlled independently by Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Historically, Fatah and Hamas have had separate conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Hamas: Organization and International Status

Hamas is described as an extremist Palestinian organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Designated Terrorist Organization**: Canada, the European Union, [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]], Japan, Australia, the USA, and the UK designate Hamas as a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Not Designated Terrorist Organization**: Brazil, China, Egypt, [[iran_and_israel_conflict_and_missile_attacks | Iran]], Norway, Qatar, Russia, Syria, and Turkey do not consider Hamas a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Military Wing Only**: New Zealand and Paraguay consider only Hamas's military wing as a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. These differing geopolitical stances influence how countries react to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## [[israels_military_response_and_international_reactions | Israel's Military Response]]: Operation Iron Swords

In response to the Hamas attacks, [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] declared a state of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The counter-offensive was named "Operation Iron Swords" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) deployed their Navy, Air Force, and Ground Forces, launching drone strikes in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]]'s Energy Minister signed an order to cut electricity supply to Gaza, much of which was previously supplied by [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated, "Citizens of [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]], we are at war," vowing that the enemy would pay an unprecedented price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The defense minister asserted that Hamas made a huge mistake and [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] would win the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## [[controversies_and_failures_of_israeli_intelligence | Intelligence Failure]]

A significant talking point in the conflict is the failure of Mossad, [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]]'s world-famous intelligence agency, to intercept the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Mossad is considered one of the most powerful intelligence agencies, with informants even in Palestinian military groups globally, and a history of precise assassinations of military leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Questions arose as to how such a powerful agency did not know about thousands of rockets being stockpiled in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The smart barriers along the Gaza-[[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] border, equipped with cameras, ground motion sensors, and regular army patrols, also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Domestically, the Israeli government faces criticism for this failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. A former head of the Israeli Navy called it a "huge failure" on the part of the government, and a major investigation into this intelligence failure has begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The Times of [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] reported that Egyptian intelligence officials had repeatedly warned [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] of an impending major event, but these warnings were allegedly ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## [[israels_military_response_and_international_reactions | International Reactions]]

International reactions to the attacks varied:
*   **United States**: President Joe Biden condemned the attack and pledged "rock-solid and unwavering support" for [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **European Union**: The foreign policy chief condemned the attack and affirmed [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]]'s right to defend itself under international law, demanding the immediate release of Israeli hostages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **[[iran_and_israel_conflict_and_missile_attacks | Iran]]**: [[iran_and_israel_conflict_and_missile_attacks | Iran]]'s foreign ministry, a key supporter of Hamas, stated that the attack was an act of self-defense by Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Egypt**: The foreign ministry of Egypt announced discussions with Saudi Arabia and Jordan to de-escalate [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israeli-Palestinian tensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Palestine**: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stated that Palestinians have the right to protect themselves against "the terror of the settlers and foreign troops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Abbas is from the Fatah party, which governs the West Bank and has historical conflicts with Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **India**: Historically, India has supported the Palestinian cause of self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, with Prime Minister Modi being the first Indian PM to visit Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. However, Prime Minister Modi's recent statement expressed shock at the terrorist attacks and solidarity with [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] and its innocent victims, condemning Hamas's actions as terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations

The video emphasizes that while the Palestinian cause deserves support due to historical injustices against common Palestinians, supporting terrorists is not acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Disturbing videos showing Hamas terrorists mistreating women and civilians have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The killing of common people in [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] through such terrorism cannot be justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Conversely, [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]], as a powerful country with a democratic government, is urged to use its powers responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The video condemns communal bigots on both sides who celebrate attacks or call for the eradication of the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. It urges empathy for the ordinary Israeli and Palestinian families experiencing the fear and halt of life due to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

[[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel]] claims to carry out its counter-offensive responsibly, citing instances where 10-15 minute warnings were given before airstrikes on buildings in Palestine to allow evacuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. However, it is acknowledged that many Palestinian civilians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

The hope for long-lasting peace remains, though the current situation suggests the war will continue for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

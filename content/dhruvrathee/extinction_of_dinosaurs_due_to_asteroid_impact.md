Around 100 million years ago, Earth was a vastly different planet, dominated by colossal and formidable creatures known as dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These "terrible lizards," a literal translation from their Greek etymology "Denios" (Terrible) and "Sauros" (Lizard), ruled the Earth for over 170 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Some were taller than buildings, had jaws strong enough to crush bones, and could run at speeds of around 90 km/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Their reign, however, came to an abrupt end due to a cataclysmic event.

## Understanding Dinosaurs

The term "dinosaur" was coined in 1841 by British scientist Richard Owen after the first dinosaur fossil was discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Initial drawings of dinosaurs like *Megalosaurus* were vastly different from current understanding due to limited knowledge at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Today, palaeontologists have unearthed over 10,000 dinosaur fossils, identifying more than 900 distinct species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The work continues, with about 45 new dinosaur species identified annually between 2003 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Notable recent discoveries include *Stegouros Elengassen* from Chile, characterized by a blade-like tail weapon and a beak-like mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### [[dinosaur_evolution_through_triassic_to_cretaceous_periods | Dinosaur Eras and Evolution]]

Scientists estimate that the first dinosaurs emerged approximately 230-240 million years ago, with the oldest fossil, found in Africa, dating back 231.4 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

#### Triassic Period (approx. 252 to 201 million years ago)

During this period, Earth's continents were joined as a single supercontinent called Pangaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The climate was dry and arid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Early dinosaurs, like *Eoraptor* (believed to be an ancestor of other dinosaurs), were generally small, around 2 meters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The dominant animals of this era were giant reptiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

#### Triassic-Jurassic Extinction Event (approx. 201 million years ago)

The Triassic period ended due to a sudden climate change and the breakup of Pangaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This gradual process, unfolding over thousands of years, involved large-scale volcanic explosions that released immense amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This led to intense global warming, followed by cooling due to aerosols blocking sunlight, and ocean acidification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Most cold-blooded reptiles struggled with these rapid temperature changes and became extinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, dinosaurs, being warm-blooded, were better equipped to tolerate the fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This event led to the extinction of almost all other species, leaving primarily dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and early mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

#### Jurassic Period (approx. 201 to 145 million years ago)

Following the extinction event, dinosaurs emerged as the planet's most dominant species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Through evolution, some grew to immense sizes, such as the early *Titanosaurus*, weighing up to 15,000 kg and reaching 15 meters in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. During this period, Pangaea split into two smaller supercontinents: Laurasia and Gondwanaland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Some dinosaurs, like *Archaeopteryx*, evolved to fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

#### Cretaceous Period (approx. 145 to 65 million years ago)

This was the longest period in the era of dinosaurs, marked by an explosion in dinosaur diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Continents began to resemble their modern configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The average Earth temperature was warmer, sea levels were high, and various dinosaur types flourished, including:
*   **T-Rex:** The most famous dinosaur, reaching peak dominance at the end of this period (around 65-68 million years ago) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. It could be up to 40 feet long and possessed the strongest jaws of any animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It is notable that humans are closer in time to the T-Rex than the T-Rex was to the Jurassic Period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Argentinosaurus:** One of the largest land animals, weighing up to 77 tonnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Ornithomimids:** Ostrich-like dinosaurs that were among the fastest, running at 80 km/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Quetzalcoatlus:** The largest flying dinosaur, with a wingspan of 10-11 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Flowering plants also evolved during this time, though grass only began to evolve around 70 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The climate was favorable, and dinosaurs faced no significant competition, truly ruling the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## The Asteroid Impact and Mass Extinction

The reign of dinosaurs ended 66 million years ago with the impact of a large asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

### The Impact Event
A massive asteroid, estimated to be 10-15 km in diameter, crashed into Earth at a speed of 30 km per second, 150 times faster than a jet airliner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The impact site was the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, creating a crater 180 km in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The energy released was equivalent to 100 teratonnes of TNT, or 1 billion times the energy of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Immediate and Long-Term Consequences
The [[impact_of_asteroid_strikes_on_earth | impact of asteroid strikes on Earth]] had devastating effects:
*   **Initial Blast:** Everything within the immediate vicinity disintegrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Hot dust rained down, raising global temperatures by several degrees for hours, effectively cooking animals alive within thousands of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Only small animals found shelter underground, underwater, in caves, or in large tree trunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Secondary Catastrophes:** Shock waves, heat pulses, widespread wildfires, and tsunamis (speculated to be up to 2 km tall) followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Volcanic eruptions resumed, and acid rain fell, accompanied by earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Winter:** The most deadly long-term consequence was the dust thrown into the atmosphere, which blocked sunlight for the next year globally, plunging the planet into a "nuclear winter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Temperatures dropped to freezing for an estimated three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Ecological Collapse:** Without sunlight, plants died due to the inability to photosynthesize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This led to a chain reaction: herbivorous animals starved, followed by carnivorous animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Post-Nuclear Winter:** After the dust settled, a large amount of carbon dioxide remained in the atmosphere, leading to intense global warming for thousands of years, with reduced sunlight and continued acid rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

### Survivors
Only small omnivorous animals, such as mammals, lizards, turtles, and some birds, could survive by scavenging on dead dinosaurs, fungi, and decaying plant matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. No four-legged creature weighing more than 25 kg survived this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Over 75% of Earth's plant and animal species went extinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Paleogene Period and Dinosaur Legacy

The asteroid strike ended the Cretaceous period, marking the start of the Paleogene period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This event, while catastrophic, opened an opportunity for other animal species to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The extinction of dinosaurs allowed for the rapid evolution of mammals, filling the ecological gaps left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. This era saw the evolution of horses, whales, bats, primates, snakes, and smaller lizards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

The only group of dinosaurs that survived were the flying dinosaurs, which gradually evolved into the [[birds_as_modern_descendants_of_dinosaurs | birds as modern descendants of dinosaurs]] we see today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Studies confirm that birds belong to the same family as dinosaurs, with chickens and ostriches sharing the closest ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This leads to the intriguing fact that the closest living relative of the T-Rex is a chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Evidence of the Impact

The evidence for the asteroid impact 66 million years ago is found in the presence of Iridium, a rare mineral on Earth but abundant in comets and asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. A high concentration of iridium layers found globally, carbon-dated to 66 million years old, indicates its widespread distribution after the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

The impact crater itself is hidden in the Yucatan Peninsula, partially submerged and partially on land, but its existence has been proven through digging expeditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. A visible real-world impact are the cenotes (sinkholes) in Mexico, which form a ring around the crater, showing the asteroid's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Modern Day Asteroid Threat and Human Impact

Today, space agencies like NASA continuously track Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) to predict potential collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. As of April 2022, over 28,000 NEAs have been identified, with more than 800 having a diameter of 1 km or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. While scientific calculations can predict their paths and collision chances, active measures are also being developed. NASA's DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission, launched in 2021, successfully demonstrated that a spacecraft collision could alter an asteroid's path, offering a potential defense mechanism against future threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

Despite these advancements, the primary danger to humanity is not an asteroid but rather human actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. The asteroid strike that wiped out the dinosaurs is considered the 5th extinction event in Earth's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Scientists believe the 6th extinction event, the [[current_humandriven_extinction_event | current humandriven extinction event]] known as the Holocene Extinction Event, has already begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

### The Holocene Extinction Event

Over the last 100-200 years, deforestation, and pollution of oceans and atmosphere have led to an unprecedented loss of biodiversity, with animal and plant species going extinct at a rate 100-1,000 times higher than the normal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Thousands of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians are endangered or already extinct due to human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

In response, international efforts like the 2010 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity Meeting in Japan set 20 biodiversity targets by 2020, though only six were partially achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. A new "Paris-style plan" in January 2020 set a 2030 deadline to prevent biodiversity and ecosystem collapse, aiming to protect 30% of land and oceans and reduce pollution by at least 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. Scientists propose limiting extinctions to 20 per year or fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

Humans have only existed for about 300,000 years, a mere fraction of the 174 million years dinosaurs dominated Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. The continued existence of humanity hinges on collective efforts to protect the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

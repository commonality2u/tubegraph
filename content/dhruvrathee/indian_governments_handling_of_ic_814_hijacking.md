The [[ic_814_hijacking_incident_timeline | hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC 814]] on December 24, 1999, was the largest and last plane hijacking in Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The incident, which held the entire country's attention for seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, brought significant criticism upon the incumbent Indian government for its handling of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

## Initial Response and Communication Failures

The flight, carrying 11 crew members and 179 passengers, was hijacked by five individuals after taking off from Kathmandu, Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. They demanded $200 million and the release of certain terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

A major failing was in the initial communication and information dissemination:
*   Indian air traffic controllers (ATC) learned of the hijacking at 4:40 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra were informed an hour later, at 5:20 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Punjab’s Director General of Police, Sarabjit Singh, was notified around 6 PM, not through official channels but via TV news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This highlighted a significant "communication failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Even Home Minister L.K. Advani learned about the incident through news programs rather than the Crisis Management Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

## Blunders at Amritsar

The plane, facing low fuel and denied landing in Lahore, Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, was convinced by Captain Devi Sharan to land in Amritsar for refuelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The flight landed at Amritsar airport at 7:01 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This landing presented a "golden opportunity" and a "very advantageous" situation for India to regain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. However, what followed was a "historic blunder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>:

*   A local committee was formed to delay the plane, allowing time for commandos to develop a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Despite repeated requests from Captain Devi Sharan to refuel, no action was taken for 40 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. During this delay, hijackers injured a passenger, Satnam Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   A plan to puncture the tires by hiding officers in a fuel tanker was formulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. However, another ATC plan to block the plane with a tanker was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   Due to miscommunication, the tanker driver stopped abruptly in front of the plane, tipping off the hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   The hijackers, frustrated, forced Captain Sharan to take off without refuelling, nearly colliding with the tanker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The plane departed at 7:49 PM, just as NSG commandos arrived at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   A controversial theory suggested that the plane was allowed to take off to ensure the safety of Shashi Bhushan Singh Tomar, the brother-in-law of Prime Minister Vajpayee's Secretary N.K. Singh, who was a passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## Negotiations and Concessions

The flight eventually landed in Lahore after Pakistan's ATC initially denied permission and turned off airport lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. It was refuelled there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The plane later landed at Dubai’s Al Minhad Air Base, where 26 passengers were released after negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Another passenger, Rupin Katyal, was fatally attacked by hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

The plane then proceeded to Kandahar, Afghanistan, landing on December 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. The Taliban, then in power, offered to mediate, but India did not recognise their government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. An Indian High Commissioner and a team of negotiators, including Ajit Doval, were sent to Kandahar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

The hijackers' initial demands were for $200 million, the release of 36 prisoners, and the dead body of Sajjad Afghani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

*   Under intense pressure from the public and families of hostages, who protested and gatecrashed meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, the government was compelled to prioritise civilian lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   The demands were eventually narrowed down to the release of 3 prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   Despite initial reluctance from Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, two prisoners were released, with the argument that it would have negative long-term impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   On December 31, 1999, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh flew to Kandahar with the three prisoners, and their demands were met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. The passengers were released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## Consequences and Criticisms

The [[india_pakistan_involvement_in_ic_814_hijacking | involvement of Pakistan]] became clear as the hijackers were driven towards Pakistan's border by Taliban members, and it was revealed that most hijackers were from Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Ajit Doval claimed the hijackers received support from active ISI in Kandahar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

The government's handling was heavily criticised for failing to deal with the crisis effectively, especially the "big blunders committed by the government" at Amritsar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. A major negative consequence was the subsequent formation of the Jaish-e-Mohammad group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

## Aftermath and Improvements

Despite the severe criticism, the incident led to significant improvements in aviation [[security_issues_in_india | security in India]]. Fortunately, no other plane has been hijacked in India since IC 814 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Regulations and processes have been made extremely strict, making it difficult to hijack any plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This represents a positive [[impact_of_ic_814_hijacking_on_indian_aviation_security | impact]] on Indian aviation security.

The [[trade_and_political_strategies_of_the_east_india_company | British East India Company]] (EIC), initially a small trading venture, dramatically expanded its influence to establish control over the Indian subcontinent. Despite suffering a significant defeat against the Mughal Empire in 1686, the EIC, a foreign company, eventually came to govern most of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Foundation and Early Trade Efforts

The [[trade_and_political_strategies_of_the_east_india_company | East India Company]] was founded in 1600 by a group of merchants as a Joint Stock Company, owned by shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Initially, 125 shareholders raised £70,000 to trade in spices from the Spice Islands of Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. In 1601, its maiden voyage led to the establishment of two factories in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, the EIC faced stiff competition from established Spanish and Portuguese traders, and more recently, the more profitable and militarily superior Dutch traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Realizing they couldn't compete with the Dutch, the EIC decided to shift its operations and focus on India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Arrival and Initial Mughal Interactions

In 1608, EIC merchants arrived in India, landing in present-day Surat, Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. At the time, the [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Mughal Empire]], with an army of four million soldiers, was extremely powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The EIC officials sought friendly relations to gain permission to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Captain William Hawkins traveled to the Mughal capital, Agra, to meet Emperor Jahangir and request permission to set up a factory in Surat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Jahangir refused, as the [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the_17th_and_18th_centuries | Portuguese traders]] already had good relations with the Mughals in Surat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Unable to trade in Mughal territory, the EIC explored other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. In 1611, they successfully established their first factory in Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh, with permission from the local ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Establishing Dominance and Gaining Political Power

### Early Conflicts and Royal Influence

In 1612, the EIC returned to Surat and declared war on the [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the_17th_and_18th_centuries | Portuguese traders]] in the Battle of Swally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The Portuguese lost, and their influence diminished, largely restricting them to Goa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This victory made the EIC a major player in the Indian subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Following this, in 1615, the EIC requested English King James I to send a royal representative to the Mughal emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Sir Thomas Roe, a diplomat, was sent and successfully impressed Jahangir with gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Jahangir issued a royal edict permitting the English to set up factories in Surat and granted the EIC exclusive trading rights in certain territories in exchange for an annual payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Over subsequent decades, the EIC established numerous factories in cities like Madras, Ahmedabad, Bombay, Agra, and Patna, experiencing flourishing trade in cotton, indigo, silk, salt, and later opium and tea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. These factory cities experienced economic prosperity, attracting more people, and the EIC began forming monopolies and building fortified bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Expansion of Powers Granted by the Crown

Driven by ambitions to gain political power for easier trade and to eliminate competitors, the EIC requested more powers from the English King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Around 1670, King Charles II granted the EIC rights to:
*   Acquire territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   Hold political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
*   Mint money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
*   Oversee civil and criminal jurisdiction in their territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>
*   Maintain a private army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   Form alliances and declare wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

These unprecedented powers allowed the EIC to act as an agent of imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Initial [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Conflict with the Mughal Empire]]

In 1682, the EIC tried to negotiate with Shaista Khan, the Mughal Governor of [[prepartition_history_of_bengal_and_the_role_of_religion | Bengal]], for easier trade and tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. When Emperor Aurangzeb, who considered the EIC arrogant, rejected their petition, the EIC Governor, Josiah Child, declared war on the Mughals in 1686 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This war was a significant blunder for the EIC, as its small army was no match for the powerful Mughal forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The EIC suffered a bitter defeat, with their factories seized and officials arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Josiah Child was forced to apologize to Aurangzeb, who forgave the company but levied a fine of ₹150,000 (equivalent to about ₹350 million today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. EIC's trading privileges and seized factories were restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Decline of the Mughal Empire and EIC's Opportunity

The EIC quietly bided its time, waiting for an opportunity to establish a stronghold in [[prepartition_history_of_bengal_and_the_role_of_religion | Bengal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This opportunity arose with Aurangzeb's death in 1707, which severely weakened the [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Mughal Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Constant power struggles and infighting among the Mughals led to local Nawabs and kings asserting sovereign control over their regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Regional powers like the Marathas, Rajputs, Jats, and Rohillas emerged, with the Maratha Empire expanding its territory northwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Further weakening the Mughals were invasions by the [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the 17th_and_18th_centuries | Persian ruler]] Nadir Shah in 1739 and the [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the 17th_and_18th_centuries | Afghan ruler]] Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Financial problems arose as regional governors stopped paying revenue to the central Mughal government, leading to a decentralized Indian subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Amidst this chaos, the EIC invested in new technologies, set up new factories, and strengthened its private army by recruiting British soldiers and training local Indians known as Sepoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Securing Bengal and European Rivalry

The EIC continued to pressure the Mughal throne for trading privileges in [[prepartition_history_of_bengal_and_the_role_of_religion | Bengal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. In 1717, Emperor Farrukhsiyar granted the EIC tax-free trading rights in Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This royal edict also allowed the EIC to issue a "Dastak," a trade permit that waived all customs and transit duties on its goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This was a major win, as it allowed the EIC to avoid taxes, leading to significant revenue loss for the Mughal Empire and worsening its financial problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

In the same year, Murshid Quli Khan, the Mughal Governor of [[prepartition_history_of_bengal_and_the_role_of_religion | Bengal]], declared Bengal sovereign and himself the Nawab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. He understood the EIC's tactics and ordered them to pay taxes, but EIC officials refused, leading to a decision by the EIC to get involved in local politics to secure its profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

During this period, other [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the_17th_and_18th_centuries | European competitors]] like the Dutch, Danes, and particularly the French, also expanded their influence in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. The French established colonies in Pondicherry and Chandernagore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. By the mid-1700s, the British and French emerged as the two dominant European powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. The existing enmity between France and Britain, evident in wars like the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and the Seven Years' War (1756), spilled over into India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

The Carnatic Wars, fought in Southern India between 1746 and 1763, pitted the British against the French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. England won these wars, diminishing French political influence in India and restricting them to Pondicherry and Chandernagore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Political Interference and Puppet Rulers

Indian rulers, often fighting amongst themselves, observed the superior armies and disciplined officers of the Europeans and began forming alliances with them for military resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. This reliance led to European interference in domestic politics and erosion of Indian rulers' power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. The [[trade_and_political_strategies_of_the_east_india_company | European powers]] would bribe opposition leaders, support them with their armies, and install puppet rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

In 1756, Siraj-ud-Daulah became the new Nawab of [[prepartition_history_of_bengal_and_the_role_of_religion | Bengal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Due to the EIC's continued disrespect for the Nawabs' authority, Siraj-ud-Daulah attacked Fort William in Calcutta, resulting in the "Black Hole Tragedy," where many British officers died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Infuriated, the British, led by Robert Clive, decided to remove Siraj-ud-Daulah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

They allied with Siraj-ud-Daulah's rivals, including the powerful Jagath Seth banking family and his army commander, Mir Jafar, who desired to become Nawab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Siraj-ud-Daulah, aware of these plans, allied with the [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the_17th_and_18th_centuries | French]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The two sides clashed in the Battle of Plassey in June 1757 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Despite having a 15 times larger army, Siraj-ud-Daulah lost due to treachery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The British installed Mir Jafar as the new puppet Nawab of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Siraj-ud-Daulah was assassinated, and French presence in Bengal ended, with Chandernagore coming under British control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The Battle of Plassey marked a turning point, granting the British indirect political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

Mir Jafar, however, proved not to be a compliant puppet and allied with the [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the_17th_and_18th_centuries | Dutch East India Company]] to expel the British <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. The EIC removed him and appointed his son-in-law, Mir Qasim, as Nawab in 1761 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Mir Qasim also resisted British interference and went to war with them in 1763, but was defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. The British reinstated Mir Jafar as Nawab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

Mir Qasim, realizing he couldn't defeat the British alone, formed an alliance with the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daula, and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Their combined forces fought the British in the Battle of Buxar in 1764, but the British again emerged victorious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Direct Rule and Further Expansion

After the Battle of Buxar, the [[trade_and_political_strategies_of_the_east_india_company | East India Company]] decided to end the practice of puppet rulers and assume direct control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. In 1765, the Treaty of Allahabad officially made Robert Clive the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of [[prepartition_history_of_bengal_and_the_role_of_religion | Bengal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. A major point of the treaty was Emperor Shah Alam II's grant of "Diwani Rights" of Bengal to the EIC, meaning all tax revenue from Bengal would go directly to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This officially made the EIC the new ruler of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The EIC's revenue grew exponentially, allowing it to buy more products for trade, strengthen its military, and invest in infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

The EIC employed several techniques to expand its territory across India:
1.  **Residents**: British officials were appointed as diplomats in non-British controlled regions to establish friendly relations with local rulers and subtly interfere in local politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
2.  **Subsidiary Alliance**: The EIC pressured local rulers to enter alliances where they were forbidden from having their own armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The EIC would maintain an army on their behalf, for which the local ruler would pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Failure to pay resulted in the confiscation of territory by the EIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. This technique brought large areas under indirect EIC control, forming what would later be known as the Princely States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Hyderabad was the first state to form a Subsidiary Alliance in 1798 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
3.  **Military Force**: If other techniques failed, the EIC used its military to occupy new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.
4.  **Doctrine of Lapse**: Introduced in 1847 and enforced by Lord Dalhousie between 1848 and 1856, this doctrine stated that if an Indian ruler died without a natural male heir, their kingdom would automatically become part of EIC territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This led to the annexation of cities like Satara (1848), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853), Jhansi (1854), and Awadh (1856) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

The EIC also implemented administrative reforms to regulate its vast territories, such as the Regulating Act of 1773, which created the post of Governor General of Bengal, with Warren Hastings becoming the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. By 1818, the EIC had become the most powerful entity in the subcontinent, controlling about two-thirds of its land and 78% of its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

## End of EIC Rule and the [[british_expansion_and_control_in_india_leading_to_the_british_raj | British Raj]]

The [[trade_and_political_strategies_of_the_east_india_company | EIC's]] rule in India effectively ended after the Revolt of 1857, also known as the First War of Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Although Indian revolutionaries lost, the British government nationalized the EIC under the Government of India Act of 1858 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. All EIC territories, military forces, and wealth were transferred to the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This marked the end of the EIC's rule and the beginning of the [[british_expansion_and_control_in_india_leading_to_the_british_raj | British Raj]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. The company was finally dissolved in 1874 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. The [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Mughal Empire]] also ended after 1857, with the last emperor Bahadur Shah Jafar exiled to Burma and his successors killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

On the evening of May 10th, a ceasefire was announced in the India-Pakistan conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) had called India's DGMO at 3:35 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Both sides agreed to cease all firing and military action from land, air, and sea starting from 5:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, the public first learned about the ceasefire through Donald Trump's social media posts, where he claimed America had mediated the talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Just hours after the agreement, Pakistan reportedly began ceasefire violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The reports on these violations are not yet clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Pakistan's History of Terrorism and Denial

It is considered very difficult to trust the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Government due to their long history of supporting and sponsoring terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Operation Sindoor and Pakistan's Retaliation

India launched [[indias_operation_sindoor_and_military_strategy | Operation Sindoor]] in response to a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, for which Pakistan's terror group TRF (a shadow group of Lashkar-e-Taiba) claimed responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. [[indias_operation_sindoor_and_military_strategy | Operation Sindoor]] involved attacks on nine different terrorist sites in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. These targets were selected based on credible intelligence to avoid damage to civilian infrastructure and lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

In retaliation, Pakistan engaged in unprovoked firing along the Line of Control (LoC) after [[indias_operation_sindoor_and_military_strategy | Operation Sindoor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. They bombarded Indian civilian houses with mortars and shells, particularly in the town of Pooch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. At least 16 people were killed, with 44 out of 59 injured being civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Instances include a shell falling on a car, killing two children aged 14 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, and a bomb hitting a house, killing 12-year-old twins Jain and Zoya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Evidence of State Sponsorship of Terrorism

During [[indias_operation_sindoor_and_military_strategy | Operation Sindoor]], India targeted known terror sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>:
*   **Markaz Taiba in Muridke**: Headquarters of Hafiz Saeed, designated a terrorist by the UN (2008) and with a $1 million US bounty (2012) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. It is the "nerve centre" of Lashkar-e-Taiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Markaz Subhan Allah**: Base of Masood Azhar, added to the UN terrorist list in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This is the headquarters of Jaish-e-Mohammed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Sadna Bilal Camp of Muzaffarabad**: Used to train Lashkar and Jaish recruits, with training provided by Pakistan's Special Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Sawai Nala Camp of Muzaffarabad**: Where terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack were trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   Other sites included initial induction, indoctrination, and training camps for terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

#### Admissions by Pakistani Officials

Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif admitted to Sky News that for the last three decades, Pakistan has been "doing this dirty work for America, for the West and even for Britain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. He stated, "That was a mistake and we suffered for that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan also admitted in March 2019 that jihadist outfits have existed and operated in Pakistan for decades, stemming from the US-led Afghan war against the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. However, he claimed that Pakistan had since closed down all such groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Khawaja Asif similarly denied the current existence of Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Congress leader Shashi Tharoor criticized Pakistan's "master of denial" approach, citing past denials about the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. He emphasized that India's actions were precise and restrained, targeting only known terror sites and avoiding civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

#### Continued Terrorist Activity Post-FATF Delisting

Pakistan was removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in October 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. However, satellite images analyzed by Intel Labs (reported by India Today) show that Jaish-e-Mohammed's base in Bahawalpur has doubled in size since 2011-12, reaching 18 acres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Construction speed increased after Pakistan's FATF delisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The Osman O Ali campus is used for terrorist recruitment and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

A French magazine, *Spectacle Dumon*, reported in December 2024 that Jaish-e-Mohammed has two openly operating hideouts in Bahawalpur (Markaz Subhan Allah and Usman o Ali Mosque), which are indoctrination and training centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. One complex is located just 8km from a Pakistani military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The Print reported in October 2022 that Jaish-e-Mohammed purchased 4 acres of new land to expand its Bahawalpur complex, with the land sold by a local numberdar to Abdul Rauf, brother of Masood Azhar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Abdul Rauf, designated a terrorist by America in 2010 for his role in 2008 India attacks, was seen leading funeral prayers for killed terrorists, with Pakistani military personnel and Pakistan flags on the coffins in the background, implying state funerals for terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Jaish-e-Mohammed's children's magazine, *Muslim Bacche*, advocates for jihad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

A public gathering by Jaish-e-Mohammed in PoK in January 2022 saw them claiming responsibility for the December 2021 Srinagar Police terrorist attack and raising funds for future operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### Financial Support for Terror

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a loan package of $2.3 billion for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. AIMIM leader Owaisi criticized this, calling Pakistan a "threat to humanity" and referring to the IMF as the "International Militant Fund," questioning how the US, Germany, and Japan agreed to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

#### Lashkar-e-Taiba's Narco-Trafficking

India's NIA informed the Supreme Court that Lashkar-e-Taiba used a narco-trafficking strategy to weaken India by selling drugs to its youth and funding terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Over 2900 kg of heroin worth â‚¹21,000 crores seized at Mundra Port in 2021 was part of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Similar consignments from Afghanistan were routed through Delhi warehouses, with proceeds going to Lashkar-e-Taiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. A witness in the 2021 drug seizure case, a retired customs official, was found dead under mysterious circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Lashkar-e-Taiba was formed in 1986 during Zia ul Haq's Islamisation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The UN Security Council has linked it to numerous terror operations, including the December 2001 Indian Parliament attack, July 2006 Mumbai local train blasts, and the 26/11 attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Lashkar terrorist David Headley revealed coordination with Pakistani intelligence officers for the 2008 Mumbai attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Although Lashkar-e-Taiba's charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, was banned by Pakistan in March 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, a 2022 Hudson Institute report states it aligns with the "nationalist Islamist agenda of the Pakistan security establishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. It has been used to implement Pakistan's agenda in Balochistan and even to fight the Islamic State in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

## Impact on Pakistan's Internal Security and Society

Due to its support for terrorism, Pakistan has become highly unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. In the 2024 Global Peace Index, Pakistan ranked 1140 out of 1163 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. The Centre for Research and Security Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank, reported that 2024 was the deadliest year for Pakistan Security Forces in a decade, with 40% more attacks than the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Out of 905 incidents, 444 were Islamist terrorist attacks, resulting in 685 soldiers and police officers killed and 927 civilian deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

Pakistani citizens are being affected by the consequences of this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. The country faces severe internal issues, such as stampedes for free food and flour distribution, with casualties reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. In March 2023, 11 people, including women and children, were killed in a stampede in Karachi during free food distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Another stampede during free flour distribution in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa left one dead and eight injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

Politicians use conflict with India as an excuse to become dictators, undermining the constitution and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. No Pakistani Prime Minister has completed a full five-year term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Imran Khan is currently jailed and reportedly tortured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, and elections are not conducted fairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

Pakistani citizens are urged to question their government and military about why Pakistan is becoming a terrorist nation and why these organizations receive support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

The Apollo 13 mission launched on April 11, 1970, from Kennedy Space Center in America with three astronauts on board, headed for the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This was already the third NASA mission designed to send humans to the moon, coming less than a year after [[apollo_11_moon_landing_recount | Neil Armstrong]] first stepped on the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Initially, the astronauts were very confident in their mission, dreaming of setting foot on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, they were unaware that their dream would never come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Context and Objectives of Apollo 13

In 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy promised to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth before the decade was out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This promise was part of the Cold War "space race" between America and the Soviet Union, vying for leadership in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. With the success of Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 in 1969, Kennedy's promise was fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

However, this success had a side effect: a drastic decrease in [[public_and_governmental_interest_in_space_exploration_postapollo_missions | public and governmental interest]] in funding space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. People were excited for the first moon landing but not as much for subsequent missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. As a result, the American government cut NASA's budget, leading to the cancellation of many planned future missions like Apollo 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Apollo 13 came at a crucial time, as NASA needed to prove its value to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Its primary objective was not just inspecting the moon's soil but also developing human capability to work in the lunar environment, seeking to understand the origin of the moon and Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Spacecraft Design and Crew

The design of Apollo 13's spacecraft was similar to previous missions, consisting of four main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>:
*   **Command Module (CM)**: The main part, a cone-shaped section 11 feet long and 13 feet in diameter, where the three astronauts were seated. It housed instrument panels, navigation gear, radios, life support, and small engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Service Module (SM)**: Contained most of the astronauts' oxygen, additional engines, and fuel cells for electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The CM and SM were collectively known as the Command and Service Module (CSM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. They remained connected until re-entry to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Lunar Module (LM)**: Designed to land on the moon and re-attach to the CSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Launch Escape System (LES)**: Its sole purpose was to protect astronauts during a launch accident by ejecting them safely away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. It was discarded once the launch was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

The spacecraft was launched on a Saturn V rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The crew for Apollo 13 included Commander Jim Lovell, Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, and Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. None of these three were originally chosen for the mission, but replaced others due to various issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

The launch attracted about 200,000 spectators, a relatively small number compared to the 7 million who watched Apollo 11's lift-off, reinforcing NASA's awareness of dwindling public interest in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## [[Challenges and incidents during Apollo 13 | The Problem]]: "Houston, We've Had a Problem"

For the first two days, the mission was smooth, with one minor concern being astronaut Jack Swigert's forgotten income tax return, which he jokingly sought an extension for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Mission control even reported being "bored to tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

On April 13, the third day of the mission, while conducting routine tests on the lunar module and preparing for a television broadcast, a huge explosion occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This happened about 330,000 km from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Commander Lovell reported, "Houston, we've had a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

It was quickly discovered that one oxygen tank was completely empty, and the other was leaking rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The spacecraft had also shifted kilometers off its path every second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Within hours, the astronauts achieved a new record for human distance from Earth, traveling 400,000 km away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The mission objective shifted from landing on the moon to merely surviving the return journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### The Cause of the Explosion

The explosion was traced to oxygen tank number 2 in the service module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This tank was originally installed in Apollo 10 but was removed for modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. During repair, it accidentally fell and was internally damaged, specifically a tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. While testing, the tank would not empty completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. To drain the remaining oxygen, heaters were used to boil it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. However, the thermometer inside the tank could only register up to 30°C, while the temperature actually reached 538°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This extreme heat damaged the insulation of the electrical wires inside the tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Although NASA managers and engineers approved the tank after inspection, they couldn't detect the internal damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. During the routine check on the third day of the mission, these damaged wires caused a spark, leading to the tank's explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Fortunately, the tank was on the exterior, limiting damage to a 13-foot panel on the service module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

## [[Rescue and problemsolving strategies in Apollo 13 | Rescue Efforts]] and Return Journey

With the primary objective of landing on the moon abandoned, the focus shifted entirely to the astronauts' survival. Mission control faced a critical decision regarding the return path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The fastest route would involve rotating the spacecraft and firing the main engine of the service module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. However, this engine was near the blast site, and its integrity was unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

The second option, chosen by NASA's flight director, was to continue towards the moon, circle it, and use its gravity to slingshot back to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This longer route would take 4-5 days and wouldn't require the damaged service module engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The astronauts were instructed to shut down the CSM module and use the lunar module as a "lifeboat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This was a critical decision given the lunar module was designed for only two astronauts for about 20 hours, not three for 4-5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

To conserve supplies and energy, all non-essential systems, including heaters, were shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. The lunar module's engines were fired, or "burned," for the first time to set a new path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This brought them to the far side of the moon, making them the furthest humans from Earth, a record still unbroken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### Carbon Dioxide Problem

A significant [[challenges_and_incidents_during_apollo_13 | challenge]] was the rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The lunar module's lithium hydroxide canisters, which remove CO2, were only sufficient for two people for two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Although the command module had canisters, their square filters did not fit the circular ports of the lunar module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

In 24 hours, ground experts and astronauts collaboratively devised a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Using items like plastic bags, cardboard, suit hoses, and duct tape, they constructed a makeshift device to filter the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Commander Lovell noted in his book, "the contraption wasn't very handsome, but it worked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Astronauts were also severely restricted on water intake (no more than 200 ml per day) to prevent urine output from altering the spacecraft's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This extreme measure led to a total weight loss of 14 kg among the crew and Haise developing a urinary tract infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

After four days, a third burn of the lunar module's engine was required to correct the spacecraft's trajectory due to cooling vapor, a feat remarkable as the module was designed for only one burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Re-entry and Aftermath

The world watched as the astronauts prepared for re-entry into Earth's atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. The astronauts had to return to the command module, as only it was built for re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

Upon entering the atmosphere, a standard communication blackout occurred due to air ionization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This blackout typically lasts 2 to 3 minutes, but for Apollo 13, it extended to 4 minutes and 27 seconds, causing immense suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Finally, communication was re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. All three astronauts survived, deploying parachutes and splashing down safely in the Pacific Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

Despite the mission's failure to land on the moon, Apollo 13 made its mark in history as a testament to teamwork, leadership, and "thinking outside the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. The historical [[rescue_and_problemsolving_strategies_in_apollo_13 | rescue mission]] and the astronauts' bravery led to books and films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Following investigations, NASA adopted many new [[technological_advancements_from_apollo_missions | safety measures]] to prevent similar accidents in future missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

After Apollo 13, Apollo 14, 15, 16, and 17 were all successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Apollo 17, launched on December 7, 1972, was the last mission under the Apollo program, and the last time humans went to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

Despite numerous attempts and plans, the record set by the Burj Khalifa in 2009 remains unbroken more than 13 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. While 17 of the 20 tallest buildings in the world have been constructed since the Burj Khalifa's completion, none have surpassed its height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The Burj Khalifa stands at 829 meters tall, a remarkable 62% taller than the second-tallest building at the time, Taipei 101 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Challenges in Building Supertall Structures

Constructing buildings of immense height presents several significant challenges:

### Structural Integrity and Wind Resistance
A primary concern is ensuring the building can support its own weight and withstand strong winds at high altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. The Burj Khalifa overcame these issues through its [[Innovations and Technologies in Skyscraper Design | innovative design]], featuring a Y-shape with three wings supported by a hexagonal core, known as the Buttressed Core system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This system, invented by structural engineer Bill Baker, helps reduce the impact of strong winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. In contrast, other supertall buildings, like 432 Park Avenue in New York, often require empty floors for winds to pass through if they don't utilize such systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Material Limitations
Current construction materials like concrete, steel, and aluminum have inherent limits on how much weight and stress they can endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. To exceed these limits, new materials that are both lighter and more durable are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Carbon Fibre, a lightweight yet stronger-than-steel material made of woven carbon fibers, is considered a promising option for future taller buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

### Human Physiological Adaptation
As buildings approach heights of 1.5 km to 3 km, differences in air pressure become a concern for human occupants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Rapid elevation changes via elevators could cause symptoms similar to altitude sickness (nausea, dizziness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Maintaining controlled air pressure inside the building would be essential, which would be extremely expensive and potentially restrict features like balconies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Socio-Economic Limitations
The most significant barrier to building ultra-tall structures is financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Investing billions in such projects carries high risks, as there's no guarantee of the same [[Economic and Cultural Impact of tall buildings like Burj Khalifa | economic boom]] and return on investment seen with the Burj Khalifa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Additionally, governmental support is crucial, but many governments may prioritize using funds for other public needs, viewing extremely tall buildings as vanity projects or a waste of public funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. China, for instance, has implemented laws limiting new buildings to 500 meters in height, and 250 meters in cities with populations up to 3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

## Planned and Theoretical Future Projects

Several projects have been proposed to surpass the Burj Khalifa's height, though most face significant hurdles:

### Under Construction/Halted Projects
*   **Merdeka 118 (Kuala Lumpur):** At 679 meters, it is set to be the second-tallest building upon its official inauguration in mid-2023, but it remains significantly shorter than the Burj Khalifa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Jeddah Tower (Saudi Arabia):** Designed by the same architect as the Burj Khalifa, Adrian Smith, this tower aims to exceed 1 km in height, featuring a similar Y-shaped design for structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. [[Construction History of Burj Khalifa | Construction]] began in 2013, but was halted in 2018 due to investor arrests and the COVID-19 pandemic, with no public restart date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Dubai Creek Tower (Dubai):** Planned as an observation tower (similar to the Eiffel Tower, without residential or commercial spaces), its height is speculated to be between 838 meters and 1,300 meters, potentially surpassing Jeddah Tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Its foundation has been laid, but [[Construction History of Burj Khalifa | construction]] is currently stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### Proposed and Theoretical Projects
*   **Mubarak Al-Kabir Tower (Kuwait):** Proposed in 2007 to be 1,001 meters tall with a design similar to the Burj Khalifa, but [[Construction History of Burj Khalifa | construction]] has not yet begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Sky Mile Tower (Tokyo):** A highly ambitious plan for a 1.7 km tall building designed to house 500,000 people, it features large vertical gaps to manage strong winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. This is part of a visionary megacity project called "Next Tokyo," theoretically estimated for completion by 2045 if work begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Cancelled Projects:**
    *   A 1 km tall building planned in Azerbaijan in 2012 was later cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
    *   China's Sky City Scraper, planned for 838 meters in 2013, was cancelled in 2016 due to environmental concerns and lack of government approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Science Fiction Concepts:**
    *   **X-Seed 4000 (Tokyo):** A visionary project from 1995 for a 4 km tall building, taller than Mount Fuji, designed to house 1 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This remains purely a theoretical plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
    *   **Space Elevator:** A theoretical cabled structure intended to reach space for easier transport between Earth and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This concept does not fit the "building" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Practical Limits and the Foreseeable Future

Burj Khalifa's structural engineer, Bill Baker, claims that with a modified Buttressed Core system, buildings could theoretically exceed 2 miles (more than 3 km) in height, possibly even taller than Mount Everest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. However, the practical [[Height Limits and Challenges in Building Skyscrapers | height limits and challenges]] imposed by material science, human physiology, and especially socio-economic factors currently outweigh purely engineering possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

For now and the foreseeable future, the Burj Khalifa is expected to retain its title as the World's Tallest Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Only a limited number of cities globally possess the unique socio-economic conditions (economic boom, high population density, government support, oil wealth) that could justify and enable the construction of such a monumentally expensive and challenging project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

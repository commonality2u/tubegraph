Planetary defense involves strategies to mitigate the threat posed by space objects like asteroids and comets colliding with Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The objective is to prevent a catastrophic event similar to the one that caused the extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Types of Near Earth Objects (NEOs)

Space agencies monitor various celestial bodies that could pose a threat to Earth. These are broadly categorized as [[near_earth_objects_and_risk_management|Near Earth Objects]] (NEOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. NEOs can include asteroids, comets, meteors, meteorites, and meteoroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

*   **Asteroids (Planetoids)**: These are large pieces of rock and metal orbiting in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Their diameters can range from 10-20 meters to 100-200 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Most asteroids are found in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. While the textbook image suggests they are close, the average distance between two asteroids is more than 1 million kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Asteroids typically require telescopes to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Comets**: Made of ice, rocks, and dust, comets are also known as "Dirty Snowballs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. They are found in the Kuiper Belt, beyond Neptune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Comets often have a visible tail when moving in space, which asteroids lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. They can be large, with diameters of 1-10 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, and are visible to the naked eye when they pass by Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Comets are considered more dangerous than asteroids due to their higher speed (twice that of an asteroid) and shorter warning times, potentially appearing suddenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Meteoroids**: These are small pieces of asteroids or comets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Meteors**: When a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere, it becomes a meteor and burns up quickly, appearing as a "shooting star" or a streak of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Meteorites**: If a piece of a meteor survives its journey through the atmosphere and falls to Earth, it is called a meteorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Current and Historical Threats

Throughout history, and even today, space objects have posed a significant threat to Earth.

### Dinosaur Extinction Event
Approximately 66 million years ago, a large impact event led to the extinction of the dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This event highlights the potential for devastating [[impact_of_asteroid_strikes_on_earth|impact of asteroid strikes on Earth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Apophis Asteroid (2029)
The asteroid Apophis, over 1,000 feet in diameter, is scheduled to pass by Earth on April 13, 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, at a close proximity of only 30,000 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This distance is closer than many geostationary satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. It will be visible to the naked eye at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Apophis was discovered in 2004, and initial observations suggested a 2.7% chance of collision in 2029, causing global concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Due to its potential for devastation, it was named after Apophis, the Egyptian god of chaos and destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. However, further observations by scientists confirmed a 0% chance of collision with Earth in 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

Concerns then shifted to potential impacts in 2036 or 2068, as Apophis was expected to pass through a "Keyhole Area" in 2029, where Earth's gravity could alter its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. However, this threat has since been debunked, with NASA confidently stating that the asteroid will not collide with Earth within the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. As a result, Apophis has been removed from the [[near_earth_objects_and_risk_management|Near-Earth Objects]] risk list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### 2038 Asteroid Strike Scare
On social media, posts circulated claiming a 72% chance of an asteroid collision on July 12, 2038, with NASA and ISRO issuing alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Fake News Alert
> News about a 2038 asteroid strike with a 72% collision chance is completely [[2038_fake_asteroid_strike_news|fake news]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

This scenario was part of a hypothetical exercise conducted by NASA to assess planetary preparedness against an asteroid impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The 72% chance was an imaginary parameter set for this mock test, not a real finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Over 100 experts from various organizations, including NASA, the European Space Agency, and the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs, participated in this exercise to plan precise steps to prevent an impact fourteen years out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Chelyabinsk Meteor (2013)
In February 2013, a 20-meter wide meteor exploded above Chelyabinsk, Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This event was not detected by any system in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. The explosion released a powerful shockwave, damaging buildings and injuring nearly 1,500 people, mostly from shattered windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Fortunately, no lives were lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Risk List of Near Earth Objects
Global space agencies maintain a "Risk List" of potentially dangerous asteroids and comets. The European Space Agency's list includes:
*   **2023VD3**: Discovered in 2023, this asteroid is 11-24 meters wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. It has a 0.25% chance (1 in 387) of colliding with Earth on November 8, 2034 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Despite the substantial chance, its small size means it's not very dangerous and would likely fall into an ocean or sparsely populated area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **1979XB**: This larger asteroid, 400-900 meters in diameter, has a negligible chance (0.00002% or 1 in 4.27 million) of impacting Earth on December 12, 2056 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It remains high on the risk list due to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **2008JL3**: With an estimated diameter of 23-50 meters, this asteroid has a 0.01% chance (1 in 6,711) of impact on May 1, 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Detection Systems

Advanced detection systems are crucial for identifying potential threats. There are several [[scientific_detection_projects_for_space_threats|scientific detection projects for space threats]]:

*   **LINEAR (Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research)**: A collaboration between the US Air Force, NASA, and MIT, established in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. It uses two 1-meter and one 0.5-meter telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, discovering over 10,000 objects annually, accounting for 65% of all discovered asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **CSS (Catalina Sky Survey)**: Established by the University of Arizona in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, it uses two large telescopes. Its precision allowed it to find a 4-meter asteroid in 2008 and accurately predict its fall in the North Sudan desert 19 hours later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **PAN STARRS (Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System)**: Located in Hawaii, it uses the world's largest digital cameras (1.4 billion pixels) to find asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System)**: Also in Hawaii, ATLAS serves as a final warning system, scanning the sky twice nightly for undetected asteroids to provide a last-minute impact alert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

In 2028, NASA plans to launch the **Near Earth Object Surveyor** space telescope, stationed outside Earth, to further enhance detection capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

## Defense Strategies

Should a large asteroid be on a collision course with Earth, three main strategies are considered:

### 1. Kinetic Methods
This method involves sending a spacecraft to collide with the asteroid, altering its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. It is the only method successfully tested in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **NASA's DART Mission**: On September 26, 2022, NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully impacted the 170-meter wide Dimorphous asteroid, changing its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This experiment verified the effectiveness of the kinetic impactor technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **China's Plan**: In 2025, China's National Space Agency plans to conduct a similar experiment, colliding a spacecraft with a 30-meter asteroid to change its path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### 2. Slow Push and Pull Methods
These methods gradually change an asteroid's orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. One approach involves sending a spacecraft near the asteroid to concentrate the sun's rays on its surface, vaporizing part of it. The resulting gas release provides a small thrust, gradually shifting the asteroid's orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. A concern is that vaporized rocks could interfere with the spacecraft's optical system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

### 3. Nuclear Methods
This strategy involves sending a spacecraft carrying nuclear bombs to destroy the asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. While seemingly effective, it has significant drawbacks:
*   **Legal and Geopolitical Issues**: Deploying nuclear weapons in space raises numerous international and geopolitical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Fragmentation Risk**: Destroying an asteroid would scatter countless pieces into space, making their trajectories uncontrollable. These fragments could still collide with Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
Despite these issues, the nuclear method remains under consideration for exceptionally large asteroids (e.g., over 10 km, like the one that killed the dinosaurs) where other methods might not be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Preparedness and Future Outlook

The NASA mock test, a Planetary Defense Interagency Tabletop Exercise, found that 81% of participants believed humanity is ready to deal with such a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. However, some gaps were identified, such as the need for more testing of the Kinetic Method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. Previous similar meetings were held in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

For smaller impacts like the Chelyabinsk meteor, a "Civil Defense Component" is crucial. This involves timely international coordination and activation of Disaster Management plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

Overall, the Earth's defense system is strong and becoming more advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Currently, no major asteroids are predicted to have even a 0.01% chance of colliding with Earth in the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Even if a threatening asteroid were discovered, adequate systems are in place to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

The government of North Korea attempts to control nearly every aspect of its citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This includes decisions such as where individuals live, what work they do, and what they study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The extent of this control is so profound that even personal appearance and media consumption are dictated by the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Controlled Appearance

North Korea's government regulates citizens' clothing and hairstyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. There is a list of approved hairstyles, with currently only 15 options for men and 15 for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Notably, Kim Jong Un's haircut is not on this list, and no one else is permitted to have it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Citizens are also prohibited from dyeing their hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, wearing the same glasses as Kim Jong Un <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, or wearing red lipstick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Only minimal makeup is allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

Clothing restrictions include bans on blue jeans, ripped jeans, skinny jeans, branded clothes, tight dresses, short skirts, and sun hats for girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The government views fashion as a "cultural invasion" and fears that liking foreign styles could undermine loyalty to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. To enforce these rules, a "Fashion Police" secretly monitors citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Violators may have their clothes cut, face fines, or even be jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. In 2005, the government even produced a [[propaganda_and_censorship_in_north_korea|propaganda]] series claiming that long hair is unhealthy and reduces intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Restriction of Movement

Citizens require government permission for domestic travel, providing the purpose of their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. International travel is under an even stricter ban, with going abroad without permission considered a traitorous act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Punishment for such an act can include forced labor, torture, life imprisonment, or even death for the entire family, due to the [[guilt_by_association_and_political_prison_camps_in_north_korea|Law of Guilt by Association]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. After the COVID-19 pandemic, border guards were given a "Shoot at Sight" order for anyone attempting to leave or enter the country without permission, leading to 14 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## Control Over Media and Information

Foreign movies and shows are not permitted in North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, and television and radio channels are exclusively government-controlled to support state [[propaganda_and_censorship_in_north_korea|propaganda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Watching foreign media is a serious crime, punishable by severe penalties including hard labor or public execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Despite this, there is a black market for smuggled South Korean dramas, often on USB sticks, which are easier to hide than DVDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. People watch these illicit materials with lights off and windows covered, at barely audible volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Internet access in North Korea is highly restricted and requires government permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. When allowed, a librarian supervises users, and the computer screen freezes every five minutes, requiring the librarian's fingerprint to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Usage is limited to one hour unless further government permission is obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. For common people, there is an expensive internal intranet with only government-selected websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Social media is non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Smartphones sold in North Korea are heavily censored, cannot make international calls, and their operating systems randomly take screenshots that are sent to the government to monitor user activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Only government-approved content is shown, and apps must be downloaded from physical stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

## Religious Suppression

North Korea is an officially atheist country, and practicing or preaching any religion is punishable by death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Christians are particularly targeted, often imprisoned and tortured, as they are seen as influenced by America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

## Cult of Personality and Surveillance

The Kim family, especially Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, are worshipped like gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Their pictures and statues are ubiquitous in homes, offices, schools, and public places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. The secret police regularly inspect homes, and citizens can be prosecuted if these pictures are not displayed or adequately protected, even at risk to their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

The secret police is a pervasive and secretive organization, responsible for human rights violations including disappearances, torture, and [[guilt_by_association_and_political_prison_camps_in_north_korea|imprisonment in political prison camps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. Its agents, spies, and informants are omnipresent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. They force members of the lower Songbun (social class) to spy on each other, fostering deep distrust even within families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. Neighborhood associations, comprised of 30-40 houses, also monitor citizens and encourage spying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. The organization itself is so secretive that even its chiefs' names are unknown to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

## Societal Division and Control

North Korea divides its population into three classes based on political loyalty: Core (loyalists), Wavering (suspected), and Hostile (enemies of the government) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This system, known as Songbun, determines a person's residence, occupation, food rations, healthcare, education, and other facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. Marriages are also influenced by Songbun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. Pyongyang, the capital, is primarily reserved for the "core class," and "Hostile" citizens are not permitted within a 50 km radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. If a family member commits a political crime, the entire family's Songbun class is demoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

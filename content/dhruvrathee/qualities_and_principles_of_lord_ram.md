The inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22nd, 2024, during the [[controversies_around_ram_temple_pran_prathistha_ceremony|Praan Prathistha event]] led to extensive media discussion and various [[controversies_around_ram_temple_pran_prathistha_ceremony|controversies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This event provides an opportunity to reflect on the qualities and principles of Shri Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While discussing Ram is easy, applying his values and principles to one's own life is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Context: Ram Mandir Inauguration and Related Discussions

The Praan Prathistha ceremony, meaning the establishment of life, is the installation of an idol inside a temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The recent ceremony in Ayodhya generated significant public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Non-Attendance at the Ceremony
Several prominent figures and political parties did not attend the inauguration:
*   **BJP Senior Leaders** Despite being key figures in the Ram Mandir Agitation Movement since the 1990s, LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi did not attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The Ram Temple Trust cited their age as the reason for advising them not to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Political Parties**
    *   **CPI(M)** General Secretary Sitaram Yechury declined, stating that religion is a personal matter and the government should not be affiliated with any particular religion, upholding secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   **Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray)** Uddhav Thackeray received an invitation just two days before the event via speed post and rejected it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. His party member Sanjay Raut criticized the BJP, claiming they "rule like [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana|Ravan]]" despite worshipping Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Thackeray instead visited the Kalaram Temple in Nashik on January 22nd, where Lord Rama, Lakshman, and Sita are believed to have stayed during their exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   **Congress Party** Many Congress leaders rejected their invitations, arguing that the temple was still partially incomplete and that the BJP was politicizing the event for electoral gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This stance was seen by some as a good decision and by others as a political blunder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Shankaracharyas' Concerns
All four principal Shankaracharyas, heads of the four Mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya approximately 1,200 years ago, did not attend the ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Ritual Incompleteness** Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati from Puri stated that the ceremony was not in accordance with Hindu scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Incomplete Temple Structure** Shankaracharya Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati from the Uttarakhand Matha explained that the temple is considered the body of God, with its peak as the eyes, the pot as the head, and the flag as the hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. He argued that it is improper to infuse life into a "body" that lacks eyes or a head, as this goes against scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. He therefore could not attend due to these violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Defamation and Misinformation
Following their decision, the Shankaracharyas faced relentless defamation from social media's IT cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **False Accusations of Being "Anti-Hindu"** Fake news spread claiming Shankaracharya Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati had visited Ajmer Sharif <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This was used to label him as anti-Hindu for visiting a Muslim religious site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. However, this news was false; the photo was from a Hindu Ashram, Ramdev Pir's court, considered an avatar of Krishna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The Shankaracharya himself confirmed he had never been to Ajmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. He also noted that even if he had visited a Dargah, it would not imply he became Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Allegations of Bribery** Another baseless fake news story claimed the Shankaracharyas had accepted ₹500,000 to reject the invitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

The speaker highlights that in today's environment, opposing decisions by the BJP or PM Modi often results in defamation and insult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. It is argued that those who certify who is "Hindu" or "anti-Hindu" are not genuinely concerned with Ram's principles, but rather use his name for political purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Qualities and Principles of Shri Ram

The speaker contrasts the idea of a "Great" king, often defined by conquered territories and ruthlessness (like Alexander the Great, who was bloodthirsty and killed hundreds of thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>), with the character of Lord Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Ram's Humility and Composure
When Ram was about to be crowned king, his stepmother Kaikeyi demanded that her son Bharat be king instead, and Ram be exiled for 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Unwavering Calmness** Despite Kaikeyi's harsh words, Ram was neither upset nor angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Valmiki's original Ramayana, Ayodhya Kand, Chapter 18, Shloka 41 states that "Ram was not upset to hear this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Chapter 19, Shloka 1, further notes that he "did not get angry" and was "unruffled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Consoling and Assuring** Ram subsequently consoled his father, Dashratha, and assured Kaikeyi that he would indeed go into exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Contrast with Others** This is in stark contrast to historical figures like Ashok and Aurangzeb, who killed their brothers for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Ram had the support of the people of Ayodhya, who wanted him to be king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. He could have easily declared injustice and taken the throne, even imprisoning Kaikeyi and Bharat, but he chose not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Virtuous Character** Ram's virtuous nature and compassion for everyone are highlighted in Chapter 17, Shloka 15 of the Ramayana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Ram's View on Power and Service
In Chapter 19, Shloka 20, Ram's response to Kaikeyi reveals his perspective on power:
> "O queen, I am not concerned with wealth. I want to be like a sage, abiding in righteousness alone. I want to receive the world hospitable." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>

For Ram, the throne was not about personal power or the world bowing to him; it was about serving the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This contrasts sharply with modern attitudes where people shamelessly admit to being addicted to power and are willing to compromise ethics to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### The True Measure of Victory
Ram's actions provide a profound lesson:
*   **Humility, Compassion, Forgiveness** He harbored no ill feelings towards Kaikeyi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. His only complaint was that she didn't trust him enough to tell him directly what she desired for Bharat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Integrity Over Gain** The speaker prompts reflection: Is one a winner if they abandon all morality and principles for power, or if they relinquish power without compromising their morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>? Losing something while protecting one's morality is not a true loss, whereas gaining something by sacrificing morality is not a true win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

The principles of Shri Ram – humility, compassion, forgiveness, and prioritizing righteousness over power – are timeless values that can guide anyone, regardless of their background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These insights are drawn from Valmiki's original Ramayana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

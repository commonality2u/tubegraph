On June 18, 2023, at 9:30 AM, five individuals embarked on a deep-sea dive in the submersible known as Titan, with the aim of visiting the [[titan_submersible_mission_to_titanic_wreck | wreck of the Titanic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The journey, an extreme form of adventure tourism, cost each passenger over â‚¹20 million for a few hours, due to the extreme depth of the Titanic wreck, located 3,810 meters below the surface of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Disappearance and Search Operation

The Titan began its descent, a journey expected to take approximately two hours to reach the target depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The submersible maintained communication with its support ship, the Polar Prince, by sending signals every 15 minutes, serving as its sole link to the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, after one hour and 45 minutes into the dive, communication ceased abruptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. By 4:30 PM, the scheduled time for its return, the Titan had not resurfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. At 7:10 PM, the Polar Prince team alerted the US Coast Guard, initiating a four-day multinational search and rescue operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The search involved aircraft, ships, and robot vehicles (ROVs) across a vast area of 25,000 square kilometers, which is seven times larger than the Indian state of Goa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. A critical factor was the Titan's limited oxygen supply, estimated to last only 96 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Furthermore, the submersible lacked an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, and its hatch could only be opened from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Despite the challenges, the search pressed on, with sonar systems deployed to detect any underwater signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. On the third day, a Canadian aircraft detected "banging noises" at half-hour intervals, raising hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Discovery and Implosion

On June 22, an ROV located debris on the ocean floor, approximately 490 meters from the Titanic's bow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Subsequent findings of five debris pieces confirmed the submersible had broken apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The US Coast Guard later stated that the previously heard banging noises were unrelated to the Titan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

The conclusion reached was that the Titan experienced a "catastrophic implosion" due to the immense pressure at depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. An implosion is the opposite of an explosion; instead of force moving outwards, it moves inwards, causing an object to collapse due to external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. A "catastrophic implosion" implies the structure was destroyed in less than a millisecond, meaning the passengers died instantaneously without feeling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Design Flaws and Disregard for Safety

The primary reason for the implosion was identified as the [[design_and_materials_of_the_titan_submersible | experimental design of the Titan's hull]], which was made of carbon fiber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Unlike traditional submersibles made of steel, titanium, or aluminum, carbon fiber had not been adequately tested for use at such extreme ocean depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Ocean explorer Robert Ballard, who discovered the Titanic wreck, and filmmaker James Cameron, an experienced deep-sea explorer, both noted the unsuitability of carbon fiber for this application. They observed that the submersible's titanium end caps remained intact, while the carbon fiber main body was found in scattered pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, who was also on board the Titan, had a history of dismissing safety regulations. In a 2019 interview with Smithsonian Magazine, Rush stated that the US Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 "needlessly prioritizing passenger safety over commercial innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. In another interview, he controversially remarked, "At some point, safety is just pure waste... I've broken some rules to make Titan. I think I've broken them with logic and good engineering behind me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

These statements were not isolated. In January 2018, OceanGate's Director of Marine Operations, David Lochridge, raised significant safety concerns about the Titan and even took the company to court when his warnings were ignored. He highlighted the company's unwillingness to invest in proper safety assessments and certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Furthermore, in March 2018, 36 industry leaders, deep-sea explorers, and oceanographers wrote a letter to Stockton Rush, cautioning that his experimental approach and lack of quality checks could lead to a catastrophic accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Another specialist explicitly warned Rush that he was "putting himself and his clients in danger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

The tragedy of the Titan submersible drew parallels to the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] itself, as Rush was accused of repeating the same dangerous overconfidence captured by the phrase "she is unsinkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. The [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | Titan tragedy]] serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of adhering to safety standards and regulations, particularly in high-risk environments like deep-sea exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

Soft drinks have become ubiquitous globally, with Coca-Cola sold in all but two countries: North Korea and Cuba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Coca-Cola alone sells 1.9 billion servings daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This article explores the common ingredients found in these beverages and their potential impacts on [[health_risks_of_soft_drinks | health]].

## Dispelling a Common Myth

One widespread myth suggests that soft drinks are comparable to "toilet cleaners" due to shared acidic components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This comparison is inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Soft drinks contain mild acids like citric acid (found naturally in lemons and oranges) and phosphoric acid (E338), a common food-grade additive that prevents mould and bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, also present in jams, processed meats, and cheeses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. While these acids can also be found in some toilet cleaners, the latter use stronger chemicals such as Sodium Hypochlorite and Hydrochloric Acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The pH level of soft drinks is around 2.5, similar to lemon juice (2.0-2.6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Chemistry is complex, and common constituents do not imply identical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Core Ingredients and Health Concerns

Despite disproving the "toilet cleaner" myth, soft drinks are not considered healthy for regular consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This analysis assumes no unusual contamination like pesticides, which have been reported in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Excessive Sugar Content

A 600ml bottle of Mirinda (a PepsiCo brand) contains 82.8 grams of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, which fills half a glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This translates to 330 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, comparable to two aloo parathas or a masala dosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. These are "empty calories" with no nutritional value, unlike whole foods that provide protein, vitamins, and fiber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The American Heart Association states that the body requires no added sugar to function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Natural sugars from milk (lactose) and fruits (fructose) are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The recommended daily limit for added sugar is 36 grams for adult men and 25 grams for adult women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. A single 600ml bottle of Mirinda significantly exceeds these limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Consistent high sugar intake can lead to various [[impact_of_sugar_on_health_and_alternatives_to_sugary_drinks | health issues]], including:
*   Joint pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   Undue skin ageing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
*   Liver damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   Type 2 diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   Pancreatic breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   Kidney failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   Increased risk of heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>
*   Obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

Sugar is highly addictive, with a 2017 study comparing [[sugar_addiction_comparison_to_drugs | sugar addiction]] to cocaine addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This explains why people often consume sugary drinks or foods regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### [[artificial_sweeteners_and_their_controversies | Artificial Sweeteners]]

Diet soft drinks (e.g., Diet Pepsi, Diet Coke) contain zero calories and zero added sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, using artificial sweeteners like aspartame, saccharin, or sucralose instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. These have a controversial history, with studies linking them to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. A March 2022 French study on 100,000 adults found that aspartame increases cancer risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) also links aspartame to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Other studies connect artificial sweeteners to heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, kidney and liver toxicity, mental health issues, and birth defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Caramel Colour

The dark brown/black colour of Pepsi and Coca-Cola comes from caramel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Caramel is burnt sugar heated with ammonia and sulphites, which produces a byproduct called 4-Methylimidazole (4-MI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Many studies link 4-MI to cancer, and it is listed as a carcinogen in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. In 2012, samples of soft drinks reportedly contained 138 micrograms of 4-MI, more than four times California's permitted limit of 29 micrograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. While Coca-Cola adjusted its formula in America, similar changes were not implemented in countries like India where regulations were lax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Synthetic Food Colours

Drinks like Mirinda and Fanta use synthetic food colour E110, also known as Sunset Yellow FCF, an Azo Dye derived from petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. In 1973, Benjamin Feingold found that artificial food flavours caused hyperactivity and affected children's attention spans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This led to bans in Norway, Finland, and Sweden by 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. A 2007 study linked E110 to attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. By 2010, the European Union required products containing artificial colours to carry a warning label: "it may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Many companies stopped using these colours in the EU, but continued to use them in countries without such regulations, like India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### Preservative E211 (Sodium Benzoate)

E211, or Sodium Benzoate, is a common preservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. In 2005, tests found that soft drinks contained benzene, a carcinogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Benzene forms when benzoate salts (like Sodium Benzoate) react with Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) in the presence of heat and light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Following a controversy and court cases in 2007, Coca-Cola announced it would remove Sodium Benzoate from its products, but this change was primarily implemented in countries where legal battles occurred, not universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Excessive sodium intake can also lead to hypertension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

### Phosphoric Acid (E338)

While not as harmful as other ingredients, large amounts of phosphoric acid (E338) can damage teeth, leading to dental corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Other Ingredients

Soft drinks also contain:
*   **Acidity Regulators**: Such as Citric Acid (E330) for sour taste, and Sodium Citrate (E331) to reduce acidity and prevent oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Stabilizers and Emulsifiers**: Like Starch Sodium Octenyl Succinate (E1450) and Ester Gum (E445), which help combine liquids that don't normally mix and maintain homogeneity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. These are generally not considered dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Carbonated Water**: Water infused with carbon dioxide, which provides the fizz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. All soft drinks are essentially "sugary sodas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Marketing and Alternatives

Major food and beverage companies, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, pledged in 2014 not to market products to children under 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. However, [[misleading_marketing_tactics | indirect marketing]] through sponsored school events and advertisements featuring children continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Some celebrities, like Virat Kohli and Amitabh Bachchan, have stopped endorsing soft drinks due to health concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

Even "fresh fruit juices" and lemonades, while lacking certain chemicals, still contribute to high sugar intake. A single glass of orange juice requires at least six oranges, concentrating natural sugars to unhealthy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

The simplest and healthiest alternative to soft drinks and sugary juices is plain water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Regularly consuming water can lead to a shift in taste preferences, making highly sugary drinks unappealing over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

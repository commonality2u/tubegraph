On March 8, 2014, Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 departed from Kuala Lumpur, destined for Beijing, carrying 227 passengers, 10 flight attendants, and 2 pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The flight's disappearance became the largest aviation mystery in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Flight Details

The flight took off at 12:42 AM on March 8, 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The crew included Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a highly experienced 53-year-old pilot and one of the seniormost captains in Malaysian Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, and First Officer Fariq Hamid, 27, for whom it was a training flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Disappearance

After flying normally for about 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, at 01:08 AM, the flight crossed the Malaysian coastline and reached the South China Sea, heading towards Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Captain Zaharie reported the plane at 35,000 feet, indicating normal operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Approximately 11 minutes later, the aircraft entered Vietnamese Air Traffic jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Kuala Lumpur Air Traffic Control (ATC) radioed MH370 to contact Ho Chi Minh ATC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Captain Zaharie's response, "Good night. MAS 370," was the last communication from the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Only 30 seconds after entering Vietnamese airspace, the plane disappeared from civilian radar at 01:21 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Kuala Lumpur ATC initially believed the plane had simply flown out of their radar range and into Vietnam's airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, Vietnamese ATC observed MH370 enter their airspace but then vanish from their radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. After 18 minutes of unsuccessful attempts to communicate, Vietnamese controllers informed Kuala Lumpur that MH370 had disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Despite standard procedures requiring notification of the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre within an hour, an emergency response only began after four hours had passed, at 06:32 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> – the time MH370 was supposed to land in Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Search Operations

An immediate search operation was launched in the South China Sea, involving 34 ships and 28 aircraft from seven different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. However, no trace of the plane was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Four days later, on March 12, it was revealed that while the plane had disappeared from civilian radar, military radar had tracked it until 02:22 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This military data indicated the plane was last seen near the Andaman and Nicobar islands, west of Malaysia, above the Strait of Malacca, flying north instead of towards Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Satellite Handshakes and the 7th Arc

Further evidence emerged from satellite data, showing that the plane had attempted to automatically communicate with a satellite seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While no location data was transmitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, scientists used the satellite's antenna angle during these "Satellite Handshakes" to estimate the plane's possible location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This created seven large circles, indicating where the plane could have been during each communication attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The last, or 7th, circle was vast, covering areas from Kazakhstan and China to Indonesia and Australia, including a large expanse of ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. By combining this data with the plane's speed and estimated remaining fuel, investigators narrowed the potential crash site to a specific arc within this circle, famously known as the "7th Arc" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This arc is located 2,000 km west of Australia in a largely unexplored part of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Deep Ocean Search and Debris Recovery

Extensive [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search operations]] were conducted along the 7th Arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. By April 2014, surface searches were halted, and deep ocean searches began, becoming the largest and most expensive search operation ever conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. After three years and $160 million, the operation was called off in 2017 without finding the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Despite the failure of the main search, in July 2015, the first piece of debris, a flaperon, was found on Réunion Island, east of Madagascar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In 2018, American company Ocean Infinity signed a "no find, no fee" contract with the Malaysian government to conduct a new search using advanced underwater surveillance vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. During their efforts, they mapped the ocean floor, discovering underwater volcanoes, cliffs, and mountains in the 7th Arc area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, they also failed to locate the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Theories About the Disappearance

Investigations into the plane's disappearance led to several [[theories_about_the_disappearance_of_mh370 | theories about the disappearance of MH370]] regarding what might have occurred:

### Pilot Suicide Theory
This theory accuses Captain Zaharie Shah of intentionally disabling communication and crashing the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Arguments supporting this include:
*   The plane turning 180° back towards Malaysia, which likely required manual, intentional input from the pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   The plane being flown directly above the border between Thailand and Malaysia, possibly to evade both countries' airspace radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   The discovery of a flight simulator at Zaharie Shah's home, on which a path coincidentally similar to MH370's actual flight path was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

However, the official in charge of the search denied this theory, citing that Zaharie was a highly experienced and respected pilot with no family or economic problems, nor any past behavior to suggest such an act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Hijacking/Terrorism Theory
Another theory suggested that hijackers or terrorists were responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Two Iranian passengers traveling with stolen passports were initially under suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. They had used passports stolen in Thailand and were reportedly traveling to Europe via Beijing to settle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. However, this theory was rejected as there was no proof they were terrorists, and Interpol confirmed they were likely not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Oxygen Deprivation/Accident Theory
Considered the most probable theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, this suggests that all passengers and crew, including the pilots, became unconscious due to oxygen deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The plane then continued flying on autopilot until it ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Possible causes for oxygen deficiency include:
*   An electrical fire in the cockpit, disabling systems like the transponder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   A sudden accident leading to oxygen shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   Hijackers intentionally causing oxygen deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

A possible scenario suggests that after entering Vietnamese airspace, pilots noticed malfunctions, turned the plane 180° back towards Malaysia, but then an accident caused oxygen deficiency, leading to unconsciousness. The plane then flew on autopilot, was spotted by military radar, turned south, and continued flying over the Indian Ocean before crashing 2,000 km west of Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### Other Less Likely Theories
Other speculative theories, such as abduction by aliens, the US military shooting down the plane, or the formation of a new [[theories_explaining_bermuda_triangle_disappearances | Bermuda Triangle]], were also floated but are considered unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

## New Developments (2022)

In 2022, retired aerospace engineer Richard Godfrey claimed to have found the secret to the mystery using radio wave technologies, specifically a system called WSPRnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Godfrey combined data from the British Inmarsat Satellite, Boeing figures, Australian oceanographers, and the new WSPRnet amateur radio wave technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

### WSPRnet Technology
This [[new_technology_and_methods_in_locating_mh370 | new technology and methods in locating MH370]] uses reflections of radio waves to predict airplane paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. A computer program recognizes flight paths by detecting weak signals from radio waves reflected by aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

According to Godfrey's calculations, MH370 lies precisely on the 7th Arc, approximately 4 km underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, an area previously searched but potentially missed due to underwater terrain like cliffs and volcanoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. He has pinpointed the location with an accuracy of 40 nautical miles and proposed a new, smaller [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search operation]] within this radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

### Drift Analysis
A drift analysis, which models ocean currents to predict where debris from a crash might travel, supports Richard's findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This analysis indicates that pieces of the plane would have reached Madagascar and surrounding islands, consistent with the 27 pieces of debris already found on various islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

Despite some criticism of his methodology, Richard Godfrey believes a new search operation could locate the plane by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. The hope remains that this new analysis may finally uncover the mystery of MH370.

The [[atomic_bombings_of_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] represented a pivotal moment in history, demonstrating the devastating power of nuclear weapons for the first time in warfare. The development of these weapons was part of the Manhattan Project, led by J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Development of the Bombs

The creation of the atomic bombs involved extensive research into nuclear fission, specifically focusing on Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Two types of atomic bombs were developed:
*   **Little Boy** The first bomb, named Little Boy, was based on Uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> and utilized a gun-type design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. In this design, two sub-critical masses of Uranium-235 were rapidly combined to reach a critical mass, triggering a fission chain reaction and explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   **Fat Man** The second bomb, named Fat Man, used Plutonium-239 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a> and featured a more complex implosion method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This method involved placing a sub-critical mass of plutonium inside a hollow sphere and using external explosives to create an implosion, compressing the plutonium to critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

Prior to their deployment, the implosion method was tested in the Trinity Test, codenamed Gadget, on July 16, 1945, in the New Mexico desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This test bomb, containing 13 pounds of plutonium, was detonated at 5:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. The blast was significantly more powerful than anticipated, estimated at 15-20 kilotons of TNT, fifty times more dangerous than Oppenheimer's expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. It evaporated a steel tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a> and created a radioactive green glass called Trinitite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## The Bombings

Less than a month after the Trinity test, the Little Boy bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Three days later, the plutonium Fat Man bomb was dropped on Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Reactions and Aftermath

The [[impact_of_hiroshima_and_nagasaki_bombings_on_japan | impact of Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings on Japan]] was catastrophic, leading to millions of lives lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The broader effects of these bombings are discussed in detail in other videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Key figures reacted strongly to the bombings:
*   **J. Robert Oppenheimer** Upon witnessing the Trinity test, Oppenheimer famously quoted a line from the Bhagavad Gita: "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. He initially expressed happiness after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, having wished it could be used against Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. However, he was shocked when the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Oppenheimer later sought to ban nuclear weapons, expressing regret for his role in their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. He regarded the Hiroshima bombing as a "necessary evil" but feared the future proliferation of this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. In a meeting with President Harry Truman, Oppenheimer stated, "I have blood on my hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
*   **Albert Einstein** His first reaction to the news was "Woe is me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. He is also believed to have said, "Mankind invented the atomic bomb, but no mouse would ever construct a mousetrap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **President Harry Truman** The President was angered by Oppenheimer's remorse, telling his secretary to remove him from the office and never see his face again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

Oppenheimer later worked with the US Atomic Energy Commission to advocate for control over nuclear weapons and prevent further attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. He strongly opposed President Truman's idea of creating a hydrogen bomb in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, but the U.S. developed and tested one in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Despite the development of more nuclear weapons, no other nuclear weapon has been used in the 80 years since the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

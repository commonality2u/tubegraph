Recent observations in India reveal extreme levels of political devotion, leading to actions like a man performing a religious ritual with his own blood for PM Modi's victory and even building a temple for him at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Some individuals express readiness to pay exorbitant prices for essential goods like cooking gas and petrol if it means the Modi government remains in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Even when challenged to list a single achievement of the BJP, supporters are unable to do so, yet remain committed to voting for Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This level of uncritical support, even in the face of personal hardship or a lack of tangible achievements, is attributed to the [[WhatsApp and media brainwashing tactics | brainwashing]] of millions of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## The Rise of WhatsApp University

The primary force behind this widespread [[WhatsApp and media brainwashing tactics | brainwashing]] is identified as "WhatsApp University" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. While traditional pro-government media and YouTubers contribute, [[WhatsApp misinformation and its impact on society | WhatsApp]] plays the largest role due to its unique characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Lack of Accountability
Unlike mainstream media, which faces police cases and FIRs for spreading misinformation, individuals and groups propagating lies on WhatsApp are largely immune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Aman Chopra (News18):** Faced FIRs for spreading fake news about a temple demolition in Rajasthan, falsely linking it to a mosque demolition and the Congress government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Fact-checks revealed the temple was demolished under BJP municipality rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Arnab Goswami (Republic TV):** An FIR was filed against him for falsely claiming that sadhus lynched in Palghar were killed by Muslims, when the arrested individuals were not Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Amish Devgan (News18):** Faced an FIR and Supreme Court trial for using derogatory language against Sufi saint Khawaja Moinuddin, later claiming it was a slip of the tongue for Alauddin Khilji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Sudhir Chaudhary (Zee News):** Faced an FIR for promoting a false WhatsApp flowchart about different types of 'Jih@d' on his TV program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

These examples illustrate how [[Impact of political influence on media | pro-government anchors]] attempt to spread hatred and defend government policies, but are constrained by the fear of legal repercussions and fact-checking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. In contrast, [[WhatsApp misinformation and its impact on society | WhatsApp messages]] are forwarded anonymously, making it nearly impossible to trace the source and file FIRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. While governments can theoretically track and take action (as seen in a Karnataka lynching case where a WhatsApp group admin was arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>), the problem persists because the "WhatsApp m@fia" is reportedly run by the BJP IT cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### The BJP IT Cell's Role
A Singapore news channel documentary revealed an employee of the BJP IT cell stating their team's main task is to defame others in comment sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. High-ranking officials like PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have actively promoted false narratives. For instance, PM Modi endorsed the fake propaganda film "The Kerala Story," which falsely claimed 32,000 Hindu and Christian girls from Kerala joined ISIS, a number later admitted by filmmakers to be made up (the real figure was 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Amit Shah also boasted about the BJP IT cell's ability to circulate any message, true or false, to 3.2 million WhatsApp groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This highlights how the government itself enables the [[WhatsApp misinformation and its impact on society | WhatsApp misinformation]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## The Four Departments of Brainwashing
The "WhatsApp m@fia" operates through four main departments, primarily targeting Hindus, as a means to control the majority community, mirroring historical [[Propaganda techniques in media | dictatorial strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This approach aligns with the ideologies of figures like Savarkar and Golwalkar, who were self-declared admirers of H and sought to exclude Muslims and Christians while promoting casteist texts like Manusmriti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### 1. Racial or Religious Pride
The initial phase involves instilling pride in one's race or religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Messages emphasize the greatness of Hindu history and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This department avoids genuine scientific or historical figures like Aryabhatta or Rishi Charak, instead focusing on religious and mythological narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. It pushes pseudo-scientific claims, such as:
*   Vedas containing cures for Coronavirus and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   Hawan (ritual burning) producing oxygen and cleaning the atmosphere (claiming 10 grams of cow ghee produces a tonne of oxygen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   Cows exhaling oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
*   Wearing toe rings having health benefits related to nerves, uterus, and fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   Applying tilak pressing the trigeminal nerve to clear sinuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

These claims are often baseless, contradictory to basic science, or misrepresent religious texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. The objective is to encourage people to "switch off their brains" and accept messages without critical thinking or verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Individuals who debunk these lies are often labeled "anti-Hindu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

### 2. Victimisation and Self-Pity
Once pride is established, the narrative shifts to making the target feel like a victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Messages assert that Hindus have been "tortured for centuries" and prevented from succeeding for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### 3. "You Are In Danger"
Following victimisation, constant false messages are spread to instill fear, claiming that Hindus are currently in danger from "other religions" and that anti-BJP entities like Congress, AAP, Left-wing, and even international agencies are against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This creates a pervasive sense of threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### 4. Modi's Cult of Personality
The final stage presents PM Modi as the sole savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. [[The role of misinformation in political support for PM Modi | WhatsApp messages]] elevate Modi beyond human status, portraying him as an incarnation of Krishna or Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Before [[Election strategies and brainwashing tactics | elections]], this department becomes highly active, urging votes for BJP to "save Hindus," despite real-world issues like inflation, unemployment, or democratic concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Historical Parallels: Hitler's Propaganda
This four-step process for [[Propaganda techniques in media | brainwashing]] the majority community echoes the tactics used by H in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
1.  **Racial Pride:** German Aryans were told they were the greatest and purest race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
2.  **Victimisation:** Germans were presented as victims of economic collapse and other problems caused by "Js" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
3.  **Threat:** The "Js" were portrayed as an existential danger that would destroy the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
4.  **Savior Figure:** H was presented as the "Supreme Leader" and "God incarnate" who would save them from all troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
These historical [[Propaganda techniques in media | propaganda techniques]] are now being replicated through [[WhatsApp and media brainwashing tactics | WhatsApp]] to achieve similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Countering the WhatsApp Mafia
The constant bombardment of [[WhatsApp misinformation and its impact on society | WhatsApp messages]] following this chronology keeps individuals in a state of "mental slavery," making them ignore real-world issues and blindly support a particular political figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. To combat this [[Media bias and misinformation in Indian politics | misinformation]] and protect democracy, collective action is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>:
1.  Join the author's WhatsApp channel to receive factual messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
2.  Forward these factual messages to hundreds of contacts daily to counter the volume of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
3.  Download the "Dhruv Rathee app" as a backup in case YouTube or WhatsApp channels are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.
4.  Create and upload short 1-minute videos debunking lies on social media platforms using the hashtag #Mission100Crore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.
5.  Crucially, exercise the right to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

The goal is to reach all one billion voters in the country to protect the Constitution and democracy, and free people from mental slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

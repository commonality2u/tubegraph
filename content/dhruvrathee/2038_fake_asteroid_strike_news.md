Reports circulated online in 2024, claiming that an asteroid had a 72% chance of colliding with Earth on July 12, 2038 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. These reports suggested that NASA had issued an alert and begun [[Planetary Defense Strategies | planetary defense exercises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Some posts even incorrectly stated that the ISRO Chief had warned of impending extinction and that migrating to Mars was an option being considered by global space agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Debunking the Claims

The news regarding a 2038 asteroid strike was entirely fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The "72% chance" was not a scientific finding or result, but rather a hypothetical scenario created by NASA for a mock exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### The NASA Hypothetical Exercise
NASA conducted a hypothetical exercise to assess Earth's preparedness against a potential asteroid impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The scenario imagined discovering an asteroid today that was projected to collide with Earth in July 2038 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This mock test involved over 100 experts from various organizations, including NASA, the European Space Agency, the UK Space Agency, and the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. They discussed the exact steps to prevent such a collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. A report on this exercise was released publicly by NASA on June 20, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

This was the fifth such meeting, with previous ones held in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2022. These sessions, known as the Planetary Defense Interagency Tabletop Exercise, bring together experts to simulate responses to asteroid threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

### Media Misinformation
The false news primarily spread through social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Even mainstream news websites sometimes published misleading "click-bait headlines," such as one from the Times of India that stated, "NASA warns that a planet-sized asteroid has a 72% chance of impacting the earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. However, the articles themselves often clarified in their opening lines that this was a hypothetical exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This highlights issues with [[fake_news_in_indian_media | Indian media standards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Current Assessment of Asteroid Threats

Contrary to the fake news, there are no large asteroids with even a 0.01% chance of colliding with Earth in the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### Real Asteroid Risk Lists
Space agencies maintain "Risk Lists" of potentially dangerous [[Near Earth Objects and Risk Management | Near Earth Objects]] (NEOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. These lists detail possible collision dates, probabilities, and asteroid diameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The [[2029 Apophis Asteroid | Apophis asteroid]], over 1,000 feet in diameter, will pass within 30,000 km of Earth on April 13, 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. While initially, there was a 2.7% chance of collision for 2029, further observations confirmed a 0% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. NASA has confidently stated that Apophis will not collide with Earth in the next 100 years and has removed it from the Near-Earth Objects risk list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Planetary Defense Capabilities
Earth's defense systems are continuously advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Detection Projects**: Projects like LINEAR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, PAN-STARRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, and ATLAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a> are dedicated to detecting NEOs. In 2028, NASA plans to launch the Near Earth Object Surveyor space telescope to further enhance detection capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **Deflection Strategies**: If an asteroid were to pose a threat, several [[Planetary Defense Strategies | strategies]] are in place:
    *   **Kinetic Impactor Method**: This involves crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid to alter its orbit. This method was successfully tested by NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission on the Dimorphous asteroid in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
    *   **Slow Push and Pull Methods**: These methods involve gradually changing an asteroid's orbit, for example, by using concentrated solar energy to vaporize a portion of the asteroid, creating a small thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
    *   **Nuclear Method**: As a last resort, this method involves detonating a nuclear bomb near or on an asteroid to destroy or deflect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. This method has significant legal and geopolitical challenges and risks fragmenting the asteroid into uncontrollable pieces, but remains an option for extremely large threats, such as those comparable to the asteroid that caused the [[extinction of dinosaurs due to asteroid impact | extinction of dinosaurs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

The general consensus among experts, as demonstrated in the mock exercises, is that humanity is largely ready to deal with such threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

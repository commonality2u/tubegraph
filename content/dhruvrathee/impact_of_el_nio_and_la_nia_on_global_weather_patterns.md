The world has experienced a series of unprecedented heat records in recent years. The summer of 2022 was dubbed the "Hottest Summer Ever," with India breaking a 122-year-old temperature record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This was surpassed by the summer of 2023, which scientists declared the hottest in the last 2,000 years for the Northern Hemisphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This trend continued into 2024, with January, February, March, and April all setting new records for the hottest recorded months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The last 11 months globally have been record-breaking in terms of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

This scorching heat is not normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Last month, South India and the entirety of [[extreme_heatwaves_and_recordbreaking_temperatures_in_india_and_southeast_asia | Southeast Asia]] experienced [[extreme_heatwaves_and_recordbreaking_temperatures_in_india_and_southeast_asia | record-breaking heat waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Countries like Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia reported unbearable temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, with the Philippines' heat index crossing 53°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Forest fires also occurred in Uttarakhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. While global warming and climate change are significant factors, they are not the only reasons for these extreme weather events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## El Niño: A Major Driver of Extreme Weather

The primary natural weather event behind much of this global destruction is El Niño <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It is a natural cycle of the Earth's climate that typically occurs every 5-7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, though [[impact_of_climate_change_on_marine_life | climate change]] is making it more extreme year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Its full name is El Niño Southern Oscillation, or ENSO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. According to the World Health Organization, ENSO is the second biggest cause of Earth's climate changes, after the Earth's relationship with the Sun and its revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### How El Niño Works

El Niño manifests in the Pacific Ocean, the world's largest and deepest ocean, situated between Asia and the Americas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Normally, winds known as Trade Winds blow from east to west across the Pacific, from the Americas towards Asia and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This is due to the Coriolis effect, as Earth rotates from West to East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. These winds push the warm surface water towards the west (towards Australia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. In the east (near South America), colder, nutrient-rich water from the depths rises to the surface in a process called Upwelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This cold water supports marine life and keeps South America cooler, while the warm water near Australia leads to more evaporation and rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

During an El Niño event, these Trade Winds weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This weakening leads to:
*   Weak or non-existent Upwelling in the east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Warm surface water remaining consistently hot across the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   Rainfall patterns shifting, causing the Australia region to become very dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

El Niño events typically last for 6 to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Impacts of El Niño

*   **Australia and [[extreme_heatwaves_and_recordbreaking_temperatures_in_india_and_southeast_asia | Southeast Asia]]**: Higher temperatures, drier weather conditions, and increased risk of [[extreme_heatwaves_and_recordbreaking_temperatures_in_india_and_southeast_asia | heat waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The violent Australian wildfires of 2020 were caused by El Niño <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **South America**: The opposite effect, with increased rainfall and a higher risk of floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Devastating floods in Brazil, displacing over 150,000 people, were a direct consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Southern Africa**: Severe droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. In 2024, a drought unparalleled since 1947 led southern African countries to request $5.5 billion to prevent starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **India**: El Niño significantly impacts India's monsoon, leading to less rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This was a major reason for the hot summers in 2023 and 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Other Regions**: The heavy rains and floods in Dubai were also partly caused by El Niño <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Scientists believe that human-caused [[impact_of_climate_change_on_marine_life | climate change]] is making the El Niño effect more extreme, leading to more dangerous floods and violent [[extreme_heatwaves_and_recordbreaking_temperatures_in_india_and_southeast_asia | heat waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## La Niña: El Niño's Counterpart

La Niña is the opposite phenomenon to El Niño. Both terms are Spanish, meaning "the boy" (El Niño) and "the girl" (La Niña) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. La Niña occurs when the normal conditions of the Pacific Ocean go to extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### How La Niña Works

During a La Niña event:
*   The Trade Winds blowing towards the west strengthen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   This pushes colder water towards South America and hotter water even more strongly towards Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   As a result, Australia experiences increased rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

La Niña events usually last longer than El Niño, from 1 to 4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. For example, the La Niña from 2020-21 became so extreme it caused flooding in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Recent El Niño and La Niña Events

An illustrative chart of El Niño (red peaks) and La Niña (blue trenches) events over the last 30 years shows their varying intensities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   The strongest El Niño event recorded was in 2015-16, followed by 1997-98 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   The current El Niño event began in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, and scientists predict it will subside, with La Niña potentially starting by July-August 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   The last El Niño event before the current one was from 2018-19, lasting until January 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   The latest La Niña event was from 2020-21, extending to January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The strongest La Niña before that was in 1999-2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

The predicted return of La Niña in 2024 could mean a better-than-average monsoon season for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Understanding Heat: Temperature vs. Heat Index

When discussing heat, it's crucial to understand that temperature alone isn't always the most useful metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Humidity plays a significant role in how heat feels and affects the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Hot air can hold more moisture than cold air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. When humidity increases, it becomes harder for our bodies to evaporate sweat, which is our primary cooling mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This can be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

The **Heat Index** (also known as "Feels Like" or "Real Feel" temperature) combines both temperature and humidity to indicate how hot the weather truly feels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. For example, 35°C with 50% relative humidity can feel like 41°C, but with 75% relative humidity, it can feel like a dangerous 53°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, putting one at high risk of heat stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This is why the recent [[extreme_heatwaves_and_recordbreaking_temperatures_in_india_and_southeast_asia | heat wave]] in the Philippines was so dangerous, as its heat index reached 53°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## The Urban Heat Island Effect

Beyond global climate patterns like ENSO, local factors can significantly increase heat impact. The **Urban Heat Island Effect** explains why some areas within a city are significantly hotter than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Areas with dense concrete buildings, glass structures, and asphalt roads absorb sunlight and retain heat throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Lack of proper ventilation and air circulation exacerbates this, causing the absorbed heat to be released at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

Studies in Delhi found that "Urban Heat Islands" like Connaught Place were 3°C to 8°C hotter than areas with more trees, such as Hauz Khas District Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This highlights the crucial role of greenery in urban cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

## Local Solutions for Heat Mitigation

Addressing the impact of extreme heat requires local-level solutions:
*   **Greenery**: Planting more trees and creating more parks in cities can significantly reduce temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Cities should prioritize walkable spaces and greenery over extensive road networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Reduced Car Usage**: Cars release heat, contributing to the Urban Heat Island effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Promoting public transport, cycling, and car-free zones (as seen in Paris) can help lower urban temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Building Design**:
    *   **Natural Ventilation**: Buildings should be designed to maximize natural airflow and minimize the need for air conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, drawing inspiration from historical architectural practices that incorporated ventilation towers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
    *   **Cool Roofs**: Painting roofs white reflects sunlight instead of absorbing it, potentially reducing indoor temperatures by 2°C to 3°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. Planting greenery on roofs is another alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
    *   **Radiant Cooling**: This modern (but historically inspired) technology involves circulating cold water through pipes in walls to cool buildings without relying on energy-intensive ACs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This not only keeps buildings cooler but also reduces electricity bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

These solutions must be implemented urgently, as [[extreme_heatwaves_and_recordbreaking_temperatures_in_india_and_southeast_asia | heat waves]] are projected to become more dangerous and impactful in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. A study on Future Projections for the Tropical Indian Ocean indicates that by 2050, many areas could experience almost permanent [[impact_of_climate_change_on_marine_life | marine heat waves]], lasting 220 to 250 days a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

The role of media in holding the government accountable has seen a significant shift, particularly in India. Historically, the media was more willing to scrutinize government actions, but a discernible change has occurred, leading to accusations of a lack of courage and a focus on propaganda.

## Historical Context: Pre-2014 Scrutiny

Before 2014, the media in India was perceived to have more courage in questioning the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This extended to films, such as *A Wednesday*, which openly questioned the government's handling of terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Public outrage also played a role, with protests leading to the resignation of politicians who accepted responsibility for failures. For example, after the 26/11 Mumbai attack, then Home Minister Shivraj Patil and Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh resigned due to public demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This was considered a basic function of a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## The Shift in "New India": Lack of Accountability

In what is referred to as "New India," the media is accused of lacking the courage to question the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This shift is characterized by a reluctance to scrutinize government actions, even in the face of significant security failures.

### Specific Examples of Media Behavior

*   **Arnab Goswami's Stance**: Prominent anchor Arnab Goswami publicly blamed the Supreme Court for security issues related to Article 370, stating that judges "will not take responsibility for the security situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This is despite his leaked WhatsApp chats showing him celebrating the Pulwama attack coverage as a "win like crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Suppression of Critical Reporting**: Pro-government media anchors are described as unable to ask simple questions, such as why there was no proper security at a tourist spot where a terror attack occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. An instance is cited where an Aaj Tak correspondent attempting to highlight the lack of police presence at a picnic spot was stopped mid-sentence with loud music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Ignoring Key Issues**: The pro-government media reportedly ignored the 300-day strike by Kashmiri Pandits over security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. They also do not report on the deployment of highly trained NSG commandos, funded by taxpayers, for the security of billionaires and Bollywood celebrities like Mukesh Ambani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Consequences of Unquestioning Media

The lack of critical questioning by the media has several implications:

*   **Presenting Failures as Achievements**: Pro-government media is criticized for presenting government failures as achievements, such as depicting the Prime Minister's actions after an attack as "Angry Modi" whose "Order Shocked the World" and "Gave the Army a Free Rein" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This contributes to a "brainwashed" public living in a "world where the earth revolves around Modi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. This impacts the [[impact_of_political_influence_on_media | political environment]] and the [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | shaping of public opinion]].
*   **Erosion of Accountability**: When the media fails to ask critical questions, it reduces the government's incentive to find solutions to pressing issues like preventing terror attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Propaganda and Division

The media's role has extended to the active promotion of divisive narratives:

*   **Spreading Religious Hatred**: The BJP's official social media handles have been accused of using tragic events, such as the Pahalgam attack, to spread religious hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. An example cited is a post from BJP Chhattisgarh with the caption: "They asked for the religion not the caste," "We'll remember" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. A journalist from India Today satirically commented that "it is never too soon to use a tragedy for one's benefit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. This highlights the [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | use of propaganda techniques]].
*   **Fomenting Fear for Votes**: This strategy is seen as an attempt to create fear among Hindus about Muslims, and vice-versa, to secure votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Narratives such as "Hindus in perpetual danger" and claims of a rapidly increasing Muslim population compared to a decreasing Hindu population have been pushed since 2014, which were not heard before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   **Fueling Discord**: Such actions sow discord between Hindus and Muslims, aiming to break apart the country and lead it towards civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Ignoring Internal Issues**: The focus on religious division distracts from addressing caste-based discrimination, as acknowledging such problems would require finding solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

The overall [[role_of_media_politicians_and_public_response_in_controversies | role of media, politicians and public response in controversies]] has shifted significantly, with concerns about the [[government_suppression_of_dissent_and_media | government suppression of dissent and media]] and a growing focus on divisive narratives rather than critical oversight.

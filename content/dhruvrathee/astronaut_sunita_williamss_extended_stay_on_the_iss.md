On June 5, 2024, at 10:52 AM, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft was launched from America, carrying two experienced NASA astronauts: Commander Barry E. Wilmore and Pilot Sunita Williams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Their destination was a short trip to the International Space Station (ISS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The mission, officially named the Boeing Crew Flight Test, was the final step to test the capabilities of the [[boeing_starliner_spacecraft_mission_issues | Boeing Starliner spacecraft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

After 27 hours, on June 6, 2024, at 1:34 PM, the spacecraft successfully docked with the ISS, and both astronauts entered the space station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This successful docking made Boeing the world's second private company, after SpaceX, to make and fly a human orbital spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Historically, only Russia, the USA, and China have achieved this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

However, the celebration was short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The Starliner mission was intended to last only 8 days, with the astronauts returning to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. As of the video's publication, even after three months, both astronauts remained stuck in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Due to multiple problems with the spacecraft, it cannot be used for their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] anticipates the astronauts will remain on the ISS for approximately 8 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Astronaut Safety and Life on the ISS

Despite being unable to return immediately, the astronauts are not in danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The International Space Station is over 350 feet long and can accommodate many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Its living and working space is larger than a 6-bedroom house, with sleeping areas for 6 people, two bathrooms, a gym, and a 360Â° view bay window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

The ISS is well-equipped for long-term stays:
*   **Oxygen** It has its own oxygen-generating system through water electrolysis and also recycles exhaled oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Water** An excellent recycling system converts urine into drinking water and captures moisture from breath and sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Food** The ISS maintains a 6-month food reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Crew members rotate every 5-6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams have become part of Expeditions 71 and 72, conducting research and experiments with the other astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Expedition 71 is currently researching space botany, fluid shifts, algae-based life support systems, and neuro-degenerative diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Both astronauts are highly experienced:
*   **Barry Wilmore** is 61 years old and had previously spent 178 days in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Sunita Williams** is 58 years old, of Indian origin (like [[impact_of_kalpana_chawla_on_science_education_in_india | Kalpana Chawla]]), and had spent 322 days in space before this mission, having been part of Expeditions 14, 15, 32, and 33, and commanded Expedition 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Initially, clothing was a concern as they only carried clothes for 8 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. However, [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] sent a shipment of their personal belongings on August 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Problems with the Starliner Spacecraft

The [[boeing_starliner_spacecraft_mission_issues | Boeing Starliner spacecraft]], formally known as Cruise Space Transportation-100 Starliner (CST-100 Spaceliner), is an orbital spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Orbital spacecraft are launched at high velocities (over 28,000 km/h) to reach and orbit Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, distinguishing them from suborbital spacecraft that merely reach the edge of space before returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Only SpaceX and Boeing, along with China, Russia, and the USA, have developed human orbital spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. India's Gaganyaan mission aims to achieve this as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

[[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] began its Commercial Crew Program in 2011 to collaborate with private companies, selecting SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. SpaceX's Crew-1 flight in November 2020 was a success with their Crew Dragon spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The Starliner's crew module can seat 7 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

The root of the current problem lies with the Starliner's thrusters, which are crucial for flight and maneuvering, and the helium leaks that power them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Launch Delays and Helium Leaks
*   **May 6, 2024 (Original Launch Date)**: The launch was stopped 2 hours before countdown due to a faulty pressure valve in the Atlas V rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **June 1, 2024**: Another attempt was canceled 4 minutes before launch by a computer abort system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **June 5, 2024 (Actual Launch)**: Before this launch, engineers were managing a helium leak caused by a defective seal, which was deemed manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. However, a few hours after launch, two more leaks were discovered, followed by a fourth helium leak when the Starliner reached the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The Commercial Crew Program Manager of Boeing admitted they did not understand the root cause, indicating a major systematic problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Thruster Malfunctions
Hours before docking, 5 of the 28 thrusters on the Starliner were not working properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Commander Barry Wilmore had to manually control the spacecraft, working with ground engineers to reset and refire the thrusters. Four out of five thrusters started working again, allowing the Starliner to successfully dock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] stated this failure was a data issue, not hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

Post-docking, hot fire tests revealed the thrusters were overheating when exposed to direct sunlight on the capsule's manual control system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Without sunlight, they operated normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Due to uncertainty about recurrence, [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] decided the Starliner would return to Earth without the astronauts, prioritizing safety and avoiding a repeat of disasters like the [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | 2003 Challenger disaster]] which involved [[impact_of_kalpana_chawla_on_science_education_in_india | Kalpana Chawla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Astronauts' Return Plan

Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore are now scheduled to return to Earth using [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | SpaceX]]'s Crew Dragon spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | SpaceX]] Crew-9 mission will go to the ISS in February 2025, sending only two astronauts instead of four, allowing the stranded astronauts to return with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This means the two astronauts will spend approximately 9 months in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Boeing's Track Record in Space and Aviation

Despite [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]]'s Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich calling Starliner a "very capable spacecraft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, its development has faced significant issues:
*   **Orbital Flight Test (OFT-1) - December 20, 2019**: This uncrewed test, carrying the doll Rosie the Rocketeer (similar to India's Vyomitra), aimed to dock with the ISS and return after 8 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. However, it was aborted after two days as Starliner could not dock with the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Investigation revealed thruster issues due to computer system miscalibration of timing, and [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] admitted insufficient oversight of Boeing's software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2) - May 19, 2022**: This second uncrewed test was successful, with Rosie the Rocketeer reaching the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. However, even in this test, some thrusters did not operate properly, mirroring the problem seen in the Crew Flight Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

Notably, when [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] awarded contracts in 2014, Boeing's contract was worth $4.2 billion, significantly more than [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | SpaceX]]'s $2.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Today, [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | SpaceX]] is attempting pioneering missions like the world's first private spacewalk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

Boeing's problems extend beyond space to its aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The company has faced criticism for its 737 MAX commercial airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>:
*   **January 5, 2024**: A Boeing 737 MAX of Alaska Airlines experienced a door breaking apart mid-flight at 16,000 feet, causing rapid decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Investigations revealed loose hardware, specifically bolts needing additional tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **2018 (Lion Air Flight 610) & 2019 (Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302)**: Two fatal crashes of 737 MAX planes were linked to a problematic software that in some cases took control away from pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. These incidents led to the grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX planes for 20 months until December 2020 after safety enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

The CEO of Boeing has announced his resignation by the end of 2024 amidst these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

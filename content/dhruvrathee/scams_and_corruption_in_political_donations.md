The speaker asserts that citizens have been robbed of their money due to what is possibly the biggest scam in the history of independent India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This is described not as a single event but as a collection of scams, and the largest extortion racket in the country, linked to the [[Electoral Bond Scam | Electoral Bond Scam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The "Tenders and Kickbacks" Model
The essence of this scam can be summarized as: "You give me kickbacks, I will give you business opportunities, and if you don't give me kickbacks, I will trap you with ED's mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This model, where [[Influence of Political Donations on Government Contracts | tenders and kickbacks]] are exchanged, is now supported by direct evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Introduction of Electoral Bonds
The Modi government introduced the Electoral Bonds Scheme in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The scheme was announced by then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. A key feature was that every action under this scheme would be hidden from the masses, preventing citizens from knowing which companies paid what amounts to which parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Concerns were raised at the time that this would lead to a major financial scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A video from March 22, 2017, explicitly stated that "Corruption became legal in India" as companies would not need to reveal their political funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This lack of [[Transparency and Accountability in Political Funding | transparency]] was central to the problem.

## Supreme Court's Intervention
After seven years, the Supreme Court declared the Electoral Bonds Scheme unconstitutional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, leading to the gradual revelation of scams that occurred during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The petition against the scheme was filed by the CPI(M) political party and NGOs Common Cause and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), with Advocate Prashant Bhushan arguing on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

The Supreme Court highlighted two significant points:
1.  Citizens have the right to know the quantum and source of donations given to political parties, and the scheme went against the citizen's right to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
2.  The court expressed concern that the scheme was used to get [[Influence of Political Donations on Government Contracts | kickbacks]], stating that contributions could be classified as "purely business transactions" where companies donate to get benefits in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

The Court directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to release the data, which was published on the Election Commission's website within two days after initial delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Unveiling the Lies and Data
Home Minister Amit Shah falsely claimed at the India Today conclave that total bonds sold were worth ₹200 billion, with BJP receiving only ₹60 billion, implying ₹140 billion went elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. However, ECI data shows the total bonds encashed between April 2019 and January 2024 were ₹127 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Political Party Donations (April 2019 - January 2024):
*   BJP: ₹60 billion (approximately 47.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
*   Trinamool Congress: ₹16 billion (12.6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Congress: ₹14 billion (approximately 11.1%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   BRS: ₹12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   BJD: ₹7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
*   DMK: ₹6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   YSR: ₹3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   TDP: ₹2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
*   Shiv Sena: ₹1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
*   Other parties (RJD, AAP, JDS, SKM, NCP): ₹300-700 million each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

BJP politicians often justify their high receipts by claiming the party is national with many MPs and MLAs, and that their "money received per MP" ratio is lower than other parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Defining the Scam
Simply giving or receiving [[Corporate funding and political donations | political donations]] is not inherently a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. However, it becomes a scam or fraud if donations are exchanged for contracts, if public tax money is used to pay donors, or if companies not donating are harassed by agencies like the ED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The problem with BJP's donations, according to the speaker, is that they created a vast extortion racket, shattered democratic principles, and stole public funds to get these "donations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Media outlets like ANI, Dainik Jagran, and India Today were criticized for publishing Amit Shah's false claims without fact-checking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, contributing to [[Accusations of political affiliations and bias | accusations of being government's puppet media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## How Electoral Bonds Worked
An electoral bond functioned like a coupon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. A company paid a bank to buy these coupons, which were then given to political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Political parties could then redeem the coupons for money from the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. If a bond was not encashed within 15 days, the money would be transferred to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## The Revelation of Secret Numbers and Government's Knowledge
Journalist Poonam Agarwal bought two electoral bonds in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Though the bonds showed no buyer's name or identifying details, forensic testing revealed each bond had a secret Unique Alphanumeric Number visible only under ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This contradicted the Modi government's claim that donor identities would remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The Finance Ministry later acknowledged these secret numbers but claimed they were only a security feature and not for tracking donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also reassured opposition parties that donor identities would not be revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

However, an RTI filed by retired Navy Officer Lokesh Batra and records reviewed by HuffPost India showed that SBI *did* record serial numbers for audit trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Furthermore, a January 2018 notification stated that SBI had to provide electoral bond details to any law enforcement agency upon request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This meant that agencies like ED or CBI could easily ascertain which company donated which Electoral Bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

This revealed three critical implications:
1.  The public was kept unaware of who made [[Corporate funding and political donations | political donations]] and how much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
2.  Opposition political parties were unaware of which companies donated to the BJP and in what amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
3.  The BJP government had access to all information about donating companies, becoming a secret weapon against the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Key Actors in the Frauds
The frauds involve three entities:
1.  **The Political Party in Power**: This can be the central government or a state government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
2.  **Large Companies**: Those making [[Corporate funding and political donations | political donations]] through electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
3.  **The Common Masses/Public**: Whose public funds (taxes) are at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The scam involves the government taking money from the public's box, putting it in a company's box (e.g., through contracts), and in return, the company takes money from its box and puts it into the party's box via electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This is contrasted with a "Robin Hood" scenario, as the common masses were robbed to benefit the rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Examples of Scams and Corruption

### 1. Tax Evasion and Extortion
Companies not paying taxes means reduced public funds, impacting government services and salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Instead of raiding such companies, a deal is made: [[Corporate funding and political donations | political donations]] are given in exchange for the government not taking action on tax evasion and allowing illegal activities to continue, with agencies like ED remaining quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This is described as extortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, leading Congress politician Rahul Gandhi to call PM Modi "Vasuli Bhai" (someone who runs an extortion racket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Several top donor companies, including Future Gaming, Megha Engineering, and Vedanta, were raided by ED and Income Tax Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. A Quint analysis found that 14 out of the top 30 donors had been raided by agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### 2. Compromised Public Projects and Quid Pro Quo
The government should award contracts for public projects based on criteria like experience, performance, technical capability, and financial position to ensure quality and fair pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. However, this was often disregarded.

*   **Navayuga Engineering Company Limited**: This company was awarded the contract to build the tunnel in Uttarakhand that collapsed, trapping 41 workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Between 2019 and 2022, it bought electoral bonds worth ₹550 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Ranjit Buildcon**: An under-construction flyover built by this company fell in Ahmedabad in December 2021, the third such incident for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Inquiry revealed compromised quality of concrete and construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Despite this, it received multiple projects from Gujarat's civic bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Between January and July 2023, it bought electoral bonds worth ₹90 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **BG Shirke Construction Private Limited**: This Pune-based company purchased electoral bonds worth ₹1.18 billion between January 2023 and January 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. An FIR was registered against it in June 2022 for causing death by negligence after four people died in an elevator crash at its housing project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Previously, in October 2018, four people died at its construction site after falling from a tower crane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. The speaker points out that political parties do not care about human life as long as they get their share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Megha Engineering**: Between 2019 and 2023, this company bought electoral bonds worth ₹9.66 billion, with associated companies increasing the total to over ₹12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
    *   **Kaleshwaram Multipurpose Irrigation Project (Telangana)**: Inaugurated in June 2019, its estimated cost ballooned from ₹810 billion to over ₹14.7 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. A CAG report revealed Megha Engineering was overpaid by ₹51.80 billion for four packages, and combined with other contractors like L&T and Navayuga Engineering, undue benefits amounted to at least ₹75 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Projects worth ₹250 billion were awarded before detailed project reports were received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. The National Green Tribunal deemed the environmental clearance for this project illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
    *   **Zojila Tunnel (connecting Srinagar and Leh)**: In August 2020, Megha Engineering, a "small company from Hyderabad," was awarded this ₹45 billion contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
    *   **Thane-Borivali Twin Tunnel (Mumbai)**: Megha Engineering purchased ₹1.4 billion in electoral bonds in April 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. The next month, May 2023, it was awarded this ₹144 billion project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
    *   Despite being raided by the Income Tax Department in October 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, Megha Engineering continued to buy billions in electoral bonds and received projects from both the Telangana state government and the central Modi government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. In June 2023, the Defence Ministry awarded it a ₹5 billion project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

## Other Noteworthy Cases (to be detailed in subsequent discussions)
*   **Future Gaming**: A lottery company that was raided by central agencies while the Finance Minister was meeting the "Lottery King's son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   **Beef Exporting Companies**: These companies bought [[Political Donations by Pharma Companies | Electoral Bonds]] to donate to parties, which is presented as a wake-up call for religiously affiliated voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **Mining Giants (Vedanta, EMIL, GHCL, MSPL)**: Accused of bending environmental rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Qwik Supply Chain**: A company with directors also in Mukesh Ambani's Reliance, which bought electoral bonds worth more than its net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

This detailed evidence is presented as just the "tip of the iceberg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

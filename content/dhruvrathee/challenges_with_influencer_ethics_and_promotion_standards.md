The digital landscape has given rise to influencers who wield significant sway over public perception and behavior. However, this influence comes with a [[social_responsibility_among_influencers | social responsibility]], and many challenges arise when influencers prioritize profit and fame over ethical conduct, leading to the spread of misinformation, promotion of harmful products, and the erosion of societal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Unethical Influencer Practices

A significant challenge in the influencer space is the prevalence of unethical practices, often driven by a desire for views and financial gain. One prominent example cited is Elvish Yadav, whose daily activities include using vile language, beating people, spreading hatred, abusing intoxicants, getting youth addicted to betting, and objectifying girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Such influencers often operate under the belief that "even bad publicity is good publicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Key issues highlighted include:
*   **Spreading misinformation and lies**: Influencers like Elvish Yadav have been accused of fabricating claims, such as sharing false information about others sharing pornographic content in Telegram groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Promoting harmful products**: Despite large sums offered (e.g., up to â‚¹2 million), some influencers promote addictive and harmful products like betting and gambling apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, which can lead to financial ruin and mental distress for young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Instances of promoting scam cryptocurrencies have also been noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This highlights the issue of [[paid_social_media_trends_and_fake_pr | paid social media trends and fake PR]].
*   **Misogyny and objectification**: Some influencers engage in misogynistic behavior, such as calling women "witches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>, objectifying salesgirls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>, and glamorizing the objectification of women in their content and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Promoting intoxicants and violence**: Influencers have been seen promoting the consumption of intoxicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a> and engaging in violence, such as slapping and beating others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.
*   **Exploiting religious sentiments**: Some influencers use religious symbols or phrases for commercial gain, even distorting religious scriptures on merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. They may also mock religious mantras or sacred texts in their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Spreading hatred and political propaganda**: Influencers are observed using their platforms to spread hatred, declaring others "anti-national" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, and exhibiting selective outrage based on communal biases rather than universal principles of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. This can involve misrepresenting political affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a> or engaging in hero-worship of political figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This has a direct [[impact_of_political_influence_on_media | impact of political influence on media]].
*   **Lack of transparency and accountability**: Some influencers do not disclose their full team size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> or the motivations behind their content, claiming personal passion when actions align with political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Ethical Standards in Content Creation

In contrast to the aforementioned practices, some content creators adhere to strict ethical guidelines for their promotions and content:
*   **Refusal of harmful promotions**: Ethical influencers refuse to promote betting/gambling apps, tobacco products, Chinese companies, or fast food/soft drink companies due to their harmful impact on youth and public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Due diligence in endorsements**: Before accepting promotions, ethical content creators attempt to verify the legitimacy of companies, asking for details about investors and affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Recognizing human fallibility, they are willing to remove ads and set new standards if issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Promoting positive values**: Instead of spreading hatred or misogyny, ethical content creators aim to bring positive change to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. They advocate for Indian unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a> and universal justice, regardless of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Setting a good example**: These creators strive to be a positive influence on their followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> and encourage other influencers to adopt similar high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Impact and Call for Change

The actions of unethical influencers have a significant [[celebrity_influence_on_public_perception_and_behavior | celebrity influence on public perception and behavior]], especially on young audiences. The speaker views such individuals as a "threat to our society and our country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

To address these challenges, a call for specific actions has been made for problematic influencers:
1.  **Stop spreading hatred**: Remove content that promotes genocidal characters and instead promote Indian unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
2.  **Cease promoting harmful apps**: Stop endorsing betting apps that addict youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
3.  **Remove offensive content**: Delete or edit out videos that disrespect religious figures or scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.
4.  **Redesign misleading merchandise**: Update products that distort religious texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.
5.  **Delete videos promoting intoxicants**: Remove content that encourages drug use among youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.
6.  **Eliminate misogynistic content**: Delete videos that attack women's dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

8.  **Encourage respectful communication**: Ask their followers to stop using abusive language towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
9.  **Create positive songs**: Focus on creating positive contributions to culture instead of glamorizing violence or objectifying women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
10. **Avoid criminal behavior**: Refrain from violence, threats, and illegal activities like money laundering, to avoid legal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

These recommendations underscore the urgent need for influencers to embrace greater [[personal_philosophies_and_influence_of_media | personal philosophies and influence of media]] and ethical standards, recognizing their profound [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | influence of media on social behavior and norms]].

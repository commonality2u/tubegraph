Singapore's approach to education and skill development has been a cornerstone of its [[economic_development_of_singapore | development]] since its independence. [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]], the country's first Prime Minister, quickly prioritized education as a means to foster national growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Focus on Foundational Education
A key aspect of Singapore's educational philosophy is the emphasis on high-quality, accessible public education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The government maintains excellent schools and colleges with impressive infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Primary education is compulsory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, and public education is available at nominal, almost free, fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Vocational Training and Skill Development
Recognizing the importance of practical skills for a developed nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, Singapore has heavily focused on vocational training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This includes ensuring Singaporeans learn skills in technical schools and through internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

To support the workforce's continuous upgrading, a monthly Skills Development Levy is mandated by law for employers to pay for their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This levy contributes to the Skills Development Fund, which supports various workforce upgrading programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### Impact on Industries
Through robust skill development initiatives, Singapore transformed its economy by the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. It became a significant part of global supply chains for sophisticated technologies, including:
*   Biotech engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>
*   Aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>
*   Integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>
*   Pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>
*   Petroleum chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>
*   Semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>

This strategic focus on providing quality [[educational_infrastructure_and_opportunities | education]] and useful skills enabled citizens to work in industries that did not rely on natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

## Promoting Unity and Harmony
Beyond academic and vocational skills, Singapore's education system also plays a crucial role in fostering [[singapores_ethnic_diversity_and_integration_policies | ethnic diversity and integration policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Principles of secularism, diversity, and unity are upheld and taught to children from the school level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This includes initiatives like Racial Harmony Day, where on July 21st each year, students dress in traditional costumes of other religions and read the Declaration of Religious Harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

In the contemporary world, understanding [[Role of Religion in Society | religion]] and its scriptures is deemed necessary because [[Role of Religion in Society | religion]] is often exploited by politicians and media to spread fear and hatred among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Promoting education about diverse faiths can foster understanding, love, and brotherhood among individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Contextual Interpretation of Calls for Violence
[[Religious Scriptural Stories and Myths | Religious scriptures]] across various faiths contain passages that, when read out of context, appear to endorse violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. However, these lines are heavily contextual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Quran:** Surah 9, Verse 5, which states "Kill the Mushrik, meaning disbelievers, wherever you find them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   **Hebrew Bible:** Book 1 Samuel, Chapter 15, conveying God's message to Saul to "attack the Amalekites, and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Christianity]]: Gospel of Matthew Chapter 10 Verses 34-36, where Jesus tells his disciples, "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Bhagavad Gita:** Chapter 2, Shloka 31 to 38, where Lord Krishna advises Arjun, "Happy are the Kshatriyas, the warriors to whom such fighting opportunities come unsought, opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

These calls for violence are explained within specific contexts:
*   Lord Krishna's advice to Arjun is in the context of the Mahabharata war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   Prophet Muhammad's instructions to his followers are in the context of the conflict with the Quraysh tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   The line from Jesus is interpreted as having a [[Metaphorical and literal interpretations of the Ramayana | metaphorical meaning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

No scripture explicitly states that one should kill innocent people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Terrorists and orthodox individuals within every religion deliberately misinterpret these scriptures to promote violence and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This deliberate [[Misinterpretations and later additions to the Ramayana | misinterpretation]] often involves presenting texts out of context or even fabricating Sanskrit verses to spread misinformation via channels like WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

For instance, Islamic scholars like Wahiduddin Khan, who received India's Padma Vibhushan award, teach that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Conversely, figures like Osama Bin Laden brainwash people by claiming Islam commands killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Similarly, genuine Hinduism scholars teach love and affection, while malicious individuals misrepresent verses from the Gita to incite violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

## Interpretations of Idol Worship
Different [[Religious Scriptural Stories and Myths | religious traditions]] hold varying views on idol worship, often leading to [[Religious and castebased tensions in India | tension]] and [[Political exploitation of religious tensions in India | political exploitation]].

### Abrahamic Religions and Idols
*   **Judaism and Islam:** Do not worship idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This stance is rooted in stories like that of Abram (later Abraham), who broke idols as a challenge to polytheism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
    *   The Hebrew Bible (Exodus Chapter 20, verses 4-5) forbids making idols of *other things* and bowing down before them, not idols of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
    *   In fact, God himself commands Prophet Moses to make statues (e.g., Cherub on the mercy seat) through which He would speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Similarly, the Temple of Jerusalem had carvings of cherub and palm trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
    *   The Quran (Surah 4, Ayat 48) warns against associating partners with God, meaning not worshipping anyone other than God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Another type of idol worship mentioned is idolizing property, wealth, or one's own desires and ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

*   [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Christianity]]: Does not consider the use of images to be wrong, which is why idols of Jesus and Mary are found in many churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Hindu Interpretation of Idols
Hindus do not worship idols themselves, but worship God *through* the idol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The idol serves as a means to connect with the formless divine, similar to remembering a father by looking at his photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The physical idol is not worshipped as God itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Acharya Prashanth explains:
> "The idol has been a successful experiment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> The idol has been a good means to reach the formless. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a> And when the idol is worshipped, it is never said that the idol is the true God. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> It is said that I will use this idol to reach the true God. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> I will use the idol to reach the formless." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>

Hinduism also contains warnings against idolizing ego, material desires, or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. It also features mentions of monotheism, such as in Rigveda Mandal 1, Shlok 46, and Yajurveda Chapter 32, which describe the one God by many names and as the creator of all beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

## Defining "Kafir" and Its Misuse
The Arabic word "Kafir" means "disbelief" (`Kufr`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, and "Kafir" is one who disbelieves in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. While atheists are generally considered Kafirs in Islam, [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Judaism]], and [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Christianity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, it is a wrong notion to say that all Muslims consider all non-Muslims to be Kafirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

The meaning of "Islam" is "Submission before God," and "Muslim" means "one who submits before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. From a liberal Muslim perspective, any person who believes in any religion and worships God, irrespective of the name given to God, is considered a Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

The Quran (Chapter 2, Verse 62) counts Jews, Christians, and Sabians among believers, indicating that those who believe in God are not considered Kafirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The conflict mentioned in the Quran is specifically with those who believe an idol to be God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## Common Themes in Religious Narratives
Despite apparent differences, fundamental similarities exist across religions, particularly in their narratives and core tenets. For example, the concept of monotheism—believing in one God—is often associated with Prophet Abraham, a common figure in [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Christianity]], [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Islam]], and [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Judaism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. These three are classified as Abrahamic religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Another striking similarity is the story of a great flood that wiped out humanity, with a chosen individual saving life on an ark or boat:
*   **Noah's Ark (Abrahamic Religions):** Noah (or Nuh) is warned by God of an impending flood and builds an ark to save his family and pairs of all living creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **King Manu (Hinduism):** King Manu is saved by Matsya (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) who warns him of a great flood and instructs him to build a boat for all living creatures, plants, and Saptarishis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Epic of Gilgamesh (Mesopotamia):** The sage Utnapishtim is warned of a great flood and saves his relatives, living creatures, and food in a huge boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Greek Mythology:** Deucalion and his wife build a boat to escape a great flood caused by Zeus, after being warned by Prometheus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

These deep similarities demonstrate how fundamentally alike many religions are, aligning on core principles despite superficial differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

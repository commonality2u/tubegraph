Deep sea mining poses a pressing short-term threat to [[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | deep sea creatures]] and the ocean ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

## What is Deep Sea Mining?

Deep sea mining involves sending large machines to dig in the deep seas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. The primary motivation for this activity is to extract valuable minerals such as gold and silver, often found near hydrothermal vents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This process leads to large-scale destruction of the deep-sea ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. As of the transcript's recording, deep sea mining has not been implemented anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, and no country has yet received permission for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

## Impact on Marine Life

A prime example of a creature threatened by deep sea mining is the Scaly-Foot Snail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. This unique snail, whose legs are made of iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, lives on the deep sea floor near hydrothermal vents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. It possesses a heart that accounts for 4% of its body volume, making it the creature with the largest heart relative to its body size in the entire animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Mining companies are specifically targeting areas where this snail has been found, aiming to exploit the gold and silver deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

The overall impact of deep sea mining is disastrous for both animals and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

## Political Advocacy and Opposition

Some politicians, such as Donald Trump, are criticized for brainwashing followers by denying [[impact_of_climate_change_on_marine_life | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. These figures are also accused of promoting deep sea mining to benefit "crony capitalist friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. The Modi government, for instance, has been reported to be planning to permit deep sea mining near Kerala, India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, despite local protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

The United Nations' International Seabed Authority holds the power to grant permission for deep sea mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Despite no country having received permission yet, there is immense pressure on this organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>, and it is speculated that permissions might be granted soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

Opposition to deep sea mining is growing:
*   Many NGOs and activists have raised their voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   About 32 countries have openly declared they will not support deep sea mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   Greenpeace has initiated a petition titled "Stop Deep Sea Mining Before It Starts," which has gathered over 3 million signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
*   Numerous organizations have formed the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition to protect these creatures and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

This is considered a "once in a generation" opportunity to prevent the destruction of the deep sea, unlike land-based mining that has already caused significant damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

## Early Life and Introduction to RSS

Narendra Modi's childhood and early education indicate an average student who enjoyed acting in school plays, often refusing roles if he wasn't given the main part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. He studied at Bhagavatacharya Narayanacharya School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

At the age of 8, in 1958, he became a child volunteer in the Vadnagar's RSS branch on Diwali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. His school classmate, Sudhir Joshi, noted that after school, he would drop off his books and go to the RSS office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Rise Through RSS and BJP

In 1972, at the age of 22, Narendra Modi became a Pracharak in RSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Fifteen years later, in 1987, he was brought into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, recognized as an "amazing organiser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

During the 1990 Ram Rath Yatra, Narendra Modi, then part of the Gujarat BJP, played a key role in organizing the Gujarat portion of the Yatra, as noted by Andy Marino in his political biography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. In 1995, he was appointed as the National Secretary of BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Chief Minister of Gujarat

Narendra Modi was appointed as the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. The 2002 riots occurred shortly after his appointment, leading to accusations against him, though he eventually received a clean chit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Following these events, the branding of him as "Communal Narendra Modi" began, portraying him as an unwavering Hindu against all Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Public Image and Political Expediency

Modi's [[narendra_modis_public_image_and_psychological_profile | public image]] often appears contradictory. While some perceive him as communal, others view him as secular and committed to development for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. He has been observed to adapt his stance based on political needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>:

*   **Communal Rhetoric**: Despite making speeches about "mutton and fish" during Sawaan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, he takes donations from Halal Beef Exporting Companies via electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. He has also used speeches to incite hatred against Muslims, for instance, in Rajasthan, calling them "intruders" who "have more kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Secular Stances**: In Bihar, he presented himself as a peace messenger, stating he would not allow the country to be divided on religious lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. In an interview on May 14, he claimed he would cease to be fit for public life if he used Hindu-Muslim rhetoric for politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. He tweeted "Secularism is in our blood" in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Religious and Community Ties**: He has declared old relationships with various communities depending on the context, including Sikhs (wearing a turban and serving langar in Gurudwaras) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>, Lord Buddha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, Bohra Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>, Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>, and tribals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

### [[criticisms_of_modis_claims_and_portrayal | Criticisms of Claims and Portrayal]]

His claims of connection often lack factual basis. For example, he stated he saw the Kolkata Metro as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, but the metro began operations in 1984 when he was 34 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. He also expressed a desire to be reborn in Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a> and promises to make various states India's #1 state based on where he is campaigning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

### Abandoned Initiatives and Rhetoric

Several initiatives and slogans from his tenure are no longer promoted:
*   **Demonetisation**: Once hailed as a surgical strike against black money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>, it is not used to ask for votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.
*   **Farm Laws**: Initially promoted as a historic achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>, their repeal, although called a "masterstroke" by pro-government media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>, is not campaigned upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. The promise to double farmers' income has also faded from discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.
*   **Anti-Corruption**: The slogan "Neither be corrupt, nor allow others to be" and the claim that Parliament would be "as pure as the River Ganga" are no longer heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: Despite previously criticizing the then-Prime Minister for not addressing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>, his government does not campaign on controlling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
*   **Flagship Programs**: Initiatives like Make in India, Made in India, Adarsh Gaon, Smart City, Bullet Train, Skill India, and Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao are largely absent from current election posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

Modi has not held a single press conference or unscripted interview in 10 years, avoiding open debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

## Consolidation of Power: The Reward-Punishment System

A key aspect of Narendra Modi's political strategy involves a "reward-punishment model" to consolidate power and ensure loyalty across various institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.

### Sidelining Opponents

Historian Harbans Mukhia compared Modi to Aurangzeb, noting his skill in knowing "whom to get close to and whom to sideline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Political Rivals**: Ousting Shankar Singh Vaghela and Keshubhai Patel within the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. He isolated Lal Krishna Advani after initially aligning with him against Atal Bihari Vajpayee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. Jaswant Singh did not receive a ticket in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. Murli Manohar Joshi was sidelined in 2014 and asked to rest in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.
*   **Cabinet Ministers**: Sushma Swaraj was kept away from key foreign policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. Rajnath Singh, despite being senior, was dropped from several cabinet committees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. Nitin Gadkari was dropped from the BJP's Parliamentary Board after praising Jawaharlal Nehru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Judiciary**: Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh was prematurely retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi was given a Rajya Sabha seat four months after retirement, following Supreme Court judgments favoring the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa was removed after refusing to give a clean chit on Narendra Modi's hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.

### Promoting Loyalists

Loyalty to Modi appears to be the primary criterion for advancement, regardless of other qualifications:
*   **Political Appointments**: S. Jaishankar was directly posted as Foreign Secretary and later became External Affairs Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. Nirmala Sitharaman, who joined BJP in 2006, became Defence Minister in 2017 and Finance Minister in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. Smriti Irani, despite losing elections, was appointed HRD Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>. Ashwini Vaishnav was given three ministries within two years of being selected for Rajya Sabha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. Jyotiraditya Scindia became a Rajya Sabha MP and Aviation Minister shortly after defecting from Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. Of 25 politicians accused of corruption who joined BJP, 23 have been cleared of charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Sports Institutions**: Lokesh Chandra, who called Modi "God," was appointed head of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. Pahlaj Nihalani was appointed CBFC chairman after his "Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi" statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>. Gajendra Chauhan, who campaigned for Modi, was appointed Chairman of FTII Pune despite a lack of relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. Jay Shah, Amit Shah's son, became head of BCCI despite no apparent cricket qualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.
*   **Media and Influencers**: Pro-government media outlets receive advertisements and interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. The National Creators Award was introduced, with many recipients being Modi loyalists and praisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>. Modi invites "Super150 influencers" to his home, including those known for using "filthy language" and following Twitter trolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>.

## [[narendra_modis_image_and_cult_of_personality | Image and Cult of Personality]]

Modi has been observed to display self-obsession and a desire for absolute control over his [[narendra_modis_image_and_cult_of_personality | public image]].
*   **Self-Promotion**: The Motera Stadium was renamed after him, with its ends named after his friends Ambani and Adani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>. He has been seen pushing people out of the camera frame to ensure his prominence in photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>. At the Ram Mandir inauguration, he was the sole prominent figure, unlike the Akshardham temple inauguration which featured multiple leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>.
*   **Dominance in Public Spaces**: His photos and quotes are displayed prominently at historical sites like Gandhi Darshan Museum, sometimes overshadowing Gandhi himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>. His image appears on Olympic medalists' posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>, government schemes (Namo Kisan Samman Diwas), roads, and hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>. His photo is printed on free food bags and COVID vaccine certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Branding**: He participates in various photoshoots, including with ducks, feeding a peacock, exercising, at the beach, in a gym, and on safari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>.

Prashant Kishore suggested that the BJP seeks not just votes but "full control of your mind" and desires worship, aiming for "psychological dominance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.

## Psychological Assessment

Psychologist Ashis Nandy, who interviewed Narendra Modi in 1996, was "shaken to his core" by what he found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Nandy concluded that Modi falls under the diagnostic category of a "F@scist," exhibiting traits of an authoritarian personality:
*   Puritanical Rigidity (strict adherence to moral or religious codes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>
*   Constricted emotional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>
*   Fear of one's own passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>
*   A huge ego that hides insecurity, leading to a desire to control everything outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>

This analysis suggests a leader driven by a "greed and hunger for power," who suppresses criticism by labeling critics as "traitors," a characteristic of dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>.

World War I, a conflict that lasted four years and resulted in over 20 million deaths, was not triggered by a single incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While the [[assassination_of_archduke_franz_ferdinand | assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] acted as a spark, the war was the culmination of a "long and complex chain of reasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is often compared to a matchstick igniting a mountain of dynamite; the blast was not solely due to the matchstick, but because of the underlying volatile conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## European Landscape in 1914

In 1914, Europe was dominated by large empires: the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire (in present-day Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The United Kingdom and France were also prominent powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Most European countries at this time were monarchies, with only France, Switzerland, and San Marino being democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The Balkan Countries, including Serbia, Bosnia, Romania, and Bulgaria, played a crucial role in the lead-up to the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Annexation of Bosnia and Rising Tensions

The story leading to the war begins in 1878 with a war between the Russian and Ottoman Empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Russia supported the Balkan countries in their separation from the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The Treaty of Berlin, signed in 1878, granted the Austro-Hungarian Empire temporary administration over Bosnia-Herzegovina, though it officially remained part of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

In October 1908, the Austro-Hungarian Empire officially annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This annexation enraged the people of Bosnia, who desired freedom, and also infuriated neighboring Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Many people in these Eastern European countries, sharing a Slavic ethnicity, desired a unified South Slavic Nation, which they called Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Serbia viewed Austria-Hungary's annexation as an invasion of the South Slavs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Initially, Austria-Hungary had a secret agreement with Russia, where Russia would not object to the annexation of Bosnia in exchange for Russia gaining control over the Strait of Bosphorus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. However, strong protests from Slavic people within Russia, who opposed the Austro-Hungarian control over their ethnic kin, forced the Russian foreign minister to support Serbia instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

In 1909, Austria-Hungary sought Germany's support if Russia interfered in a potential conflict with Serbia, and Germany agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Russia then sought France's help, but France refused to interfere in the Bosnian matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. France's refusal forced Russia to accept the annexation of Bosnia, temporarily averting a major war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## The Assassination and Chain Reaction

The annexation did not go unopposed by Bosnians, leading to a new revolutionary movement called "Young Bosnia," composed of students and supported by Serbians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Their goal was to free Bosnia-Herzegovina and unite it with Serbia to form a United South Slavic nation, Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the prince of Austro-Hungary, visited the annexed territory of Bosnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Six Bosnian revolutionaries planned his assassination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. After an initial bomb attempt failed, a 19-year-old student named Gavrilo Princip shot and assassinated Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Princip, a Yugoslav Nationalist, stated his aim was to unite the South Slavs and free Bosnia from Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

The emperor of Austria-Hungary, enraged by the assassination, declared war on Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This triggered a chain reaction:
*   Russia intervened to protect Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   Germany came to the aid of Austria-Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   France supported Russia and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   Italy, initially allied with Austria-Hungary and Germany, reneged on its agreement because the conflict was an invasion by its allies, not an attack on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   The Ottoman Empire joined the Austro-Hungarian side due to its enmity with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   The United Kingdom became involved through the Triple Entente alliance with Russia and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:02]</a>.

This led to the "Great War," later joined by countries like the USA and Japan in support of Britain and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Countries under British rule, such as India, were also drawn into the conflict as Britain needed soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Underlying Causes of World War I

Beyond the immediate spark, there were four main underlying reasons why these countries were so eager to go to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>:

### 1. Nationalism and Imperialism

[[role_of_nationalism_and_imperialism_in_world_war_i | Nationalism]] at the time was often based on race and an aggressive belief in one's country's superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Rulers, taking advantage of this sentiment, convinced people to fight for their country's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

[[role_of_nationalism_and_imperialism_in_world_war_i | Imperialism]], the desire to capture and occupy other countries, was driven by pride, power, and the exploitation of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. By the 1900s, this "looting" process was also carried out by capitalist countries like the East India Company, which drained India's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Some refer to imperialism as the "highest stage of capitalism," where capitalists exploit raw materials and cheap labor for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

> "War is largely a matter of money. The capitalists want new markets, they want new things to exploit. And war is the easiest way to fulfill it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
> — Henry Ford, founder of Ford company

### 2. Militarism

Militarism, the heavy investment in military forces, was essential for imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Countries spent vast sums to invade others by brute force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The combined military spending of the six great powers (Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Italy) increased fourfold from £94 million in 1870 to £370 million by 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### 3. Rule by Monarchs

Most European countries were ruled by monarchs who paid no heed to public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. These rulers, like Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, were often hot-tempered and ruthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Interestingly, the rulers of Germany (Kaiser Wilhelm II), Russia (Tsar Nicholas II), and Britain (King George V) were first cousins, making World War I "literally a Game of Thrones" or a "family feud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

### 4. Alliances

[[alliances_and_international_relations_before_world_war_i | Political alliances]] created a complex web of mutual defense agreements:
*   **Triple Alliance (1882):** Germany, Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. They promised mutual support if any of the Great Powers were attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Triple Entente (1907):** Great Britain, France, and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

These alliances were largely driven by imperialism, as countries sought to protect their captured territories and prevent others from gaining more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Antiwar Movements

[[public_opinion_and_antiwar_movements_during_world_war_i | Public opinion]] generally did not desire World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. However, commoners were pushed into the war due to:
*   **Lack of Employment:** The job of a soldier was often for the poor, who joined for money due to unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Propaganda:** Newspapers and media glorified war and military service, portraying soldiers as noble, disciplined heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Poems like Alfred Tennyson's "The Charge of The Light Brigade" and Rupert Brooke's "The Soldier" depicted war and death as glorious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This propaganda aimed to motivate people to fight for their "country," which effectively meant fighting for the emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

Despite propaganda, many people and groups opposed the war, including America's Socialist Party, the Italian Socialist Party, British Labour Party, Russia's Bolsheviks, Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Anarchists, Syndicalists, and individuals like Henry Ford and Valentine Bulgakov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Poets like Rudyard Kipling and Wilfred Owen wrote about the inhumane conditions and bitter truth of war, aiming to counter the glorification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Thomas Hardy's 1909 poem "The Man He Killed" highlighted the tragedy of soldiers fighting each other who, under different circumstances, might have been friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

There were cases of mutiny, such as an entire battalion in France giving up arms, and Russian soldiers waging war against their own rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The most notable example of antiwar sentiment among soldiers was the Christmas Truce of 1914, where British and German soldiers celebrated Christmas together on the battlefield, exchanging food and singing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Commanders eventually ordered them to stop, punishing those who refused to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

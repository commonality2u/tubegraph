The [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india|Electoral Bonds Scheme]] has been described as the "biggest scam in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. News about the [[electoral_bond_scam|Electoral Bond scam]] reportedly disappeared from TV channels and newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Connection to Arvind Kejriwal's Arrest

The arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is linked to the [[electoral_bond_scam|Electoral Bond scam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Arvind Kejriwal based on statements from four individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

One of these individuals was Sarath Chandra Reddy, head of Aurobindo Pharma Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   On November 9, 2022, Reddy was summoned by the ED for questioning in an alleged liquor scam case, and his statement that day was in favor of Kejriwal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   The very next day, November 10, ED arrested him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Just five days after his arrest, his company, Aurobindo Pharma, donated ₹50 million to the BJP through electoral bonds, which was revealed by the electoral bond data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   Reddy remained in jail for approximately six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. During this period, Arvind Kejriwal stated in court that Reddy gave nine different statements, all of which were in Kejriwal's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   On April 25, 2023, after six months in jail, Reddy was released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. His next statement on the same day was against Kejriwal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   In May 2023, the ED granted him bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   In June 2023, he became an ED approver in the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   Six months after receiving bail, his company made another donation of ₹250 million to the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Corporate Funding and Political Donations

The [[electoral_bond_scam|Electoral Bond data]] indicates that Aurobindo Pharma bought bonds totaling ₹520 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Of this amount:
*   Approximately two-thirds, or ₹340 million, went to the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   ₹150 million went to BRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   ₹25 million went to TDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Atishi, a politician from the Aam Aadmi Party, stated that the money trail in this alleged liquor scam points to the BJP, not the Aam Aadmi Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. She highlighted that Sarath Chandra Reddy's companies' money went directly to the BJP's bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The three other individuals whose statements led to Arvind Kejriwal's arrest reportedly have similar chronologies in their stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Arvind Kejriwal ignored ED's summons, deeming them illegal, as he believed the ED's goal was solely to arrest him to stifle his party and overthrow the governments in Delhi and Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Broader Political Implications

The freezing of bank accounts of the largest opposition party, Congress, and the imposition of significant fines by the Income Tax department, right before the 2024 elections, are seen as tactics that impact [[electoral_integrity_and_challenges_in_ensuring_free_and_fair_elections|electoral integrity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The Communist Party also reportedly faced a fine for using an old PAN card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Opposition candidates are reportedly receiving notices from the ED and IT departments as soon as their candidacies are declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This includes a TMC candidate who received 11 notices from the Income Tax department within 72 hours of his candidacy, some relating to cases from seven years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. A Shiv Sena politician, Amol Kirtikar, received an ED notice an hour after being declared a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

There are also instances where cases against politicians accused of corruption have been closed after they joined the ruling party's alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. An example is Naveen Jindal, a former Congress candidate accused in the Coalgate scam, who joined the BJP on March 25 and promptly received a ticket from the party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

These events contribute to concerns about the [[preservation_of_democracy_and_challenges_to_electoral_integrity_in_india|preservation of democracy]] and the conduct of [[electoral_integrity_and_challenges_in_ensuring_free_and_fair_elections|free and fair elections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. International bodies like the United Nations have expressed hope that Indian citizens will be able to vote freely and fairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The Democracy Report 2024 by Sweden's V-Dem Institute has categorized India as an "Electoral Autocracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This means multi-party elections are held, but there is no fair playing field, and people's freedom is being suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. The report notes that the Modi government has used laws like sedition, defamation, and counter-terrorism to suppress dissenting voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

The fundamental question of whether humans are the only intelligent species in the universe, or if other intelligent beings exist, is a driving force behind many scientific endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The reciprocal question – are aliens alone in the universe – is also considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Establishing communication between intelligent species is a key goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## NASA's Projects for Contact

Keeping the goal of establishing communication in mind, NASA has spearheaded numerous projects aimed at sending messages to potential extraterrestrial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Voyager Missions and Interstellar Exploration

In 1977, NASA launched its Voyager 1 spacecraft with the primary mission to explore our solar system, including its outer planets, the edges of the Sun's effects, and even beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This was an [[interstellar_exploration | interstellar mission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Journey to Interstellar Space

To date, NASA has launched five [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | interstellar spacecrafts]]: Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Only Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have reached [[interstellar_exploration | interstellar space]] due to the extremely long time required to travel beyond our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Voyager 1 officially became the farthest man-made object from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, being 24.7 billion kilometers away as of October 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The concept of "Gravity Assist" was crucial for these missions, using the gravitational force of planets to change a spacecraft's speed and trajectory with less fuel and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This unique geometric arrangement of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, occurring only once every 175 years, made the 1977 launch window ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Scientific Discoveries of Voyager Missions

*   **Jupiter:** Voyager 1 captured amazing time-lapses of Jupiter and its moons in March 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, revealing Jupiter's rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Voyager 1 discovered the ongoing volcanic activity of Jupiter's moon Io, marking the first time humans had seen active volcanoes on another planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The Voyager missions increased the number of known moons of Jupiter from 13 to 16, though 95 different moons have since been discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Saturn:** Voyager 1 reached Saturn on November 12, 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, discovering three new moons: Atlas, Prometheus, and Pandora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Saturn currently has around 146 known moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The moon Titan was identified as the only object in our solar system, apart from Earth, with clear evidence of liquid water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Uranus and Neptune:** Voyager 2 is the only [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] to have flown near Uranus (1986) and Neptune (1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### The Pale Blue Dot

On February 14, 1990, Voyager 1 took the famous "Pale Blue Dot" photo from approximately 6 billion kilometers away, showing Earth as a small blue dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. It also captured a "family portrait" of the inner solar system, including Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. After these photos, Voyager 1's cameras were shut down to save power and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Entering Interstellar Space

Voyager 1 entered [[interstellar_exploration | Interstellar Space]] on August 25, 2012, after leaving the Heliosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. NASA confirmed this 8 months later, in September 2013, after extensive data double-checking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This confirmation was based on the detection of a sudden spike in electron density by its plasma wave instruments, indicating a transition from the solar wind-dominated heliosphere to the interstellar wind-dominated interstellar space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Voyager 2 followed suit, entering interstellar space six years later, on November 5, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Both are the only two space probes to have achieved this feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Communication with Earth

Both Voyager spacecraft communicate with Earth via a high-gain antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. The data transmitted is received by NASA's three Deep Space Network stations located in California, Madrid, and Canberra, Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Messages to Aliens

Both Pioneer and Voyager missions carry messages for potential alien civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Pioneer Plaques

Before the Voyager missions, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 carried small gold-anodized aluminum plates, known as Pioneer plaques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. These 15 cm by 23 cm plates contain five engraved diagrams, intended to inform aliens about Earth and its inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. They include:
*   A radial diagram showing the Sun's position relative to 14 Pulsars, serving as a galactic map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   A diagram of our solar system with the Sun and nine planets (including Pluto), with an arrow pointing to the third planet (Earth) as the origin of the spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   A silhouette of the [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   Drawings of a man and a woman to show human appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

### [[voyagers_messages_to_aliens | Voyager's Messages to Aliens]]: The Golden Record

The messages on the Voyagers are more detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. They consist of 12-inch gold-plated copper discs that function as phonograph records, storing both voices and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. There are two such records on each of Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

The contents of the Golden Record are divided into four sections:
1.  **Scenes from Earth:** Contains 115 images and diagrams providing information about Earth, its species, and basic mathematical, chemical, and physical definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Images include chemical elements, DNA structures, microscopic details of cells, and human activities, notably avoiding negative aspects like conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Images were converted to audio waveforms due to storage limitations and require a reverse process to be viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
2.  **Greetings from Earth:** Includes greetings spoken by humans in 55 languages, as well as printed messages from then-American President Jimmy Carter and UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
3.  **Music from Earth:** Features 28 audio recordings of Eastern and Western classical music from various cultures and eras, including an Indian song based on Raag Bhairavi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
4.  **Sounds of Earth:** Contains 21 audio recordings of natural sounds and human activities and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

Instructions on how to operate the phonograph and decode the images are provided in diagrams, rather than written language, on the record's interstellar envelope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Future and Outlook

Voyager 1 is currently traveling at over 60,000 km per hour, approximately 25 billion kilometers from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. However, its power supply is gradually depleting and is estimated to be entirely depleted by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. While communication may cease, the golden record itself is expected to be preserved indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. The question remains whether any Voyager spacecraft will ever reach an alien civilization capable of decoding its message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

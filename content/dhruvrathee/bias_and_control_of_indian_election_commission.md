The concept of democracy involves more than just holding regular elections; it requires elections to be free and fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Free means people have the freedom to vote for their desired candidate, and fair means all candidates and political parties have an equitable chance of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This contrasts with systems like North Korea, where elections are held but non-government candidates are deemed "anti-national" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, or Russia, where opposition candidates are disqualified or mysteriously killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Allegations of Election Malpractice

Concerns have been raised regarding [[electoral_integrity_and_challenges_in_ensuring_free_and_fair_elections | electoral integrity]] and alleged [[election_fraud_and_irregularities_in_india | election fraud]] in India:

*   **Chandigarh Municipal Corporation Mayor Elections**: In a recent election, the presiding officer allegedly invalidated 8 votes belonging to the Congress and AAP alliance, which collectively had 20 out of 35 votes and were expected to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. CCTV footage reportedly captured this act, leading the Chief Justice of India to describe it as a "murder of democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The Supreme Court ultimately intervened to save the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **EVM Irregularities**: In 2021, an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) was discovered in a BJP candidate's car in Assam, prompting the Election Commission to order a re-poll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. More recently, in February 2024, three unknown individuals attempted to steal an EVM control unit from an office in Pune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Accusations Against the Election Commission (EC)

The Election Commission, an organization expected to conduct free and fair elections, has faced accusations of partiality and bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This accusation dates back to before the May 2014 elections, when Narendra Modi himself accused the EC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Over the last decade, accusations against the EC have intensified, with political strategist Prashant Kishor stating that the EC functions as an "extension of BJP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. He alleged that the EC has bent rules and scheduled elections in ways that consistently benefit the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Instances of Alleged Bias

*   **Violations of Campaign Rules**: The EC has clear directives against mentioning the Indian Army during political campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Despite this, prior to the 2019 elections, PM Modi reportedly used martyrs and airstrikes to solicit votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath also referred to the Indian Army as "Modi's Army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. When a complaint was filed, the EC took no action for 21 days before issuing a clean chit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. PM Modi received clean chits in at least four such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Amit Shah also received a clean chit for comparing Rahul Gandhi's constituency to Pakistan, which is against campaign rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In total, Modi and Shah received clean chits in seven cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Dissenting Election Commissioner**: NDTV reported that one of the three election commissioners had a dissenting opinion in five out of seven cases where clean chits were given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This commissioner was later identified as Ashok Lavasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Following his dissent, his wife, son, daughter, and sister all received notices from government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The Citizen Commission on Elections stated that Lavasa was "silently removed" from the Election Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Erosion of EC Independence

The Supreme Court had previously ordered that the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners should be appointed by a three-member committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India, to ensure independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. However, a few months ago, the government passed a new law removing the Chief Justice of India from this committee and replacing them with a government minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This means that two of the three members in the committee appointing the Election Commissioner will now be from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This change was challenged in the Supreme Court, but the court did not take action, citing separation of powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Campaign Finance and Electoral Bonds

The Election Commission sets limits on election spending (e.g., ₹9.5 million for an MP election) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Despite this, the BJP's declared spending for the 2019 elections was ₹12.64 billion, significantly exceeding the limit for their contested seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The Center for Media Studies estimated BJP's expenditure in the previous elections to be ₹270 billion, accounting for 45% of the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

The issue of electoral bonds has also drawn criticism:
*   Approximately ₹160 billion in electoral bonds have been sold, with over ₹100 billion going to BJP, ₹15 billion to Congress, and ₹8 billion to TMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. These amounts surpass the official spending limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   The Supreme Court recently struck down the Electoral Bonds Scheme, declaring it unconstitutional and an arbitrary rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   An investigation revealed a pattern where at least 23 companies, after being raided by central agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) or Income Tax (IT), subsequently donated millions of rupees to the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. These companies collectively donated ₹3.35 billion to BJP after such raids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

These issues raise questions about the fairness of elections and the extent to which the Election Commission can ensure a level playing field, contributing to [[challenges_to_indian_democracy_and_opposition | challenges to Indian democracy and opposition]] and concerns about [[concerns_about_dictatorship_in_india | dictatorship in India]].

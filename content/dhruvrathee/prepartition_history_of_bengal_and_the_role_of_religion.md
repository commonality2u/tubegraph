Before the period of the British Raj, the Indian subcontinent, encompassing present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Burma, and Sri Lanka, was characterized by thousands of autonomous kingdoms, each possessing unique languages, traditions, and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Muslim Rule in Bengal (13th - 18th Century)

The region of Bengal, which included areas that are now Bangladesh and West Bengal, was primarily governed by Muslim monarchs starting from the 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Mohammad Bakhtiyar Khilji, the founder of the Khilji dynasty, initiated Muslim rule in this area in the early 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Significantly, these rulers were not primarily interested in religious proselytization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Their focus was on integrating local communities into their system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. High-ranking officials, traders, and musicians during this period came from diverse religious backgrounds and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This led to a strong [[communalism_versus_seculari_in_indian_history | co-existence]] and intermingling of Islam and Hinduism, which largely kept extremism in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## British Control and the Road to Partition

In 1757, the East India Company gained control of the Bengal region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, marking the beginning of British Rule, which lasted until 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

The call for a separate Muslim state began to formalize in the 1940s. In 1940, during the All India Muslim League's annual session, the Lahore Resolution was drafted, demanding a distinct state for Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This demand stemmed from the fear that if India remained united, Muslims would be a minority and live in constant apprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### The [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | Partition of India]] and Bengal

The eventual [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | partition]] of India into India and Pakistan in 1947 was a devastating event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The borders were primarily drawn along religious lines, disregarding existing social, commercial, and cultural relationships among communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Large regions sharing common cultures and languages were divided solely based on religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Punjab and Bengal were two major examples of this division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

A portion of Bengal remained with India, while another became part of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Despite the division, people in these split regions continued to speak the same language and follow the same culture and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Many Muslims in Bengal supported the creation of Pakistan, hoping that a new Muslim country would lead to an improved standard of living and better financial and social conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. They felt inferior to Hindu landlords and expected their fundamental rights from the Pakistani government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

The partition resulted in mass displacement, with large-scale migration of Muslims to Pakistan and Hindus to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This period was also marked by widespread riots and mob violence, with estimated death tolls ranging from 200,000 to 2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Muslims living in Bihar, particularly those closer to Bengal, migrated to East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. These "Muslim Biharis" would later be viewed as "Anti-Bangladeshi" due to their association with Urdu and support for West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Regarding Bengal's specific decision:
*   Initially, Bengal as a single state voted against [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | Partition]] if it meant being entirely part of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   West Bengal favored partition and wished to join India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   East Bengal did not want partition but, if it was inevitable, desired to join Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Ultimately, West Bengal became part of India, and East Bengal became part of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The newly formed country of Pakistan was thus split into two parts, separated by 1,500 km of Indian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Interestingly, the Bengali ethnic group formed the majority of the new country's population, with over half residing in East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Despite this demographic majority, powerful positions in bureaucracy, military, and politics were concentrated in West Pakistan, largely in the hands of Mohajirs and Punjabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This unequal distribution of power and resources, combined with cultural and linguistic differences, laid the groundwork for future tensions that would eventually lead to the birth of Bangladesh.

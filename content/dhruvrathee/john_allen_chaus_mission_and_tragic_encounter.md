In November 2018, John Allen Chau, a 26-year-old American missionary, illegally traveled to India's North Sentinel Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His purpose was to teach Christianity to the inhabitants, believed to be the world's last uncontacted tribe, the North Sentinelese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They know "nearly nothing" about the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Background: The North Sentinelese and Their Island

North Sentinel Island is a small island, approximately 60 km² (23 sq mi), covered by dense forest, and is part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The island is about 50 km from Port Blair, the capital of South Andaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The tribe living there, whom outsiders call the North Sentinelese, are believed to be direct descendants of people who migrated out of Africa about 70,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. They are considered a Stone Age tribe, maintaining a hunter-gatherer lifestyle without agriculture, which was discovered about 12,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

The North Sentinelese are the most isolated tribe globally because they actively choose to remain isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Historically, attempts at contact from the outside world have largely resulted in violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. An incident in 1880, where British officer Maurice Vidal Portman kidnapped an old couple and four children from the island, likely introduced foreign germs, causing illness and death among the tribe upon the children's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This event is believed to be a major reason for the tribe's violent reaction to outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The Indian government banned travel to the island after 1997, adopting an "Eyes-On, Hands-Off" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## John Allen Chau's Journey and First Encounter

Chau's obsession with his religion led him to North Sentinel Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. He traveled to a nearby island and bribed a fisherman with ₹25,000 to drop him off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. On the night of November 14, 2018, they began their journey, hiding from coast guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Chau brought a GoPro camera, scissors, a kayak, dried fish, a football, and a Bible, hoping to offer them as gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

On the morning of November 15, 2018, Chau instructed the fisherman to wait at a distance while he paddled alone to the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. After spotting houses and hearing women, he encountered two Sentinelese men with bows and arrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He greeted them, saying:
> "My name is John, I love you, and Jesus loves you. Jesus Christ gave me the authority to come here to you. Here is some fish for you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

The men responded by drawing their arrows, causing John to panic and leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Second Attempt and Arrow Attack

Hours later, Chau tried again, approaching the island's north shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. He saw about six Sentinelese people shouting in his direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. As no one outside the tribe can understand their language, Chau attempted to repeat syllables he heard, which caused the Sentinelese to laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He slowly approached, dropping gifts, including a child and a young girl carrying bows and arrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Chau got off his kayak and tried to talk to a child, while a Sentinelese man stole his kayak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Moments later, the child shot an arrow at Chau's chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The arrow struck his Bible by chance, sparing his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Without his kayak, Chau swam back to the boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Chau's Diary Entries and Unwavering Obsession

That night, Chau wrote in his diary, reflecting his conflicted state:
> "Lord, is this island Satan's last stronghold?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
> "Is this island full of monsters where the natives haven't even heard Jesus's name?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
> "I don't want to die. I should go back. Lord, I don't want to die." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

Despite his fear, his religious obsession had turned into "madness," and he convinced himself that returning to the island was his life's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## The Final Journey and Tragic End

On November 16, 2018, Chau wrote a letter to his family:
> "You guys might think I'm crazy but I think it's worth it to declare Jesus to these people. If I get killed, please, do not blame these people." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>

After writing this, he set out for North Sentinel Island once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This time, he did not return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The local fisherman who had transported him watched from afar as the Sentinelese buried a body, which he recognized by the clothes as John Allen Chau's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## The Implications of Contact

Chau's tragic encounter highlights the dangers and ethical concerns surrounding contact with uncontacted tribes. In 2006, two local fishermen mistakenly ventured too close to the island and were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This led the government to establish a 5 km (3.1 mi) exclusion zone around the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

There is an ongoing debate about whether to continue efforts to contact such tribes to introduce them to modern advancements, or to protect them by maintaining their isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Arguments for isolation include:
*   **Disease:** Outsiders carry diseases against which isolated tribes have no immunity, leading to potential devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Cultural Disruption:** Past attempts to integrate tribes, such as the Jarawa tribe in the Andaman, have shown mixed results. While some adapted, many became unhappy, struggled with modern food, and developed addictions to substances like tobacco and alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Their unique cultures, languages, and traditions are at risk of being lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. For example, the Great Andamanese Tribe, which numbered around 5,000 in the 1800s, has only 41 remaining members today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

The Sentinelese are believed to live sustainably, harmoniously with nature, without issues of overpopulation or animal extinction, a rarity in human communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Continued attempts at contact, as demonstrated by John Allen Chau's mission, could jeopardize their entire community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

The Electoral Bond Scam, described by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's economist husband as potentially the largest scam in the world, is not merely a financial scandal but encompasses various types of illicit activities. These include the theft of public funds, awarding government tenders to unworthy companies, allowing tax-evading companies to continue operating, and extortion. Crucially, some instances within this collection of scams directly impacted the lives of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This article details how regulatory failures, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector, have put public health at risk, often linked to political donations through electoral bonds. These issues highlight broader [[systemic_issues_in_law_enforcement_and_governance | systemic issues in law enforcement and governance]] and [[corruption_and_governance_reforms | corruption and governance reforms]].

## Substandard Medicines and Lack of Oversight

The issue of substandard medicines raises a critical question: if deaths occur due to poor-quality medication, can it truly be considered an act of God's will? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> Unfortunately, the scenario of government regulators overlooking the poor quality of medicines, leading to fatalities, is a grim reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Zydus Cadila and Remdesivir

A December 2021 report by health reporter Priyanka Pulla in Live Mint exposed a significant incident from May 2021 during India's second COVID-19 wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Adverse Reactions:** Patients in Uttar Pradesh's Chiranjeev Hospital and Lifeline Hospital experienced severe symptoms like high fever, shivering, and plummeting blood oxygen levels shortly after receiving the Remdesivir antiviral medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Identical Batch:** Investigations revealed that patients in both hospitals received medication from the same batch, V100167, manufactured by Gujarat-based Zydus Cadila, which the UP government had procured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Doctors stopped using this batch, and patient conditions improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Widespread Issues:** Similar reports emerged from other hospitals in Uttar Pradesh, including Jhansi Maharani Lakshmi Bai Medical College and Meerut's Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Patients who purchased Remdesivir from batches like V100156 also developed fever and breathing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **National Problem:** News of patients falling sicker after taking Remdesivir from similar batches (V100153, 156, 166, 167, 170, L100148) manufactured by Cadila spread from Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Bihar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Inaction:** Despite concerns raised by many hospitals, state regulators in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Gujarat largely failed to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Only Bihar's regulators raised a red flag, testing the V100167 batch and finding bacterial endotoxins, compounds causing fever and potential septic shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Gujarat FDCA's Failure:** A case was filed against Zydus Cadila in Patna, but the manufacturing unit was in Gujarat, making the Gujarat FDCA responsible for quality checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Despite being informed by Bihar's regulator, the Gujarat FDCA did not test these batches, and there is no proof they recalled the medicines, as required by the Drugs and Cosmetics law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **WHO's Prior Warning:** Six months prior, in November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had advised against using Remdesivir, finding it ineffective against COVID-19 after a study involving over 14,000 people across 35 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Nevertheless, the Indian government approved Remdesivir and planned to increase its production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Electoral Bond Connection:** Zydus Cadila donated ₹180 million to the BJP, which formed both the central and Gujarat governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The company also donated ₹30 million to Congress (then in power in Rajasthan) and ₹80 million to Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM), a BJP ally in power in Sikkim, which is a pharma hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This demonstrates a clear link between [[corruption_and_governance_reforms | political donations]] and lax [[pharmaceutical_quality_control_issues | quality control]].

### Glenmark Pharmaceuticals

Between 2022 and 2023, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals received five notices for substandard medicines, four from the Maharashtra Food and Drugs Administration. Their blood pressure regulating medicine was deemed substandard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. In November 2022, the company bought electoral bonds worth ₹97.5 million, all of which were encashed by the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Torrent Pharma

Gujarat-based Torrent Pharma's antiplatelet medicine Deplatt 150 failed the salicylic acid test and was declared substandard by Maharashtra FDA in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. In October 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned the company for repeated quality-related failures in its manufacturing units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Despite these warnings, Torrent Pharma bought electoral bonds worth ₹775 million between May 2019 and January 2024, with the majority (₹610 million) going to the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The BJP government in Gujarat took no action despite the US FDA's warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Cipla

Cipla, a major pharma company, received four show-cause notices regarding its medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. In August 2018, its RC cough syrup failed to meet standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. In July 2021, it received two notices for its Remdesivir medicine, which was found to have insufficient quantities of the active ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Cipla bought electoral bonds worth ₹392 million, with ₹370 million going to the BJP and ₹22 million to Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The timing of Cipla's bond purchases aligns with political changes in Maharashtra, with purchases in July and October 2019 (before BJP was removed from power) and again in November 2022 (after the BJP coalition government was formed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Fatal Contaminated Cough Syrups

The consequences of regulatory failures are dire, particularly when they involve medicines for children.
*   **Marion Biotech (Uzbekistan):** In December 2022, 18 children in Uzbekistan died from substandard cough syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The WHO linked these deaths to Ambronol Syrup and Dok1-Max Syrup, manufactured by Uttar Pradesh-based Marion Biotech, which contained high amounts of toxic diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The company had been using industrial-grade propylene glycol from an unlicensed supplier, which is toxic for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   **Uzbekistan's Response:** The Uzbekistani Ministry of Health banned all drugs imported by the distributor, Quramax Medical, canceled its license, ordered the destruction of remaining medicines, and sentenced 23 people, including Quramax's Indian Executive Director, to imprisonment for 2 to 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
    *   **India's Response:** In India, an investigation by the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation found 22 samples of Marion Biotech's cough syrup to be adulterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. While the Pharmaceutical Export Promotion Council of India suspended Marion Biotech's registration, and Uttar Pradesh authorities canceled its manufacturing license and arrested three employees, these employees were later released on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The Allahabad High Court ruled that directors Sachin Jain and Jaya Jain could not be arrested without conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Shockingly, by October 2023, the Uttar Pradesh government allowed the company to reopen its factory, though not to manufacture products containing propylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This highlights a critical [[intelligence_failure_and_government_accountability | lack of government accountability]] in India compared to Uzbekistan.
*   **Maiden Pharmaceuticals and Riemann Labs (Gambia & Cameroon):** Children in Gambia and Cameroon also died due to contaminated cough syrups, with Haryana-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals and Madhya Pradesh-based Riemann Labs implicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. In total, 141 children lost their lives, with Marion Biotech's cough syrup linked to 68 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   **Digital Vision Pharma (J&K):** In September 2023, it was reported that around 12 children in Udhampur district, J&K, died after consuming cough syrup with high amounts of diethylene glycol, manufactured by Digital Vision Pharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This company also used industrial-grade ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Despite the deaths, it took three years to file a charge sheet, and four years later, no one has been found guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The company had received at least 16 warnings from Maharashtra and Gujarat drug regulators prior to the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Softening Penalties and Continued Failures

In December 2023, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation found that 54 pharma companies failed export quality tests for cough syrups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This undermines India's reputation as the "Pharmacy of the World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Instead of strengthening quality control, the government passed the Jan Vishwas Bill in August 2023, which aims to ease penalties for low-quality drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Public health activists, like Dinesh Thakur, argue that decriminalizing such offenses is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. A key amendment to Section 27D of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act replaced potential 1-2 years imprisonment for failing lab tests with an out-of-court compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Hetero

Maharashtra's FDA issued six notices to Hetero for substandard drugs, three of which concerned their Remdesivir medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Despite such numerous violations, which should have led to the cancellation of its manufacturing license, Hetero merely recalled the medicines and purchased electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. The Hetero group donated ₹1.2 billion to BRS (then in power in Telangana), whose founder and chairman were subsequently given Rajya Sabha seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. When the BJP returned to power in Maharashtra in 2022, they encashed ₹150 million from this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

The extensive list of companies implicated in manufacturing substandard drugs, coupled with their significant donations via electoral bonds, reveals a deeply troubling pattern of [[corruption_and_governance_reforms | corruption]] and [[intelligence_failure_and_government_accountability | regulatory failures]]. While Prime Minister Modi claimed that electoral bonds allowed transparency in political funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>, the truth is that the scheme was designed for secret political funding, and its details only emerged after the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Pharma companies collectively donated ₹9.45 billion to political parties through these bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

This exposé relies on the investigative efforts of Project Electoral Bond, a collaborative initiative by Newslaundry, Scroll, The News Minute, and other independent journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

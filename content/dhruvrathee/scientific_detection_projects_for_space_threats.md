Earth's defense systems against potential space threats are robust and constantly improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Various projects and systems are in place to detect and track [[near_earth_objects_and_risk_management | Near Earth Objects]] (NEOs), which include asteroids and comets that pass close to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. While these systems generally work well, occasional errors can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Current Detection Projects

There are four prominent detection projects actively monitoring space for potential threats:

### Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR)
Started in 1996 as a joint collaboration between the US Air Force, [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | NASA]], and MIT, LINEAR utilizes two 1-meter and one 0.5-meter telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This project discovers over 10,000 objects annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, accounting for 65% of all asteroid discoveries today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### Catalina Sky Survey (CSS)
Established in 1998 by the University of Arizona, CSS employs two large telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Its precision is notable; in 2008, it detected a 4-meter diameter asteroid and accurately predicted its exact time, day, and location of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The asteroid fell in the desert of North Sudan just 19 hours after the prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (PAN-STARRS)
Located in Hawaii, PAN-STARRS uses the world's largest digital cameras to find asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. These cameras capture images with 1.4 billion pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)
Also situated in Hawaii, ATLAS serves as a final warning system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Its purpose is to provide a last-minute alert in case other systems fail to detect an asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. ATLAS scans the sky twice every night to detect any danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## Future Improvements

[[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | NASA]] plans to launch a new space telescope called Near Earth Object Surveyor in 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This telescope will be stationed outside Earth to further enhance the detection capabilities for asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

While Earth's defense system is considered "brilliant and strong," there are continuous efforts to improve detection and response strategies to ensure preparedness against potential celestial impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

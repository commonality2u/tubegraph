In July 2024, Bangladesh experienced widespread student protests against the government's quota system for public sector jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. What began as peaceful demonstrations quickly escalated into violent clashes, leading to a military curfew, suspension of mobile internet services, and the shutdown of schools and colleges across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. At least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in these clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Protesters have begun calling Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasinas government and accusations of dictatorship | Sheikh Hasina]] a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Quota System

The protests primarily target the government's quota system, which reserves 56% of public sector jobs for different sections of society, leaving only 44% available on merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Unlike India's reservation system, which is largely caste-based, Bangladesh's quota system is primarily structured around the descendants of "freedom fighters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The 56% reservation is distributed as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>:
*   **30%** for descendants of freedom fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>
*   **10%** for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>
*   **10%** "Zila Quota" for backward districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   **5%** for ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   **1%** for people with physical disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>

## Historical Context

To understand the freedom fighter quota, it is necessary to examine [[Prepartition History of Bengal and the Role of Religion | Bangladesh's history]] as East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### [[Economic and Political Disparities between East and West Pakistan | Discrimination and Conflict in East Pakistan]]
Before its independence in 1971, Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan, while present-day Pakistan was West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. [[Historical context of language and economic discrimination in Bangladesh | East Pakistan faced rampant social, economic, and political discrimination]] from West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>:
*   **Language Imposition**: Despite Bengali being spoken by the majority (over 90%) in East Pakistan, Urdu was imposed as the official language by West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This contributed to the [[Influence of Language Imposition and Cultural Differences Leading to Bangladeshs Independence | linguistic and cultural divide]] that led to Bangladesh's independence.
*   **Economic Exploitation**: East Pakistan contributed 59% of the country's exports, but only 25% of industrial investments went to East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Disaster Neglect**: Following Cyclone Bhola in November 1970, which killed an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 people in East Pakistan, West Pakistan made little effort to provide relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Political Marginalization**: In the 1970 elections, the Awami League Party, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won an overwhelming majority of seats in East Pakistan, making it the dominant party for both East and West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. However, West Pakistan's military, led by Commander-in-Chief Yahya Khan, refused to accept the election results, imposing martial law on East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### [[Bangladesh Liberation War and its Causes | The Liberation War]]
In response to the martial law, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman initiated a civil disobedience movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The West Pakistani military committed large-scale atrocities, including the arrest of Mujibur Rahman and a genocide that killed hundreds of thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Approximately 10 million people sought refuge in [[Security concerns and resource allocation in India | India]], and about 50% of East Pakistan's population was internally displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War and its Causes | Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971]], where India, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, aided Bangladesh in achieving independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Those who fought for freedom became known as "freedom fighters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Evolution of the Freedom Fighter Quota
The freedom fighter quota originated in 1972, a year after independence, when the Ministry of Cabinet Services issued an order reserving 30% of jobs for those who fought for the country's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Initially, this quota was only for the freedom fighters themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **1997**: The quota was extended to the children of freedom fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **2010**: It was further extended to the grandchildren of freedom fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Recent Protests and Government Actions

### Earlier Movements and 2018 Reversal
The decision to include grandchildren in the quota system in 2010 led to a significant movement against it in 2012-2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Given the severe job shortage in Bangladesh, where around 400,000 graduates compete for only 3,000 civil service jobs annually, the quota system intensified competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. In February 2018, the Bangladesh's General Students' Rights Conservation Council demanded reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Amidst student clashes, the government, under pressure, issued a circular in October 2018 removing the quota system for first and second-class jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### 2024 Reintroduction and Protests Rekindle
In 2021, seven students from freedom fighters' families challenged the removal of the quota system in the High Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. On June 5, 2024, the High Court declared the government's 2018 circular illegal and reintroduced the quota system, reigniting widespread protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Students, including Fahim Farooqui from Dhaka University, stated that the protests aim for a complete reformation of the quota system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. They demand the removal of all reservations except those for ethnic minorities and people with physical disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Allegations and Government Response
Protesters argue that the quota for future generations of freedom fighters is unconstitutional and illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. They also allege corruption, claiming the ruling Awami League, led by [[Sheikh Hasinas government and accusations of dictatorship | Sheikh Hasina]], disproportionately benefits from the quota system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Over 60,000 objections have been raised against names on the freedom fighter list, which the government has not resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

On July 10, the Supreme Court imposed a stay on the High Court's order, but the protests persisted, with opposition parties like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party joining in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The government deployed over 7,000 paramilitary troops, using tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound grenades against protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The United Nations Secretary-General urged the government to refrain from violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Clashes also occurred between protesters and the Bangladesh Student League, the student wing of the Awami League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

The government claimed willingness to talk and formed a Judicial Probe Committee to investigate violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, the main protest group, Students Against Discrimination, expressed doubts about the government's intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Controversial Remarks and "Razakar" Accusations

Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasinas government and accusations of dictatorship | Sheikh Hasina]] made controversial remarks, accusing protesters of hating freedom fighters and questioning if "Razakars'" grandchildren should receive benefits if freedom fighters' descendants do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Other ministers, including Dipu Moni and Muhammad Ali Arafat, echoed these sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### The Term "Razakar"
"Razakar" is a Persian word meaning "volunteer" or "helper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. However, in the context of the 1971 war, "Razakar Bahini" was a paramilitary group of about 50,000 people who supported the West Pakistan army and participated in atrocities against East Pakistanis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. In Bangladesh, the word "Razakar" is synonymous with "treacherous" and "anti-national" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's government introduced the International Crimes Tribunal Act in 1973 to punish these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Calling protesters "Razakars" is seen as a "straw man fallacy," distorting their arguments and labeling legitimate criticism as treachery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Critics point out the hypocrisy, as PM Sheikh Hasina's own government removed the reservation in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Underlying Issues and Economic Challenges

On July 21, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh suggested reducing the freedom fighter descendants' quota to 5% and other quotas (ethnic minorities, transgenders, disabled) to 2%, limiting total reservation to 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

While the quota system is the immediate trigger, the underlying issue is [[economic_challenges_and_unemployment_in_bangladesh | widespread unemployment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Public Administration Minister Farad Hussain noted over 500,000 vacant government jobs in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Each year, 1.8 to 1.9 million young people enter the job market, and of Bangladesh's 110 million working population, 30 million are unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

Bangladesh's economy is struggling with low foreign exchange reserves, requiring assistance from the International Monetary Fund in 2022 and a potential $5 billion loan from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Inflation rates are high at 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Improving the reservation system is only a first step; long-term solutions require a focus on job creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

In January, [[Sheikh Hasinas government and accusations of dictatorship | Sheikh Hasina]] won her fourth consecutive term as Prime Minister amidst accusations of electoral rigging, further fueling discontent and leading to protesters calling her a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

In 1965, Singapore was a country grappling with widespread poverty and unemployment, high crime rates, drug-related problems, frequent riots, overpopulation, and illiteracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, over the next 25 years, Singapore underwent a remarkable transformation, becoming a highly developed, high-income nation, now considered among the top 5 richest countries in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is also recognized as one of the cleanest countries with virtually no corruption or other crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Geographic and Demographic Context
Singapore is a tiny island nation, half the size of Delhi area-wise, with approximately 5.7 million people residing in its 710 km² area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This results in a high population density of 8028 people per square kilometre, making it the third most densely populated country globally, after Monaco and Macao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Its name originates from the Sanskrit word "Singh Pura," meaning "The Lion City" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Singapore is one of the "Four Asian Tigers"—highly developed Asian countries along with South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan—all of which have higher population densities than India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Singapore is a diverse country, home to people from various religions living harmoniously, including five major religions and smaller communities like Jewish, Zorastrian, Jain, and Sikh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A significant portion of the population (74.5%) is of Chinese ethnicity, followed by Malays (13.5%) and Indians (9%), with Eurasians and Arabs making up the remaining 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The Orang Laut, tribals who are the original inhabitants, also live in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Historical Challenges
For a long time, Singapore was used as a trading island by Malay, Thai, Indian, Arab, Japanese, and Chinese traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. It was occupied by various powers, including an Indonesian ruler, the Portuguese, and the Dutch East India Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. In 1819, Thomas Raffles of the British East India Company bought Singapore and transformed it into a Free Port, leading to free trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 further increased ship traffic, and Singapore became a refuelling station and a rubber-processing hub due to its proximity to Malaysia's tin and rubber industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

However, this period also had a dark side: the British processed opium in Singapore, leading to widespread drug addiction among Chinese porters employed there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. By 1941, an estimated 16,500 opium addicts lived in Singapore, contributing to increased crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

During World War II, Japan invaded and conquered Singapore on February 15, 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The 3.5 years of Japanese rule devastated Singapore, marked by murders, torture of Prisoners of War, forced labor, and the use of women in "Comfort Stations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. By 1945, when Japan withdrew, Singapore was left with over 30,000 opium addicts, rampant gambling and prostitution, heavily destroyed buildings, large-scale poverty, high unemployment, widespread diseases, food shortages, and severe crime and violence, effectively turning it into a slum colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

After the war, the British reclaimed control, and a British Military Administration worked to restore basic services like gas, water, and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Singaporeans held a positive view of the British due to their defeat of the Japanese and the Labour Party's anti-imperialist stance in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This led to a gradual transition to self-governance, with the first elections held in 1948 and full-scale elections in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Merger with Malaysia and Independence
In 1959, [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]], Secretary General of the People's Action Party (PAP), became Singapore's first Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Initially, he believed Singapore could not survive independently and merged it with Malaysia in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, this merger faced issues: Malaysian politicians disliked PAP contesting their national elections, and Singaporeans were unhappy with paying 40% of their revenue to Malaysia despite being only 17% of the combined population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Discrimination against Chinese and other non-Malay ethnicities under Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution also caused resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. These tensions led to communal riots in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, culminating in Singapore's separation and re-establishment as an independent country, the Republic of Singapore, in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Further challenges arose when the British announced their withdrawal of troops by 1971, which was problematic as British forces provided jobs and Singapore lacked its own army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] successfully requested a postponement of the withdrawal to allow for a proper transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Policies for Economic Development

Facing poverty, unemployment, drug addiction, riots, and a lack of natural resources, Prime Minister [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] embarked on a series of transformative policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Geopolitical Stability and Defence
To ensure peace with neighbouring countries, [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] co-founded the ASEAN group in 1967, bringing together foreign ministers from five countries to foster collaboration, cooperation, and regional stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Simultaneously, he introduced compulsory National Service in 1967, requiring boys aged 18 to join the Army, Defence Forces, or National Service for a few years, ensuring national defence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Education and Skill Development
Recognizing education as fundamental to development, Singapore implemented compulsory primary education and established high-quality public schools and colleges with impressive infrastructure at nominal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. A strong emphasis was also placed on [[singapores_education_and_vocational_training_systems | vocational training]] to equip citizens with practical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Social Harmony and Integration
[[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] committed to making Singapore a multi-racial, secular nation where all citizens are equal, not defined by race, religion, language, or culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. To counter communal tensions and self-segregation, he introduced an [[singapores_ethnic_diversity_and_integration_policies | Ethnic Integration Policy]] for government housing, mandating fixed ethnic ratios in buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This policy ensured that Chinese, Malay, and Indians lived together, fostering interaction and harmonious living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act was passed in 1990, establishing a Presidential Council for Religious Harmony, with two-thirds of its members being representatives of major religions, tasked with promoting inter-religious interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Additionally, Racial Harmony Day, observed annually on July 21st, sees school children dress in traditional costumes of other religions and read the Declaration of Religious Harmony, instilling principles of secularism, diversity, and unity from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

### Urban Planning and Cleanliness
[[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] prioritized cleanliness as a hallmark of civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. The "Keep Singapore Clean Campaign," launched in 1968 and running intermittently until 1988, was a comprehensive initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Key measures included:
*   Licensing public waste collectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   Providing blue recycling bins in public housing estates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   Creating numerous public toilets and running programs like the "Happy Toilet Program" for maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   Banning chewing gum in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   Imposing heavy fines for spitting, littering, and smoking (S$1,000 for first offence, up to S$5,000 for third) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

To address slums, over 26,000 families were relocated to high-rise public housing with provided water, electricity, and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. By 2021, about 80% of Singaporeans lived in government-provided housing, leading to minimal homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Urban planning also involved relocating 4,900 hawkers to food centres, developing new wholesale markets for vegetable sellers, phasing out pig and duck farms from catchment areas, and cleaning rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. More than 2,800 industries were relocated to improve the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. These initiatives contributed significantly to [[singapores_cleanliness_and_environmental_initiatives | Singapore's cleanliness and environmental initiatives]].

### Healthcare and Transport
Singapore developed inexpensive public and private healthcare systems under the Ministry of Health, equipping government hospitals with thousands of beds and introducing innovative systems like MediSafe, MediShield, and MediFund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

Given its small size and high population density, Singapore discouraged car ownership to conserve land for residential areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. It is one of the most expensive cities to buy a car due to heavy taxes, and new car registrations require replacing an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Conversely, public transport (buses and metro) is among the least expensive, cleanest, and safest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

### Fiscal Management and Economic Model
Despite providing affordable education, healthcare, public transportation, and housing, Singapore maintains low income tax rates (2% to 24%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. The government funds these services through a unique model focused on sustainability and fiscal surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. A key component is government ownership of highly profitable companies like Temasek Holdings, which had a net portfolio of $403 billion as of March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. These state-owned enterprises, managed efficiently, channel profits back to the government and, by extension, the citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. Other revenue sources include high taxes on motor vehicles, wealth tax, property tax, and GST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. Fiscal discipline rules are enshrined in their constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

Singapore also implemented a Central Provident Fund, where individuals deposit a portion of their salaries, contributing to one of the world's highest savings rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. In 2021, Gross Domestic Savings were 57.5% of GDP, placing Singapore among the top 3 countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

### Attracting Foreign Investment and Combating Corruption
Recognizing the lack of natural resources, [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] adopted a two-pronged approach to kickstart the economy:
1.  **Large-scale government spending:** Investing in major infrastructure projects like world-class ports and airports (e.g., Changi Airport), and establishing entities like the Housing Development Board and Economic Development Board, which generated significant employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
2.  **Opening the economy to foreign investment:** Leveraging its strategic location as a long-standing port for international trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. To attract foreign investment, Singapore ensured stability and ease of doing business by reducing tax rates, eliminating red tape and paperwork, developing a single trade window, dismissing corrupt government workers, and easing business processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Today, Singapore ranks second globally in ease of doing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Crucial to this success was the elimination of corruption. Singapore is the 4th least corrupt country in the world, and the only Asian country in the top 10 for the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] implemented several measures:
*   **High Salaries:** Government employees, politicians, and ministers receive exceptionally high salaries (e.g., Singapore's current Prime Minister is the highest-paid in the world at $1.61 million), reducing the incentive for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
*   **Performance-Related Pay:** Salaries include a component linked to performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Severe Punishment:** Heavy penalties for corruption, including fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment up to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
*   **Independent Anti-Corruption Agency:** The Prevention of Corruption Act was introduced in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) was granted more powers and operational autonomy, allowing it to investigate even political leaders without interference, despite working under the Prime Minister's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

### Industrial Diversification and [[Employment and Skill Development Initiatives | Skill Development]]
Initially focused on textile and petrochemical refineries, [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] steered Singapore away from being a low-cost factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. He ensured Singaporeans learned skills through technical schools and internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. A law mandated that employers pay a monthly Skills Development Levy to a Skills Development Fund, supporting workforce upgrading programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. By the 1990s, this emphasis on [[alternative_employment_opportunities_and_skill_development | skill development]] enabled Singapore to integrate into global supply chains for sophisticated technologies like biotech engineering, aerospace, integrated circuits, pharmaceuticals, petroleum chemicals, and semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

## Legacy of [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]]
Despite his instrumental role in transforming Singapore from "rags to riches," [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] actively prevented a personality cult around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. There are no busts, statues, monuments, or temples dedicated to him in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. He was a pragmatic and educated leader who focused on development rather than self-image and was open to suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.

While often categorized as a "benevolent dictator" due to his stance against free speech and the country's low press freedom index during his governance, Singapore's case is considered exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This is attributed to [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]]'s self-accountability and willingness to listen to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The key takeaway from Singapore's success lies in the specific policies he implemented to achieve national development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

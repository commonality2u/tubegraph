The shocking crime involving a 31-year-old trainee doctor in Kolkata's R.G.Kar hospital brought the issue of [[womens_safety_in_india | women's safety]] to the forefront, leading to widespread protests across the country, including West Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Doctors went on strike, and the hospital was ransacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This incident, while immediately sparking [[public_outrage_and_social_medias_role_in_seeking_justice | public outrage]], highlights deeper issues within societal attitudes and a pervasive rape culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

Despite the collective shock, the number of rape cases continues to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. In 2012, approximately 25,000 cases were reported annually, a number that grew to 31,000 in 2022, averaging 85 rape cases per day, according to NCRB figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This increase, even proportionally to population growth, indicates a worsening situation where the root causes of rape persist and intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## The "Ifs and Buts" of Rape: Conditional Condemnation

While society broadly agrees that rape is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, this condemnation often comes with "conditions" that undermine the principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Political and Societal Opinions
Rape threats are often used against individuals with unpopular political or historical views.
*   **Nupur Sharma**: Received death and rape threats after making objectionable statements about Prophet Mohammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Audrey Truschke**: A historian who wrote about Aurangzeb, faced death and rape threats for her academic findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Indira Jaising**: A human rights lawyer who spoke against capital punishment for Nirbhaya's rapists, was labeled a "rapist sympathizer" and called to be jailed with rapists by Kangana Ranaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

This "trap of political opinion" allows for the release and honoring of convicted rapists, as seen with Bilkis Bano's attackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Figures like Prajwal Revanna, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, Brij Bhusan Singh, Kuldeep Sengar, and those accused in the Kathua case have received public support or political patronage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Romantic Relationships and Consent
Some media outlets and political leaders attempt to downplay or justify rape by claiming a romantic relationship between the victim and the accused.
*   **Hathras Case**: Sudhir Chaudhary of Zee News and Anamika of News18 claimed the victim had romantic relations with the accused, citing call records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Arnab Goswami even denied the rape occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Manoharlal Khattar (Former Haryana CM)**: Stated that in 80-90% of cases, the accused and victim know each other, implying that girls falsely accuse boys after fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal CM)**: In the 2022 Nadia rape case involving a minor, she claimed the girl had a love affair with the boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

This reasoning ignores the fundamental principle of consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Rape is a violation of freedom, regardless of prior relationship, and consent is reversible and crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. For minors, consent is not even considered, with the age of consent set at 18 under the POCSO Act of 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Time of Day and Location
Victim-blaming often extends to questioning why girls are "out late at night."
*   **Pramod Sawant (Goa CM)**: After two minors were raped, he questioned why the girls were out at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Jharkhand MLA**: Blamed parents for letting their daughters go out after evening after a tribal girl was raped and murdered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Mukesh Singh (Nirbhaya Rapist)**: Believed that if a girl goes out at night and wears "wrong" clothes, she is responsible for the rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

This argument is nonsensical; rape occurs because rapists are active, not because victims are out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Furthermore, NCRB reports consistently show that over 90% of rape cases involve an accused known to the victim, including neighbors, friends, co-workers, and even family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Victim's "Character" and Clothing
The notion of a victim's "loose character" or clothing choice as a justification for sexual harassment is a prevalent form of victim blaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   Statements like "drinking and going out with guys" or wearing "short clothes" are used to imply a victim "asked for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   Some believe women are either goddesses or mere objects, failing to treat them as humans with individual rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   Films often propagate harmful stereotypes, such as *Tees Mar Khan* trivializing the dignity of a sex worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

In reality, every woman, regardless of profession or lifestyle, has a right to freedom and bodily autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Films like *Anaarkali of Aarah* and *Pink* highlight this, emphasizing that consensual acts like drinking do not imply consent for sexual assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Even consent given while intoxicated can be grounds for rape charges under Section 63 of the BNS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

The argument that short clothes cause rape is debunked by the fact that young children, older women, or those in traditional attire are also victims of rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Despite its absurdity, a significant portion of society, including women, believes this lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Understanding the Perpetrator: Beyond "Sexual Urge"

A common misconception is that rape is driven by uncontrollable sexual urge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This is often portrayed in old Hindi films where characters justify molestation by a woman's beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. However, sexual urge has nothing to do with rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Many rapists have consenting partners or are married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

Research identifies three primary categories of rapists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>:
1.  **Power Rapists**: Seek to compensate for self-worth issues by exerting control over victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
2.  **Anger Rapists**: Driven by deep-seated anger, they are often abusive and violent, sometimes killing their victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
3.  **Sadistic Rapists**: Derive pleasure from the physical and mental suffering of others, often torturing victims over extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

These evil desires, anger, and sadism often stem from specific root causes observed in offenders' childhoods, such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>:
*   Child abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>
*   Exposure to pornography before age 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>
*   Physical or emotional abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>
*   Parental violence or distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>
*   Cruelty to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>
*   Exposure to violent movies or media in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>

Understanding these factors is crucial for preventing the formation of new rapists in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## Rape Culture: Normalization and Objectification

Rape culture is a global phenomenon where mass media, societal attitudes, and traditions trivialize or normalize rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **Media Portrayal**: Films like *Kambakht Ishq* and *Kabir Singh* depict forced kisses or molestation as comedy or romantic acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. This [[representation_of_violence_and_misogyny_in_films | representation of violence and misogyny in films]] contributes to [[critique_of_violence_in_cinema_and_its_societal_effects | critique of violence in cinema and its societal effects]].
*   **Comedy**: Stand-up comedians, both male and female, use vulgar language and make rape jokes, normalizing sexual violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
*   **Casual Conversations**: Everyday insults often normalize rape culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

This normalization, where people laugh at rape jokes or show no guilt for giving rape threats, is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Psychologist Madhumita Pandey's research with convicted rapists found that unlike murderers, most rapists expressed no regret for their actions, often becoming repeat offenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Their regressive views about women were clearly evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

This phenomenon is further fueled by **toxic masculinity** and **patriarchal culture**, which view women as inferior subhumans or objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Advertising and music contribute significantly to [[misogyny_and_objectification_in_media | misogyny and objectification in media]]:
*   Ranbir Kapoor's "Score More With *** Blast" ad objectifies girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
*   Songs like Kareena Kapoor's "Tandoori Chicken" or Badshah's "I'm the one your mother must be warning you about" glamorize assaulters and normalize toxic masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   The double standard where a man with multiple partners is a "stud" but a woman is a "slut" perpetuates harmful stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

This pervasive objectification and normalization of rape culture, exacerbated by the [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | influence of media on social behavior and norms]], ensures the problem will not be solved unless these underlying issues are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.

## Solutions: A Multifaceted Approach

Tackling the problem of rape requires action on three fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>:

1.  **Address Root Causes**:
    *   Prevent the formation of twisted personalities by tackling childhood abuse and exposure to violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
    *   Government needs to prioritize women's empowerment, education, and improved employment conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
    *   Implement sex education in schools, teaching children about good and bad touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.
    *   Governments must improve legal processes to ensure justice, which can help address [[challenges_faced_by_survivors | challenges faced by survivors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

2.  **Change Societal Attitudes**:
    *   Individuals must commit to eradicating sexist insults and phrases from daily life and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
    *   Rape threats should never be made, regardless of disagreement or hatred for a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
    *   Do not laugh at rape jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
    *   Actively call out sexist attitudes in ads, films, songs, YouTube videos, comments, and stand-up acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

3.  **Improve Material Conditions**:
    *   Strengthen law and order by filling police vacancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
    *   Ensure greater police independence from state governments to prevent political interference in justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

By working together on these solutions, society can spread awareness and collectively address the complex issue of rape and its underlying cultural factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

The arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal marks a significant event in India's political landscape, being the first time a sitting Chief Minister has been arrested in independent India's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This arrest, along with those of other Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders like Manish Sisodia, Satyendra Jain, and Sanjay Singh, occurred without any crime being proven in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Allegations and Counter-Claims

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) claims that AAP leaders received a ₹1 billion bribe in exchange for undue benefits under Delhi's Excise policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. However, AAP politician Atishi stated that despite two years of investigation, over 500 raids, and more than 1,000 witnesses, the ED and CBI have found no evidence to prove wrongdoing by AAP or its ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Manish Sisodia's lawyer argued in the Delhi High Court that there was no money trail and that the policy actually benefited citizens by increasing government revenue for schools and hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)

The lack of bail for arrested AAP leaders is attributed to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), particularly the 2018 amendment by the Modi government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This amendment made bail more difficult to obtain, shifting the legal presumption from "innocent until proven guilty" to "guilty until proven innocent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The amendment also granted the ED increased power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Arvind Kejriwal himself explained before his arrest that under this law, individuals are arrested without proof of accusation and cannot get bail until their case concludes and they are proven innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### Electoral Bonds Connection

Kejriwal's arrest was primarily based on the statements of four individuals, with a key figure being Sarath Chandra Reddy, head of Aurobindo Pharma Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The chronology of events involving Reddy raises questions:
*   November 9, 2022: ED summoned Reddy; his statement favored Kejriwal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   November 10, 2022: ED arrested Reddy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   Five days post-arrest: Aurobindo Pharma donated ₹50 million to the BJP via electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   Reddy gave 9 statements in Kejriwal's favor while in jail for 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   April 25, 2023: After 6 months in jail, his next statement was against Kejriwal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   May 2023: ED granted him bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   June 2023: He became an ED approver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   Six months post-bail: His company made another ₹250 million donation to the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

Aurobindo Pharma bought a total of ₹520 million in electoral bonds, with ₹340 million going to the BJP, ₹150 million to BRS, and ₹25 million to TDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This led Atishi to claim that the money trail of the alleged liquor scam leads to the BJP, not AAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Similar chronologies are noted for the other three individuals whose statements led to Kejriwal's arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. This context led Kejriwal to ignore ED summons, deeming them illegal and aimed at smothering his party and overthrowing his governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

### Broader Implications for [[challenges_to_indian_democracy_and_opposition | Indian Democracy]]

Rahul Gandhi, reacting to Kejriwal's arrest, asserted that "a scared dictator wants to lead a lifeless democracy," citing threats to politicians, overthrowing governments, imprisonment, and freezing opposition party accounts as evidence of "match-fixing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. The Congress party's bank accounts were frozen, with the Income Tax Department citing untimely returns and a 31-year-old case for which a ₹17 billion fine was imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. The Communist Party also received a ₹110 million penalty for using an old PAN card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Similar tactics, such as ED and IT notices, are reportedly targeting opposition candidates as soon as they are declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

This situation has drawn international attention, with Germany, America, and the United Nations expressing hope for free and fair elections and the protection of citizens' rights in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. India's reputation has reportedly declined globally due to the government's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. The Democracy Report 2024 by Sweden's V-Dem Institute categorized India as an "Electoral Autocracy," indicating multi-party elections exist but without a fair playing field and with suppressed freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. The report also notes the Modi government's use of laws like sedition, defamation, and counter-terrorism to suppress dissenting voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

A proposed Broadcasting Services Regulation Bill 2023, with new IT rules, could further restrict freedom of expression online by requiring registration for all broadcasters (including YouTubers, social media users, and WhatsApp channel administrators) and establishing a Central Evaluation Committee with powers to approve content and seize equipment without notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.

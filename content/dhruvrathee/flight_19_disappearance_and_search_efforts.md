## The Fateful Training Mission

On December 5, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, at 2:10 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, five Avenger torpedo bomber aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> of the US Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> departed from Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This mission was designated Flight 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, a routine three-hour training exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The flight consisted of 14 crew members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, led by an experienced pilot and war veteran, Lieutenant Charles Carol Taylor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The five planes initially flew east from Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Malfunctions and Confusion

Initially, conditions were normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> with clear weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, approximately two hours after takeoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, the squadron leader reported sudden compass problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Both their primary and backup compasses failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, making it impossible to determine their actual position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Other pilots in the formation also reported instrument malfunctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

After the compasses failed, confusing messages were transmitted over the radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The weather began to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. At 4:56 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, Taylor believed they were flying over the Gulf of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, needing to fly east to return to Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, some crew members aboard the flight believed they were already east of Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> and needed to fly westward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A radio transmission from one of the planes confirmed this internal disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>:

> "We don't know which way is West." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

The weather continued to deteriorate as sunset approached, giving way to night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. It is now believed the planes were actually 370 kilometers east of Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. At 7:04 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, the last radio transmission from Taylor was received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Disappearance and Search Efforts

After this last contact, all five planes of Flight 19 were lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. To this day, there is no clue as to their location or fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Following the [[disappearance_of_malaysian_airlines_flight_mh370 | disappearance]] of Flight 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, a Mariner [[Search and Rescue Operations | search and rescue]] aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> with a crew of 13 people took off on a mission to find Flight 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Mysteriously, this Mariner aircraft also disappeared while searching for the missing planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

For days afterward, one of the largest air-and-sea [[Search and Rescue Operations | search operations]] of the time was conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> to locate both Flight 19 and the Mariner aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Despite the extensive efforts, no wreckage or bodies were ever found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Everything had vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Connection to the Bermuda Triangle

Interestingly, the area where both Flight 19 and the Mariner aircraft disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> is now known as the Bermuda Triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This incident is a significant part of the lore surrounding the Bermuda Triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Since May 2014, while some have claimed the world began looking up at India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, official global indices and international media paint a different picture of India's standing.

## Development and Social Indices

India's rankings in various global indices show a mixed or declining trend:
*   In the Human Development Index, India's rank was 134 in May 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, and it remained 134th in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   The Global Peace Index ranked India 126th in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, a position it also held in 2023 for the Global Peace Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   In the Global Hunger Index 2023, India's rank dropped to 111th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   The number of people who left Indian citizenship has broken all records, with over 225,000 people renouncing Indian citizenship in 2022 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Approximately 97,000 Indians were arrested trying to enter the US illegally in one year, according to US Customs and Border Protection data from November 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Democracy and Press Freedom

Concerns have also been raised regarding India's democratic health and media freedom:
*   The Press Freedom Index ranked India 159th in 2024, a significant fall compared to its 2014 position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> and again noted as drastically low compared to 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   In the Democracy Index 2023, India fell to the 104th rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   The US is now expressing [[preservation_of_democracy_and_challenges_to_electoral_integrity_in_india | concern about India's democracy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

## International Media Portrayal and [[false_narratives_and_media_portrayal_regarding_indias_global_leadership | False Narratives]]

Despite claims of global praise, international media has published critical assessments of India:
*   In May 2014, it was claimed that "When India speaks, the whole world listens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, a sentiment echoed by several BJP leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This statement was originally said by former US President Barack Obama for Dr. Manmohan Singh, praising his deep understanding of economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The New York Times had to tweet and clarify that a viral image claiming PM Modi was called 'the last hope of the world' was a fake picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   Time Magazine, which published a cover titled 'Why Modi Matters' in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, later published a photo in 2019 with the title "India's Divider in Chief," stating he was ripping apart India's social fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   An Australian newspaper, Herald Sun, published news linking India's PM to a mass rapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   Japan's Nikkei Asia criticized India's PM for his speeches against Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   After 2014, newspapers globally reported on lynchings in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, with CBS News reporting the Palgarh incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, and The New York Times reporting the death of Tabrez Ansari, a Muslim man forced to chant Hindu slogans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## Diplomatic Relations

India's relations with neighboring countries are stated to be at a low point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Controversial statements by BJP leaders Nupur Sharma and Naveen Kumar Jindal led to criticism from Middle East countries, and the United Nations Secretary-General issued instructions on tolerance for all religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Russia sold weapons to Pakistan despite India's objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### Historical Context

Historically, India has commanded significant global respect. In the 1950s, despite being a poor country recently looted by the British, Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru garnered immense global respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. When Nehru visited America in 1949 for his first state visit, US President Harry Truman received him at the airport, and Nehru was honored with a 19-gun salute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. He was similarly welcomed in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

This global influence was attributed to Nehru's leadership in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which provided a third path during the Cold War, rejecting alignment with either the Western or Eastern blocs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. NAM, founded in 1961, now includes 120 countries and remains relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Nehru also openly spoke against apartheid in Africa and established scholarships for African students, many of whom later became leaders in their own countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

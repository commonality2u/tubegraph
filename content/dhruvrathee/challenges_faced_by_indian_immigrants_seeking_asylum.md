Indian immigrants, often driven by the pursuit of better economic opportunities or a better life, frequently resort to perilous and illegal means to enter countries like the United States, commonly known as the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_India | 'donkey process']] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This method, involving backdoor illegal entry without a legal visa, carries significant [[Challenges Faced by Survivors | challenges]] and dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Each year, thousands of Indians attempt this journey, with many losing their lives in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Perilous Journeys and Fatalities
The [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_India | 'donkey process']] often involves crossing dangerous terrain and enduring extreme weather conditions. The US-Mexico border is recognized as the world's most dangerous border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Northern Route: US-Canada Border
The northern US-Canada border can experience temperatures as low as -35°C to -40°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
A tragic example is the Patel family from Dingucha village in Gujarat, who in January 2022, paid ₹6.5 million to an agent to be taken to America via the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_India | 'donkey process']] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Their journey involved flying to Toronto, then traveling to Manitoba province, and finally being dropped near Emerson, Canada, close to the US border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. They were expected to walk the remaining distance across the American border illegally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Within a week of their arrival in Toronto, the family of four, including two children, died from exposure to the freezing weather, just 12 meters from the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Southern Route: US-Mexico Border
The southern US-Mexico border poses even greater dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This route often begins in Ecuador or Brazil, where obtaining visas is easier for Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. From there, migrants embark on an extensive journey north through Colombia and Panama to Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

A significant obstacle is the Darien Gap, a dense jungle over 100 kilometers wide with no roads, only mountains, forests, and rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This area lacks government authority and is considered one of the most dangerous places globally due to the presence of drug cartels and guerrilla groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Individuals often fall victim to gang violence, with cases of "donkers" (agents involved in transporting individuals) killing travelers if their full payment is not received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. After surviving the jungle, migrants face Mexico's scorching desert and the imposing border wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. In 2021 alone, over 650 people died attempting to cross the US-Mexico border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Exploitation by Visa Agencies
[[Role of visa agencies in illegal immigration | Numerous visa agencies and companies]] in India facilitate the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_India | 'donkey process']] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Gujarat, Punjab, and more recently, Haryana, are known as primary exporters of illegal immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. These agencies charge exorbitant fees, ranging from ₹2.5 million to ₹6 million, depending on the "package" chosen, which may include forging fake documents or simply dropping individuals near the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Victims often sell their farms, homes, or deplete life savings to raise these sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Agencies frequently mislead applicants with false promises of smooth journeys and abundant job opportunities, concealing the real [[Challenges Faced by Survivors | challenges]] and legal hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Reasons for Choosing the 'Donkey Process'
Three main reasons drive individuals to choose this perilous path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### 1. Economic Opportunities
The primary motivation is the pursuit of economic opportunities and a better life, fueled by the "American Dream" and success stories of others who have settled abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Lower-middle-class individuals often lack the financial resources or educational qualifications for legal immigration routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### 2. Rising Unemployment
High unemployment rates in India, particularly in states like Haryana (37.3% unemployed in September 2022, four times the national average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, push people to sell family land and gold to fund this risky endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Frustration with joblessness and entrance exam paper leaks also contribute to this desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

### 3. Escaping Political Persecution and Discrimination
While economic reasons are prevalent, the most commonly reported reason to Border Patrol is seeking asylum due to political persecution, oppression, or discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Asylum is a form of protection granted by a country to individuals facing danger in their home country, which can include political, religious, racial, caste-based, or social group discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

A notable example is Jashanpreet Singh, a 24-year-old openly gay man from Jalandhar, who faced severe discrimination and physical attacks in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Due to the less open-minded Indian culture regarding LGBT+ issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, he chose the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_India | 'donkey route']] through Turkey and France to reach the Mexican border, ultimately entering America and being granted asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Asylum is granted only to individuals physically present in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

## The Asylum Process and Its [[Challenges Faced by Survivors | Challenges]]
After crossing the border, most individuals willingly surrender to Border Patrol to seek asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. They must present their case in immigration court, providing justification and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. It is crucial to prove that the claims are genuine, as lying can lead to deportation and a ban from future legal travel to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Economic migration does not qualify for asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

Asylum applications can take months or even years of investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. During this period, individuals are often placed in detention centers with terrible conditions, confined for weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Even after living in America for years, there is a risk of deportation if authorities decide the asylum claims were false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

Given the inherent dangers, the risks associated with the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_India | 'donkey process']] often outweigh the potential benefits, making it an extremely risky path for those seeking a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

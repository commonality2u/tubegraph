Recent incidents highlight the fervent support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, often irrespective of logical reasoning or personal hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. In Karnataka, a man named Arun Warniker cut his finger while offering his bl00d to Goddess Kali for PM Modi's victory and had previously built a temple for Modi in his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Other supporters express unwavering loyalty, stating they would vote for the BJP even if the candidate were a dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These individuals identify as "devotees" rather than superstitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

This extreme devotion extends to accepting high prices, with supporters willing to pay ₹5,000 for a cylinder and ₹500 per litre for petrol, acknowledging Modi's inability to control prices, yet still pledging their vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Some supporters struggle to list any of Modi's achievements when challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, or make personal sacrifices like not wearing vests or having torn underwear, while still affirming their vote for Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This phenomenon has been described as a state where millions of citizens have been "br@inwashed," refusing to use their brains despite education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## The "WhatsApp University" Phenomenon

The primary driver of this widespread "br@inwashing" is identified as "WhatsApp University" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. While pro-government TV anchors and YouTubers contribute to the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, "WhatsApp University" is deemed to bear the biggest responsibility due to its "different level" of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Messages circulated on WhatsApp are not only false but often "ten times more dangerous" than traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This platform operates as an "organised m@fia," a system run from the backend to "br@inwash" people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Media Accountability vs. WhatsApp Anonymity

Traditional pro-government anchors, despite their efforts to spread [[fake_news_in_indian_media|fake news]] and hatred, are limited by the fear of police cases and FIRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Aman Chopra (News18)**: Faced FIRs for spreading [[fake_news_in_indian_media|fake news]] about a temple demolition in Rajasthan, falsely linking it to a mosque demolition in Jahangirpuri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Arnab Goswami (Republic TV)**: An FIR was filed against him for "shamelessly" spreading the lie on his channel that sadhus l!nched in Palghar were k!lled by Ms, despite official clarification that no Ms were among the arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Amish Devgan (News18)**: Faced an FIR and Supreme Court trial for using "vile language" against Sufi saint Khawaja Moinuddin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Sudhir Chaudhary (Zee News)**: Faced an FIR for attempting to show a false "Jih@d" flowchart from WhatsApp University on his TV program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

These media figures are "constantly worried about fact-checking and FIRs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, which limits their reach compared to WhatsApp. In contrast, those running the "dangerous m@fia on WhatsApp University" operate without fear because messages are forwarded countless times, making the original source untraceable for legal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. While the government *could* track sources (as seen in the case of Mohammad Azam's lynching due to a fake child kidnapper message, where a WhatsApp group admin was arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>), it often does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### BJP IT Cell's Role
The "problem" is attributed to the BJP IT cell itself running this "WhatsApp m@fia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. An employee of the BJP IT cell interviewed by a Singapore news channel stated that there is a team dedicated to commenting and defaming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This "m@fia" is reportedly "operated directly from the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

An example given is the promotion of the [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film|propaganda film]] *The Kerala Story*, which falsely claimed 32,000 Hindu and Christian girls from Kerala joined I$!S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Despite filmmakers admitting they had no sources and the real figure was only 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, and the Supreme Court directing a disclaimer that the film is a fictionalised account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, PM Modi still promoted it in an election speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Home Minister Amit Shah also praised the BJP IT cell's ability to "spread any lie all over the country" by creating 3.2 million WhatsApp groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:00]</a>.

## The Four Departments of Brainwashing (Modi's Cult of Personality)
The "WhatsApp m@fia" operates through four main departments, primarily targeting Hindus, especially upper caste Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The strategy is to control the majority community to establish a d!ctatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

1.  **Racial or Religious Pride**: Initial messages focus on pride in Hindu r@ce, history, and culture, claiming greatness and superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
2.  **Victimisation and Self-Pity**: After instilling pride, messages portray Hindus as victims who have been "t0rtured for centuries" and prevented from succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
3.  **"You are in danger"**: This department asserts that Hindus are still in danger, facing threats from people of other religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. All anti-BJP individuals and opposition parties (Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, Left-wing, Urban Naxal, George Soros), as well as foreign entities (Pakistan, China, USA, Russia, international agencies), are depicted as being against Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
4.  **Modi's Cult of Personality**: Once fear is ingrained, PM Modi is presented as the sole "lord and saviour," a non-human, Krishna and Ram incarnate, who will save Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Before elections, messages intensify, claiming that voting for BJP is necessary to "save Hindus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

This process involves an "emotional roller coaster" of pride, arrogance, self-pity, hatred, and fear, leading to a "mental sl@ve" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### Historical Parallels
This brainwashing strategy is compared to that used by German d!ctator H, who targeted ethnic German Aryans, the majority community, by creating false fear about Js, blaming them for national problems, declaring them a threat, and presenting himself as the "Supreme Leader" and "God incarnate" who would save them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Similarly, Pakistani d!ctator Zia-ul-Haq targeted Sunni Ms, the majority community, spreading hatred against minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Debunking Pseudo-Scientific Claims
The "WhatsApp University" propagates pseudo-scientific claims under the guise of religious pride, while ignoring genuine scientific achievements and traditional spiritual meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. They prioritize religious stories and mythology over inspiring figures like Aryabhatta or Rishi Charak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

Examples of such claims include:
*   **Hawan produces oxygen**: It is falsely claimed that ritual burning of 10 grams of cow ghee produces one tonne of oxygen, despite basic chemistry indicating combustion consumes oxygen and releases carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Cows exhale oxygen**: This claim is also propagated without evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
*   **Cow urine cures lung infection**: Claimed by figures like Pragya Thakur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
*   **Toe rings and health benefits**: False "scientific reasons" are given for wearing toe rings, such as a nerve from the heart to the second toe related to the uterus, increasing fertility, and reducing uterine/heart diseases, or controlling blood pressure and menstrual cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. These claims contradict basic biology and are not supported by scientific studies or ancient texts like the Vedas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   **Tilak and trigeminal nerve**: It is falsely claimed that applying tilak presses the trigeminal nerve, clearing sinuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. However, the trigeminal nerve endpoints are on the eyebrows, cheeks, and chin, not the forehead, and pressing these points does not clear sinuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. The true meaning of tilak is a religious and cultural tradition with spiritual significance, such as remembering Trimurti or three realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

This focus on pseudo-science fosters a mindset where people are discouraged from using their brains, asking questions, or verifying information, leading to uncritical acceptance of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. While such claims are spread, the government's budget for Research and Development remains low, only 0.65% of GDP in 2021, compared to countries like Israel (5.55%) and South Korea (4.93%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## Consequences of Misinformation
This continuous influx of misinformation ensures unwavering support for Modi, regardless of challenges such as high petrol and cylinder prices, unemployment, ongoing conflicts (e.g., Manipur), environmental damage (e.g., Hasdeo forest), or economic issues like India's debt reaching ₹20.5 Trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. The "WhatsApp m@fia" has turned people into "mental sl@ves," making them believe that only Modi can save them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

## Combating Misinformation
A plan is proposed to counter this "WhatsApp University" and "destroy this m@fia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. With an estimated 10,000 people in BJP's IT cell running this operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>, a collective effort of over 15 million people is suggested to spread truth and save the country's democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

The steps include:
1.  Joining a WhatsApp channel for daily messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
2.  Forwarding these messages to 100 contacts each, aiming for 1 Billion messages daily to "wipe out" the WhatsApp m@fia within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
3.  Downloading the Dhruv Rathee app as a backup for continued communication if YouTube or WhatsApp channels are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
4.  Making 1-minute videos debunking lies and sharing them on social media with the hashtag #Mission100Crore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.
5.  Emphasizing the crucial importance of voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

The goal is to reach all 1 billion voters in the country to protect the Constitution and democracy, and to free people from "mental sl@very" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

Recent events surrounding the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) have brought the pervasive issue of paper leaks and misconduct in Indian examinations to national attention, raising concerns about the integrity of the education system and the future of students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This problem extends beyond a single exam, affecting millions of job seekers annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Widespread Nature of Exam Fraud

Paper leaks and general misconduct in exams have become "quite common" in India over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. An investigation by the Indian Express revealed 41 paper leaks in the last five years alone, impacting the lives of 14 million job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Examples of Leaks and Rackets

*   **Patna Police Arrests:** Shortly after the NEET exam, Patna police arrested 13 individuals for leaking exam papers, reportedly charging students ₹3 million to ₹5 million for leaked papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Gujarat Racket:** On May 10, an entire racket was uncovered in Gujarat, involving an education consultancy owner, a school teacher, and a BJP leader, who allegedly charged students ₹1 million for assistance in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Multiple States:** News of paper leaks from various states, including Gujarat, Bihar, and Odisha, emerged even after the NEET exam was conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

The results of the NEET pre-medical exam, declared on June 4, have sparked nationwide commotion due to "unbelievable irregularities" and what is being called a "large-scale scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The exam, officially known as the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test for Undergraduates (NEET-UG), is the sole undergraduate admission exam for all medical, dental, and AYUSH courses in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Evolution of NEET and [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | National Testing Agency (NTA)]]

NEET was introduced in 2013 to replace various state and medical college pre-medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. After initial protests from several states, the first NEET exam was conducted in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
Initially overseen by CBSE for its first three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, the responsibility shifted to the [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | National Testing Agency (NTA)]] after 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The NTA, an autonomous agency established in November 2017 under the Ministry of Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, was intended to bring independence and transparency to exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. However, public anger is now directed at the NTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Anomalies in NEET 2024

*   **Registration Window Extensions:** The registration deadline, initially set for March 9, was extended for a week, and then the link was mysteriously reopened from April 9 to April 10 at the request of "stakeholders," followed by a correction window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The identity of these "stakeholders" remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Unprecedented Perfect Scores:** In 2024, an astonishing 67 students achieved a perfect score of 720 out of 720, all receiving All India Rank 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This contrasts sharply with previous years: only 2 perfect scores in 2023, 0 perfect scores (highest 715) in 2022, and 3 perfect scores in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### NTA's Explanations and Criticisms

The NTA offered three reasons for the high number of perfect scores, all of which faced criticism:

1.  **"Easy Exam":** An NTA official claimed the 2024 exam was "very easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, students and experts had predicted the exam to be "very tough" before results, expecting average scores to drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Higher Candidate Numbers:** The NTA stated that 300,000 more candidates appeared than in 2023, leading to "naturally" higher scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
3.  **Grace Marks:** Most controversially, the NTA admitted that 50 of the 67 toppers received grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
    *   **Answer Key Discrepancies:** 44 students received grace marks due to "discrepancies in the answer keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. For example, a physics question had two correct answers because it appeared differently in old and new NCERT textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The NTA chose to mark a wrong answer as correct based on a 2018 NCERT textbook edition, despite later editions correcting the statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   **Time-Related Issues:** The remaining 6 toppers, along with 1,563 other students, received grace marks due to "time-related issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Notably, two students scored 718 or 719, which is mathematically impossible under normal scoring rules (+4 for correct, -1 for incorrect, implying scores must be multiples of 5 relative to 720) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. These two students were from the same Jhajjar Centre as the other 6 toppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
    *   **Inappropriate Legal Precedent:** To justify the grace marks for time loss, the NTA cited a 2018 Supreme Court judgment for the CLAT exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. However, this judgment explicitly states it cannot be applied to "Medical and Engineering" exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Critics question the formula used, the exact number of grace marks allotted, and why the exam time wasn't simply extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

*   **OMR Sheet Discrepancies:** Many students reported significant differences between their OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) answer sheets' estimated scores and their final scorecards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. For instance, an 18-year-old student named Arshita saw her score drop from an expected 384 to 308 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Suspicious Result Declaration Timing:** The NEET results were declared on June 4, 10 days earlier than scheduled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, coinciding with the declaration of the [[election_fraud_and_irregularities_in_india | 2024 Election results]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This timing raised suspicions of an attempt to "cover up a scam amidst the ruckus of the elections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Responses and Demands for Accountability

The widespread irregularities have led to significant backlash and demands for action:

*   **Supreme Court Intervention:** The Supreme Court has intervened, stating, "The sanctity of the exam has been affected, so we need answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Political Opposition:** Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, Sanjay Singh, Akhilesh Yadav, and M.K. Stalin, are demanding an investigation and have pledged to raise the issue in Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Education Panel:** Under increasing pressure, the [[role_of_indian_government_and_education_ministry_in_exam_management | Ministry of Education]] announced on June 8 that it would establish a four-member panel to examine the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Student Protests and Petitions:** Protests have erupted across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, and over 40,000 students have signed petitions demanding that the NEET exam be conducted again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **NTA's Stance:** Despite the evidence, the NTA continues to claim that the "integrity" of the exam has "not been compromised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### Criticism of the Education Minister

Dharmendra Pradhan, the current [[role_of_indian_government_and_education_ministry_in_exam_management | Education Minister]], has faced criticism for his apparent lack of focus on educational issues. His social media presence is described as being "less of an Education Minister, and more of Narendra Modi's PR Minister," with minimal content related to education or the NEET exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Impact and Future Outlook

The continuous occurrences of exam fraud raise critical questions about the future of India's youth and its foundational systems. This directly impacts the [[effects_of_exam_fraud_on_students_and_education_system | effects of exam fraud on students and education system]], affecting students' mental health and trust in the system. Over 13,000 students reportedly committed suicide in 2022 due to depression related to the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### Latest Update

As a partial resolution to the grace marks issue, the NTA has agreed to remove the grace marks given to 1,563 candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. These candidates now have the option to either retake the exam or accept their original scores without the added grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. However, major issues like paper leaks, inflated scores, and multiple toppers from the same centre remain unaddressed by the NTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

> "Our hearts break when we see the students' videos. They have played a dirty trick with the students from all over the country. Students did their best in the exam." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

The integrity of examinations is crucial for the future of the country, ensuring that students who study hard have a fair chance at a bright future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Holding leaders accountable and demanding transparency are essential steps to finding solutions to such mismanagement and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

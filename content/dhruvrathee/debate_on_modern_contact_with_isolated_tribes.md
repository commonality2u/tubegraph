The question of whether to establish modern contact with [[uncontacted_tribes_and_their_isolation | isolated tribes]] like the North Sentinelese is a subject of ongoing debate, with significant arguments for and against intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Case Study: The North Sentinelese

The North Sentinelese are believed to be the world's last [[uncontacted_tribes_and_their_isolation | uncontacted tribe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They live on North Sentinel Island, a small island of 60 kmÂ² covered by dense forest in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. They are considered direct descendants of people who migrated out of Africa approximately 70,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It is believed they have been isolated on this island for 10,000 to 30,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This isolation means they have never learned agriculture, still living a Stone Age hunter-gatherer lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### John Allen Chau Incident

In November 2018, American missionary John Allen Chau illegally went to North Sentinel Island, intending to teach Christianity to the Sentinelese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He bribed a fisherman to drop him off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. On his first attempt on November 15, 2018, he encountered two Sentinelese men with bows and arrows who prepared to shoot him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Later that day, he tried again, and a child shot an arrow that hit his Bible, sparing his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Despite writing in his diary, "I don't want to die," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> he returned on November 16, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. He was killed by the Sentinelese, and his body was seen being buried by local fishermen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Arguments for Establishing Contact

Some argue that [[efforts_to_contact_north_sentinel_island_and_their_impact | efforts to contact isolated tribes]] should continue to introduce them to the modern world and its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
Proponents suggest:
*   Sharing technologies and innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   Bringing development and modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

## Arguments Against Establishing Contact

Conversely, many argue for protecting [[uncontacted_tribes_and_their_isolation | isolated tribes]] from the outside world, allowing them to remain in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The primary reasons cited include:

### Vulnerability to Disease
[[Uncontacted tribes and their isolation | Isolated tribes]] have no immunity to common diseases carried by outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Historical incidents, such as British officer Maurice Vidal Portman kidnapping six Sentinelese individuals in 1880, resulted in two of them dying quickly in Port Blair, likely due to unfamiliar diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Returning the surviving children to the island likely introduced foreign germs, potentially causing widespread illness and death within the tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
In 2004, after the Indian Ocean Tsunami, Indian Coast Guard officials observed the Sentinelese firing arrows at their helicopter, which confirmed they were alright, as any contact could transmit disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Negative Impact on Other Tribes
Past [[efforts to contact North Sentinel Island and their impact | attempts to contact and integrate other tribes]] in the Andaman Islands have shown negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

*   **Jarawa Tribe**: While initial friendly contact with the Jarawa tribe in the 1970s was successful, their subsequent exposure to modern society led to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Some tribe members struggled to digest packaged foods and became obese due to lack of portion control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The introduction of tobacco and alcohol led to instant addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Great Andamanese Tribe**: When the British colonized the islands in the 1800s, the Great Andamanese Tribe numbered around 5,000 individuals; today, only 41 members remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. This drastic decline is attributed to contact with outsiders.

### Loss of Culture and Lifestyle
Integration into modern society often leads to the loss of a tribe's unique culture, lifestyle, language, and traditions, which have been preserved for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

### Sentinelese Desire for Isolation
The North Sentinelese have consistently shown hostility towards outsiders.
*   In 1867, survivors of a shipwreck near the island were attacked by the Sentinelese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   In 1974, an Indian film crew making a documentary was attacked with arrows; one hit the director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. They also killed and buried a live pig left as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   Friendly contact in 1991, led by anthropologist Madhumala Chattopadhyay, saw the Sentinelese accept coconuts and allow team members on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. However, this was a rare occurrence, and [[efforts to contact North Sentinel Island and their impact | subsequent expeditions]] after 1991 faced violence again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   In 2006, two local fishermen were killed by the Sentinelese after their boat drifted too close to the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

### Sustainable Living
The Sentinelese demonstrate sustainable living on their small island, coexisting harmoniously with nature without deforestation or overpopulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. They do not farm but hunt wild boars, fish, harvest turtle eggs, and gather fruits, flowers, and honey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Their ability to live sustainably without depleting resources is contrasted with the tendencies of most human communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### Government Policy
After 1997, the Indian government banned people from visiting North Sentinel Island, adopting an "Eyes-On, Hands-Off" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This policy dictates monitoring the tribe for assistance needs but avoiding direct intervention, respecting their desire for isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Currently, a 5 km exclusion zone around the island is enforced to prevent accidental contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

Ultimately, [[efforts to contact North Sentinel Island and their impact | attempts to establish contact]] with [[uncontacted_tribes_and_their_isolation | isolated tribes]] like the North Sentinelese carry significant risks, potentially leading to the eradication of their entire community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

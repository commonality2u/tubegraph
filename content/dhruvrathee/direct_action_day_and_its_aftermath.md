A year before India's independence, the entire nation witnessed a "riveting political game of thrones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Mahatma Gandhi was so desperate to prevent the partition of India that he even suggested to Lord Mountbatten that Muhammad Ali Jinnah be made the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This period, particularly after 1946, saw Jinnah accumulate significant political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The "Direct Action Day" incident was merely the beginning of many more riots that would precede the partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. By the time the violence subsided, Calcutta had tragically transformed into "a city of corpses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Background to Independence and Political Climate (1946)

In 1946, the whole country was in turmoil as it became clear the British were preparing to leave India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The question was not *if* India would be free, but *when* and *how* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Several factors contributed to this impending freedom:
*   **Quit India Movement (1942)**: Millions of Indians protested the British government under Gandhi's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **Indian National Army (1944-45)**: Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's struggle and the subsequent Red Fort Trials significantly shocked the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.
*   **Royal Navy Mutiny**: Indian soldiers of the British Navy revolted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.
*   **Second World War**: The war left Britain with heavy unemployment, economic recession, and an uncertain treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.
*   **British Political Shift**: After the 1945 elections, Clement Attlee became the new Prime Minister in the UK, and his party had promised India its freedom in their manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>.

### Provincial Elections and the Rise of the Muslim League

Under the Government of India Act 1935, Indian provinces were granted autonomy, and elected legislators and Indian ministers were introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:38">[03:38:38]</a>. The first provincial elections were held in 1937, where Congress won in 7 out of 11 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:10">[04:10:10]</a>. Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Muslim League faced losses, winning only 22% of the reserved Muslim seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:04">[05:04:04]</a>.

However, the next provincial elections in 1946 (delayed by World War II and the Quit India Movement) told a different story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:13">[05:13:13]</a>. By this time, the communal divide between Hindus and Muslims was significant, partly due to politicians like Jinnah using "provocative speeches to incite fear among people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:22">[05:22:22]</a>.

In the 1946 elections, the Muslim League won 2 out of 11 provinces (Bengal and Sindh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:51">[05:51:51]</a>, and most significantly, secured 87% of all reserved Muslim seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>. This meant Jinnah suddenly accumulated a "lot of political power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:25">[06:25:25]</a>, forcing the British to negotiate with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:29">[06:29:29]</a>. Jinnah now demanded a separate country, Pakistan, while the Congress Party leaders were against partition, advocating for a united India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:41">[06:41:41]</a>.

### Jinnah's Evolution

Interestingly, Jinnah had been a member of the Congress Party 26 years prior, advocating for Hindus and Muslims to live together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:55">[06:55:55]</a>. His family even had Hindu origins a few generations ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:13">[07:13:13]</a>. Disagreements with Gandhi's civil disobedience style and "pseudo-religious approach" led him to leave Congress around 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:37">[07:37:37]</a>. By the mid-1930s, after a period in London, Jinnah returned a "completely different person," declaring himself "the only spokesperson of Muslims in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:34">[08:34:34]</a> and campaigning for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:46">[08:46:46]</a>.

## Cabinet Mission Plan (May 1946)

In March 1946, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee sent the Cabinet Mission to India to negotiate for independence with Congress and Muslim League leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Their key objectives included:
1.  **Re-establishing the Viceroy's Executive Council**: Viceroy Wavell proposed Indians fill all but two positions, but Jinnah demanded the exclusive right for the Muslim League to appoint all Muslim members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:19">[09:19:19]</a>.
2.  **Drafting a new constitution**: This led to the formation of the Constituent Assembly of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:44">[09:44:44]</a>.
3.  **Framework for India's post-British future**: This was the most crucial objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:55">[09:55:55]</a>.

On May 16, 1946, the Cabinet Mission proposed a "United India," divided into three groups of provinces: Section A (Hindu majority), Section B (Muslim majority in North-West), and Section C (Muslim majority in East) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:04">[10:04:04]</a>. The Central government would have limited powers, handling only defence, external affairs, and communications, with other powers distributed among the provincial groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:39">[10:39:39]</a>. Jinnah accepted this plan, as it offered significant autonomy to Muslim-dominated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:53">[10:53:53]</a>.

However, Congress initially rejected the plan, advocating for a truly united India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:07">[11:07:07]</a>. Pandit Nehru, then Congress President, agreed to join the Constituent Assembly but stated at a press conference on July 10, 1946, that Congress retained the right to change the Cabinet Mission Plan if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:34">[11:34:34]</a>. This statement proved to be a "huge mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:32">[11:32:32]</a>.

## Direct Action Day: The Call for "Division or Destruction"

Upon reading Nehru's statement, Jinnah felt it was a plan to force Congress's ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:51">[11:51:51]</a>. He immediately rejected the Cabinet Mission Plan and refused to work with Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:58">[11:58:58]</a>. On July 29, 1946, Jinnah announced that the Muslim League was preparing for a struggle, declaring that if Muslims weren't given a separate nation (Pakistan), they would launch "Direct Action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:06">[12:06:06]</a>.

The following day, July 30, Jinnah declared **August 16, 1946**, as the **Direct Action Day** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:21">[12:21:21]</a>. He warned Congress, stating, "India would either be divided or destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:32">[12:32:32]</a>.

### The Violence in Calcutta

The epicentre of Direct Action Day was Bengal, where the Muslim League held the most political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:43">[12:43:43]</a>. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, then Chief Minister of Bengal, now known as the "Butcher of Bengal," gave "free rein to the orthodox, unemployed, frustrated, brainwashed, and anti-social elements on the streets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:59">[12:59:59]</a>. The police were instructed to support the populist movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:25">[13:25:25]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>
> "By the time the massacre was over, Calcutta had become a city of corpses."

Between August 16 and 19, 1946, around 6,000 people were killed and 15,000 injured in Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:34">[13:34:34]</a>. These riots were only the beginning; many more would follow before the partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:42">[13:42:42]</a>.

## Aftermath: Interim Government and Continued Riots

In the horrifying fallout of Direct Action Day, Viceroy Wavell invited Nehru and Congress to form the interim government on August 6, 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:50">[13:50:50]</a>. Despite attempts to bridge gaps, Jinnah's condition that only the Muslim League nominate Muslim members was unacceptable to Congress, a secular party with both Hindu and Muslim leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:54">[14:54:54]</a>.

On September 2, 1946, the interim government took office, with two Muslim members to be appointed later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:07">[16:07:07]</a>. Facing the prospect of losing all rights to nominate Muslim members, Jinnah eventually agreed on October 15, 1946, for the Muslim League to join the interim government without conditions, though he nominated Liaquat Ali Khan instead of joining himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:09">[17:09:09]</a>.

### Deterioration and Further Violence

Despite the formation of the interim government, cooperation between Congress and the Muslim League became increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:59">[17:59:59]</a>. The main reason was the unrelenting Hindu-Muslim riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:16">[18:16:16]</a>.

Just weeks after the interim government formed, a large-scale riot erupted in **Noakhali**, eastern Bengal, on October 10, 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:24">[18:24:24]</a>. This Muslim-majority area, economically dependent on Hindu moneylenders, saw intensified hatred after the Calcutta riots. Armed mobs looted, burned, killed, and forced conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:53">[18:53:53]</a>. Chief Minister Suhrawardy acknowledged the forced conversions but took no steps to stop the violence or visit the affected areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:04">[19:04:04]</a>.

Mahatma Gandhi was deeply saddened by these events and visited Noakhali from November 1946 to February 1947, walking barefoot across 47 villages to promote communal unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:23">[19:23:23]</a>. He sought out Hindu and Muslim leaders in each village, convincing them to live together and become "guarantor[s] of peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:01">[20:01:01]</a>. Gandhi believed that if people came together, partition would not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:56">[20:56:56]</a>. While his efforts did eventually end the riots in Bengal a few months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:31">[21:31:31]</a>, he was only one man.

On October 24, 1946, Hindus in Bihar began retaliating for the Noakhali incidents, and similar situations arose in the United Provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:41">[21:41:41]</a>. The "eye for an eye ideology" was "making our nation blind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:51">[21:51:51]</a>.

## The Road to Partition

By March 1947, the Muslim League successfully overthrew the coalition government in Punjab, a province crucial for the formation of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:10">[22:10:10]</a>. Despite the overthrow, the Muslim League could not form its own government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:31">[22:31:31]</a>. Riots erupted in Rawalpindi and later Lahore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:22">[22:22:22]</a>.

Frustrated by the ongoing riots, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten as India's last Viceroy on March 22, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:05">[23:05:05]</a>. Mountbatten initially sought a united India, but Jinnah rejected his proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:26">[23:26:26]</a>.

Meanwhile, Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel grew "completely fed up with Jinnah's demands," as the Muslim League interfered with nearly every decision of the interim government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:46">[23:46:46]</a>. They reluctantly agreed to the idea of an independent Pakistan, believing that continued work under such circumstances would lead to the nation's doom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:10">[24:10:10]</a>.

Mahatma Gandhi, however, was still trying his utmost to prevent partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:31">[24:31:31]</a>. On April 1, 1947, he requested Mountbatten not to divide India, even suggesting that Jinnah be made the Prime Minister to keep the country united <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:37">[24:37:37]</a>. Mountbatten agreed, provided Gandhi could convince Congress. Despite Gandhi's confidence in Nehru and Patel, they refused to accept Jinnah as Prime Minister, having witnessed his actions in the interim government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:34:34">[26:34:34]</a>. This was a painful moment for Gandhi, as his long-time followers chose a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:02">[27:02:02]</a>.

With everyone now accepting partition, Mountbatten prepared a new "Dickie Bird Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:18">[27:18:18]</a>. This plan initially allowed provinces to join India, Pakistan, or remain independent, which Nehru vehemently opposed, fearing the "Balkanisation" of India into "500 fragments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:32">[27:32:32]</a>. VP Menon, a political commission, then swiftly prepared a new partition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>.

This final plan, accepted by all leaders on June 3, 1947, stipulated the transfer of power to two independent British Dominions: India and Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19:19">[29:19:19]</a>. Provinces would be divided based on elected representatives, with Bengal and Punjab split into two parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:25">[29:25:25]</a>. Princely states were advised to choose either India or Pakistan based on geographical contiguity, with minimal autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:44">[29:44:44]</a>.

On August 15, 1947, at midnight, Pandit Nehru hoisted the Indian flag, and India gained its freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:06">[31:06:06]</a>.

### Consequences of Partition

The partition that followed was devastating:
*   Approximately 15 million people migrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:24">[31:24:24]</a>.
*   More than 1 million people were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:30">[31:30:30]</a>.
*   Forced religious conversions occurred overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:32:32">[31:32:32]</a>.
*   More than 75,000 women were kidnapped and raped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:36">[31:36:36]</a>.

This period led to the arduous task of Sardar Patel tirelessly working to unite all the princely states into the new Indian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:41">[31:41:41]</a>.

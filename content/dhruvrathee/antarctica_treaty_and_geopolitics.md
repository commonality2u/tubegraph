Antarctica stands out as the only continent that is not a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>, lacks a government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"></a>, and has no indigenous tribal populations living there for ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06"></a>. This unique status is largely due to its extreme climate; it is the coldest continent, with temperatures dropping as low as -89Â°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14"></a>, and also the windiest place on Earth, experiencing snowstorms at speeds of 300 km/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18"></a>. Surprisingly, it is also the world's driest continent, considered a desert with only about 51mm of rain, which turns to snow before reaching the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>. Consequently, Antarctica has seen little to no human influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a>, yet various countries have attempted to claim its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a>.

## Early Conceptions and Exploration

The concept of a southern landmass dates back to around 350 BC, when the Greek philosopher Aristotle suggested the Earth was spherical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55"></a>. Aware of the Arctic regions in the North, which they called 'Arctos' (derived from the Great Bear constellation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03"></a>, the Greeks theorized a mirror image in the South. They named this unknown southern region 'Antarctos', meaning "antithetical to the bear" or "opposite of Arctos," from which the name "Antarctic" was derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21"></a>.

Though humans first stepped on Antarctica in the 1890s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36"></a>, the continent began appearing on maps hundreds of years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41"></a>. French explorers included Antarctica on a world map in 1530 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59"></a>, depicting a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere named "Terra Australis Incognita," meaning "Unknown Southern Land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09"></a>.

In 1773, British Naval officer James Cook became the first person to cross the Antarctic Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18"></a>. Although he turned back about 130 km from Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27"></a>, his sighting of icebergs with rock deposits confirmed his belief in the existence of Terra Australis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34"></a>. Cook famously declared that no one would go further south than he had, believing the area too perilous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43"></a>.

His words were disproven 50 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04"></a>. The first undisputed landing on Antarctica occurred in 1895, when the Norwegian ship *Antarctic* reached its shores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21"></a>. Crew members Carsten Borchgrevink and Alexander disputed who was the first to step onto the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35"></a>. The subsequent two decades of the 1900s were known as the "Heroic years of Antarctica," marked by numerous expeditions, [[scientific_research_and_discoveries_in_antarctica | scientific discoveries]], and the first findings of plants like mosses growing on the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12"></a>.

## [[historical_claims_and_exploration_of_antarctica | Historical Claims and Exploration of Antarctica]]

Following this heroic era, the "Colonial period of Antarctica" began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30"></a>, during which seven countries claimed sovereignty over the continent between 1908 and 1942: Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35"></a>. Other nations, including the USA, the Soviet Union, Japan, Sweden, Belgium, and Germany, conducted explorations without claiming territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50"></a>. Notably, under Hitler's rule in 1939, a German Antarctic Expedition flew over parts of the continent, dropping metal Nazi Swastikas to assert claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01"></a>.

The USA's official position, announced in 1924, was that discovering new land did not grant ownership unless permanent settlements were established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21"></a>. After World War II, the claimant countries intensified their assertions, not through warfare but by establishing permanent research centers to demonstrate continuous presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49"></a>. Australia set up stations on Heard and Macquarie Islands in 1947-48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21"></a>, and on mainland Antarctica at Mawson Station in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34"></a>. France established bases on Kerguelen and Crozet Islands in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27"></a>, and Argentina set up the General Belgrano Station in 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42"></a>.

These research stations became a political strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03"></a>. The close proximity of British, Chilean, and Argentinian bases clearly indicated their purpose was more than just [[scientific_research_and_discoveries_in_antarctica | scientific research]], suggesting intelligence activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08"></a>. The territorial claims of these seven countries often overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24"></a>. While Norway, Australia, France, and New Zealand have clearly demarcated, non-overlapping claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38"></a>, the claims of Chile, Britain, and Argentina significantly overlap, with Chile's claims encompassing British and Argentinian territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48"></a>.

In 1950, the Soviet Union declared that it would not recognize any claims or decisions regarding Antarctica made without its participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59"></a>. With the [[cold_war_impact_on_space_race | Cold War]] already underway between America and Russia, fears arose that the superpowers might extend their [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | geopolitics]] to Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14"></a>.

## The Antarctic Treaty System

Thankfully, this escalation did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32"></a>. In 1958, US President Eisenhower proposed a treaty to ensure Antarctica remained a free and peaceful place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34"></a>. A conference in Washington led to the signing of the Antarctic Treaty on December 1, 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48"></a>. The treaty had three main points:
*   Antarctica would be used for peaceful purposes only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59"></a>.
*   Freedom for [[scientific_research_and_discoveries_in_antarctica | scientific investigation]] would be guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02"></a>.
*   Results of scientific observations would be freely exchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05"></a>.

Initially signed by 12 governments, including all claimant countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12"></a>, the treaty did not abolish these territorial claims but merely suspended them temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21"></a>. Thus, these countries legally continue to assert their claims today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31"></a>. Australia, for instance, claims the largest share, 42% of Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42"></a>. However, the USA and most other countries do not recognize these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47"></a>. Among the seven claimant countries, France, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway recognize each other's claims, but the UK, Chile, and Argentina do not due to overlapping territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05"></a>.

## Current Geopolitics and Challenges

Today, the land claims in Antarctica are largely symbolic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16"></a>. The treaty's temporary suspension of claims implies their importance upon the treaty's expiry in 2048 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23"></a>. The continued adherence to the treaty has fostered [[scientific_research_and_discoveries_in_antarctica | scientific research]] and collaboration, with about 4,500 scientists visiting Antarctica annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49"></a>.

### [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India's Involvement with Antarctica]]

Initially, India was against the Antarctic Treaty, fearing it would allow the signatory nations to exploit the continent for mining or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18"></a>. India appealed to the United Nations to take control of Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40"></a>. Despite this, India launched its first secret expedition to Antarctica in December 1981, led by Dr. Syed Zahoor Qasim, using a borrowed Norwegian icebreaker, the *Polar Circle* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48"></a>. This expedition, though successful, was technically illegal as India was not a treaty member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24"></a>.

In 1983, under pressure from Non-Aligned Movement countries, the UN General Assembly agreed to discuss Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42"></a>. About a month before this meeting, India abruptly changed its stance, signed the Antarctic Treaty, and applied for Consultative Party status, surprising other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54"></a>. Today, India maintains two active research stations in Antarctica, conducting studies on geology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10"></a>. One notable finding by scientist Sudipta Sengupta during India's second expedition revealed that the Schirmacher Hills on Antarctica's coast were part of a fault line once joined to the Indian subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17"></a>.

### [[environmental_protection_and_mining_ban_in_antarctica | Environmental Protection and Mining Ban in Antarctica]]

In 1991, the Madrid Protocol, an [[environmental_protection_and_mining_ban_in_antarctica | Environmental Protection Treaty]], was signed in Madrid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43"></a>. This protocol finally imposed restrictions on drilling and mining activities, protecting Antarctica from exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52"></a>. This was crucial due to the continent's vast potential resources; a 1992 US Geological Survey estimated 19 billion recoverable barrels of oil, and Russian mineral explorers claim 500 billion barrels of oil and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14"></a>.

Despite these reserves, oil mining has not occurred due to the Madrid Protocol and the high cost of extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32"></a>. However, climate change poses a future [[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | threat of deep sea mining]]; melting ice makes Antarctica more accessible, and future technological advancements could make extraction economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46"></a>.

The Antarctic Treaty is set to expire in 2048 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04"></a>. If it is not renewed, the suspended territorial claims could become highly significant. Countries like China have expanded fishing and tourism in the region, with China being the only country to set up new research stations after 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14"></a>. Illegal exploitation by private yachts has also been reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34"></a>. Calls exist for a new treaty to regulate the ocean around Antarctica to prevent overfishing and establish protected areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43"></a>.

The Antarctic Treaty has a permanent physical presence in Buenos Aires, Argentina, since 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58"></a>. Antarctica remains a unique political territory where countries collaborate and share power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08"></a>, lacking a police force, army, or legal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18"></a>. Loopholes in the treaty are evident, such as tourists getting passports stamped at British, Chilean, and Argentinian stations, which are subtle ways these countries assert their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23"></a>.

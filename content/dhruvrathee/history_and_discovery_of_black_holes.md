Black holes remained largely unknown until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Their conceptualization and eventual discovery are rooted in [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein's Theory of Relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## Theoretical Foundations

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein's Theory of Relativity]] consists of two main parts:
*   **Special Theory of Relativity** Published in 1905, this theory explains how speed influences time, introducing the concept of Kinematic Time Dilation, where time slows down for objects moving at very high speeds relative to stationary observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **General Theory of Relativity** Developed in 1915, this theory expanded on the Special Theory, showing that gravity can also cause time dilation, known as Gravitational Time Dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein]] proposed imagining space-time as a fabric or mesh, where planetary objects placed on it cause it to bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This bending not only attracts physical objects but also leads to time dilation and affects other forms of energy such as sound, heat, and light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. A key conclusion was that gravity affects almost everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. This implied the theoretical possibility of objects in the universe with such immense gravitational force that they could completely absorb light, appearing completely black and unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. These theoretical objects are what are now known as [[types_of_black_holes_and_their_characteristics | Black Holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

At the time [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein]] presented his General Theory of Relativity, the concept of black holes was purely theoretical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. While he understood their theoretical possibility, he did not believe they existed practically and even found the concept "weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. The term "Black Hole" itself was not coined until after [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein's]] passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Understanding and Terminology

After [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein]], many scientists continued to work on the equations of General Relativity, leading to the theoretical proof that objects like black holes do indeed exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. By the 1960s, researchers largely agreed that black holes were not just theoretical constructs but actual entities existing in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

The term "Black Hole" was first used by a magazine in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. However, it gained widespread popularity only after 1967, when physicist John Wheeler popularized it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Despite its sensational nature, the term "Black Hole" can be misleading, as there isn't an actual "hole" in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

## Stellar Collapse and Formation

[[types_of_black_holes_and_their_characteristics | Black holes]] are formed from stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Stars maintain equilibrium through a balance of outward force from nuclear fusion reactions (producing heat and light) and inward gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. When a star's fuel (Hydrogen or Helium) runs out, the outward force ceases, and the star collapses under its own gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

The outcome of this collapse depends on the star's mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>:
*   Small or average-sized stars (like our Sun) become Red Giants, then potentially a planetary nebula or a White Dwarf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   Huge stars with significant mass cool down to become Red Super Giants, which then burst into Supernovae. The remaining tiny core can become a Neutron Star, but if it's larger, it forms a [[types_of_black_holes_and_their_characteristics | Black Hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

The mass of the collapsed star becomes extremely condensed. For instance, if a star as massive as our Sun were to become a black hole, its diameter would be merely 50 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

The criteria for a star to become a black hole were further refined by Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He developed the **Chandrasekhar Limit**, stating that a White Dwarf's maximum stable mass is 1.4 times the mass of our Sun. Beyond this limit, it cannot remain stable and will transform into either a Neutron Star or a [[types_of_black_holes_and_their_characteristics | Black Hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Our Sun is below this limit and will not become a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## First Practical Proof

The practical existence of [[types_of_black_holes_and_their_characteristics | black holes]] was definitively proven with the first photo taken by the Event Horizon Telescope on April 10, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. This landmark image provided empirical evidence for black holes, about 100 years after they were theoretically proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.

While [[scientific_possibility_of_time_travel_to_the_future | traveling to the future]] is considered scientifically possible, albeit with current technological limitations, [[Time Travel Concepts and Types | time travel]] into the past presents significant logical problems known as paradoxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. These obstacles may prevent such travel from ever being possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

## Grandfather Paradox

One of the most well-known paradoxes is the Grandfather Paradox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This concept illustrates a fundamental logical conflict that arises if one could alter the past:
*   A time traveler goes to the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   They kill their great-grandfather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   If their great-grandfather dies, the time traveler would logically never be born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.
*   However, if the time traveler was never born, they could not have traveled to the past to kill their great-grandfather in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
This scenario creates a logical contradiction, as it implies both the existence and non-existence of the time traveler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

## Theories Addressing Paradoxes

Several theories attempt to resolve or explain these paradoxes:

### Theory of Multiverse
The Theory of Multiverse suggests that if a time traveler alters something in the past, it doesn't change their original timeline but instead creates a new, separate universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. This implies the existence of multiple universes, each with different outcomes based on various changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

### Predestination Paradox
The Predestination Paradox posits that any actions a time traveler takes in the past are not actually changes, but rather are the predetermined events that shaped their own present timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. In this view, destiny dictates that things will always turn out a certain way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Example**: A person travels to the past to prevent a friend's accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. However, their intervention in the past is precisely what causes the accident to occur in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
This concept has been explored in various films, including *12 Monkeys*, *Timecrimes* (2007), *The Time Traveller's Wife* (2009), and *Predestination* (2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

Overall, the logical complexities and inherent paradoxes present major challenges that may make [[Time Travel Concepts and Types | time travel]] into the past impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

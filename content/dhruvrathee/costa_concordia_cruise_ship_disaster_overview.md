The Costa Concordia, an Italian cruise ship, embarked on a 7-day European tour on January 13, 2012, at 7:15 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This vessel was larger than the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] and could accommodate an additional 2,000 passengers, carrying 4,252 people on board at the time of the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Ship: Costa Concordia

The Costa Concordia was equipped with numerous amenities, including four large swimming pools, five restaurants, thirteen bars, a casino, a basketball court, a fitness center with a gym, sauna, Turkish bath, and an F1 racing simulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It was the biggest Italian cruise ship of its time, costing $570 million to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The ship was operated by Costa Crociere, an Italian company that began with cargo ships before launching its Costa lines in 1948, becoming a major European cruise ship company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. In 2000, Carnival Corporation acquired Costa Crociere, making it a subsidiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The first ship of the Concordia class, the Costa Concordia, was launched in June 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## The Collision and Immediate Aftermath

On January 13, 2012, approximately 2.5 hours after setting sail, at 9:45 PM, a sudden piercing noise was heard on the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. All lights went off, and the ship began tilting to one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Passengers were initially told via intercom that there was an electrical failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, but in reality, the ship's engine had failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The ship began tilting to the other side shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Many passengers worried about a repeat of the [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | Titanic disaster]], which had occurred exactly 100 years prior in 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Coincidentally, the famous [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] theme song, "My Heart Will Go On," was playing in the dining hall when the electrical failure occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The ship continued to tilt, with lower rooms filling with water, signaling an impending sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## The Role of Captain Francesco Schettino

The captain of the Costa Concordia was [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Francesco Schettino]], who had been with Costa Crociere since 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Intentional Deviation and Collision

At 7:18 PM, the ship departed for Savona, its first destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Within two hours, the ship deviated from its normal route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Captain [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Schettino]] intentionally steered the ship close to Giglio Island, Italy, for a "sail past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Normally, large ships maintain a distance of 7-8 km from shore due to water depth requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. However, the Costa Concordia was only 150 meters from the shore, in dangerously shallow water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport later confirmed the ship was sailing unsafely close to shore at night and at high speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

[[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Captain Schettino]]'s motivation for this maneuver was to pay tribute to his senior captain, Mario Palombo, who lived on Giglio Island, by sounding a siren as they passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Palombo, however, was not on the island that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. A call between them was disconnected at 9:40 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Minutes later, the collision occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

The ship struck rocks, tearing a 70-meter-long wound in its hull, less than 100 meters from the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Water rapidly flooded the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The third officer, Andrea Corollo, found hallways flooded and the engine room, with generators and engines, completely submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Attempts to start the emergency diesel generator at 9:52 PM failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Captain's Deception and Delayed Response

Despite the critical situation, [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Captain Schettino]] initially announced to passengers there was nothing to worry about, stating it was a simple blackout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Around 10:00 PM, Schettino decided to turn the ship around, reasoning it would be safer to sink near the island than in the open sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This U-turn caused the ship to tilt from left to right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

At 10:05 PM and 10:07 PM, the ship's crisis coordinator, Roberto Ferrarini, called [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Captain Schettino]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. It was only in the second call that Schettino acknowledged problems with the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

> "Turning away from the truth can be very dangerous, as you will see later in the story. And this applies to our lives too." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>

[[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Captain Schettino]] then tried to cover up his mistakes, claiming the blackout caused the accident, reversing the actual timeline where the accident caused the blackout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. At 10:12 PM, the Italian coast guard called Schettino after distressed passengers contacted them, but he continued to downplay the incident, saying it was just a blackout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

Thirty minutes after the collision, at 10:22 PM, [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Captain Schettino]] finally changed his stance, telling the radio operator to inform the coast guard of a collision on the left side of the ship, requesting tugboat assistance, and stating passengers were safe with life jackets distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A general emergency alarm was raised at 10:33 PM, instructing passengers to gather in assembly areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

By 10:48 PM, over an hour after the accident, the ship was tilted 30° <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Captain Schettino]] finally gave the order to [[rescue_and_evacuation_efforts_of_Costa_Concordia_passengers | abandon ship]] at 10:59 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Evacuation and Heroism

With 4,200 people on board and the ship tilted at 30°, chaos ensued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Some passengers had already fled in lifeboats or swam to the nearby island before the official announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Passengers pushed and shoved to reach lifeboats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Some crew members, fed up with [[role_and_actions_of_captain_Francesco_Schettino | Captain Schettino]]'s behavior, had already started rebelling and helping passengers into lifeboats 10-15 minutes before his order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. As the ship tilted further to 40° and then 50°, cabins on the right side reached sea level, allowing some passengers to jump into the water and swim to the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Passengers on the other side faced difficulties finding a way out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Language barriers were a problem, as most passengers were Italian, but many crew members did not speak Italian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Additionally, most crew members were service staff, untrained for emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Despite these issues, many crew members acted heroically. Karnaatha Rameshana, an Indian security staff member, personally helped a blind woman onto a lifeboat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Two other members carried wheelchair-bound passengers to lifeboats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

Another Indian crew member, [[rescue_efforts_and_the_sinking_aftermath | Russell Rebello]], a waiter, helped passengers onto lifeboats until the very last moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. He tragically drowned while helping passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

> "Indian waiter Russel Rebello is said to have d!ed after giving up his own life-jacket to save one passenger and helping others into lifeboats." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>

In stark contrast, [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Captain Schettino]] was among the first crew members to [[rescue_and_evacuation_efforts_of_Costa_Concordia_passengers | abandon the ship]] at 11:19 PM, just minutes after giving the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

> "Italian cruise ship captain, apparently ran for lifeboat, and got off the wreck, while his crew and passengers were still on board fighting for their lives." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>

### Giglio Island's Response

The local residents of Giglio Island, with a population of only 700 people, came out to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The deputy mayor, Mario Pellegrini, a civilian, went to the ship to help, rescuing people trapped in wells of water inside the tilting vessel using a rope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Around 2,500 to 3,300 people safely reached the island in the early stages of the [[rescue_and_evacuation_efforts_of_Costa_Concordia_passengers | evacuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

The residents opened their homes, schools, churches, and canteens to provide shelter, blankets, and dry clothes to the survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Many survivors suffered from hypothermia, and all were desperate to find family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

### Official Rescue Efforts and Fatalities

At 11:38 PM, about 400 people were still trapped on the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The Italian Coast Guard helicopters and fire and [[rescue_and_evacuation_efforts_of_Costa_Concordia_passengers | rescue services]] boats arrived, saving hundreds more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. At 12:42 AM, Coast Guard Commander Captain Gregorio De Falco famously called [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Captain Schettino]], ordering him to return to the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Schettino, however, made excuses and did not go back, earning him the moniker "Captain Coward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

The [[rescue_and_evacuation_efforts_of_Costa_Concordia_passengers | rescue operation]] continued for 2-2.5 weeks, involving the Italian Navy, Coast Guard, and Fire and Rescue Service, including rescue divers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. On January 14, a South Korean couple was rescued after being trapped in their cabin due to water pressure preventing the door from opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. Most of the fatalities occurred from people drowning after being trapped in their cabins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. A total of 32 people died in the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

## Salvage and Legal Consequences

The Costa Concordia was declared a constructive total loss by engineers, meaning it could not be saved or reused; its only option was to be disassembled and sold for scrap metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

### Fuel Removal

The first step was to remove the ship's 1.9 million liters of fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. An oil barrier was built around the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. The oil removal process began on February 12, 2012, and lasted over a month until March 24, requiring the semi-solid fuel to be reheated before being pumped to another tanker ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### [[engineering_challenges_and_costs_of_salvaging_the_Costa_Concordia | Salvage Operation]]

Setting the ship upright and relocating it was a massive [[engineering_challenges_and_costs_of_salvaging_the_Costa_Concordia | engineering project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Work began in April 2013 with the construction of a steel structure in the water to raise the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Huge watertight boxes called caissons were attached to the upper side of the ship, filled with water to make them heavier, and then used with ropes and cables to pull the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. A total of 15 caissons were installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

On September 16, 2013, the process of straightening the Concordia began, taking 19 hours with the use of pulling machines, steel structures, and caissons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. To make the ship float, more caissons were installed on the other side, and water was drained from them, causing them to float and lift the entire ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

This [[engineering_challenges_and_costs_of_salvaging_the_Costa_Concordia | salvage operation]] involved 500 divers, technicians, engineers, and biologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Nineteen months after the accident, the cost of rescuing the ship alone reached $799 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. The ship was towed to port in July 2014, by which time the total cost of the operation had reached $1.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Scraping the metal from the broken ship, involving over 350 people, ended in July 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

### [[legal_consequences_and_compensation_related_to_the_Concordia_disaster | Legal Consequences]]

Costa Crociere compensated each surviving passenger by refunding their ticket price and paying an additional €11,000 (around ₹1 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. The families of the deceased passengers received an undisclosed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. The total cost of this disaster for the company was $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

[[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Captain Schettino]]'s habit of lying continued during the court trial; he claimed his foot slipped and he accidentally fell into a lifeboat while the ship was at a 60°-70° angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. In 2017, he was charged with manslaughter and sentenced to 16 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. His former senior captain, Mario Palombo, revealed that Schettino had always been a liar who preferred to lie rather than admit mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

Roberto Bosio, another ship captain from Costa Serena, was onboard the Concordia that night but, unlike Schettino, did not flee the ship and helped passengers until the end, even before Schettino's official announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. He stated, "Only a disgraceful man would have left all those passengers on board... I just did my duty. A captain's duty." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. Along with Schettino, five high-ranking officers were also arrested and sentenced to two years each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. As of 2024, [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Schettino]] is serving his sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

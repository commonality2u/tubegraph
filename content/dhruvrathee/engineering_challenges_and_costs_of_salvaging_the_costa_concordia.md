Following the [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]] disaster on January 13, 2012, significant engineering challenges and immense costs were incurred to salvage the massive cruise ship from its resting place off Giglio Island, Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Initial Assessment and Declaration
Engineers declared the [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]] a "constructive total loss," meaning it was beyond repair and could not be used again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. The only viable option was to disassemble it and sell its scrap metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

## Fuel Removal
One of the immediate and critical challenges was the removal of fuel from the sunken ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. The [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]] was fully loaded and had just begun its voyage, meaning its fuel tank was full, containing approximately 1.9 million litres of fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

*   **Process:**
    *   An oil barrier was constructed around the ship to contain any potential spills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.
    *   The oil removal process began on February 12, 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.
    *   A significant challenge was that much of the fuel was in a semi-solid state due to the cold winter temperatures, requiring it to be reheated before extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
    *   After heating, the oil was transferred via pumps to another tanker ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.
*   **Duration:** This complex process lasted over a month, concluding on March 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

## Parbuckling and Refloating
The next major engineering feat was to set the ship upright and relocate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.

*   **Steel Structure:** A robust steel structure was built in the water to support the ship during the raising process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. Work on this began in April 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>.
*   **Caissons:** Huge watertight boxes, known as caissons, were attached to the upper side of the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. Water was filled into these caissons to make them heavier, and ropes and cables were used to pull them as weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>. A total of 15 such caissons were installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>.
*   **Straightening:** On September 16, 2013, the actual process of straightening the [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Concordia]] began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>. This operation took 19 hours, utilizing pulling machines, steel structures, and caissons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Refloating:** To make the ship float, more caissons were installed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. Water was then drained from all the caissons, causing them to become buoyant and lift the entire ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.
*   **Personnel:** This monumental process involved 500 divers, technicians, engineers, and biologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>.

## Towing and Scrapping
Once refloated, the ship needed to be towed to a port for disassembly.

*   **Towing:** In July 2014, another ship was used to tow the [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]] to its final destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:45">[02:45:45]</a>.
*   **Scrapping:** The process of scrapping metal from the broken ship required significant effort and money, with over 350 people working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. This final stage concluded in July 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>.

## Financial Costs
The salvage operation and overall disaster incurred massive financial costs:

*   **Construction Cost:** The [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]] originally cost $570 million (₹25 billion at the time) to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>.
*   **Rescue and Recovery:** 19 months after the accident, the cost of rescuing the ship alone had reached $799 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:39">[02:39:39]</a>.
*   **Total Operation Cost:** By the time the ship was towed in July 2014, the total cost of the operation had escalated to $1.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>.
*   **Compensation and Total Disaster Cost:** The company, Costa Crociere, compensated each surviving passenger by returning their ticket price and paying an additional €11,000 (approximately ₹1 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>. The families of the deceased also received an undisclosed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:33">[02:33:33]</a>. The total cost of the disaster for the company reached $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:38">[02:38:38]</a>.

On June 18, 2023, at 9:30 AM, five individuals embarked on an extreme adventure tourism journey aboard the submersible named Titan, diving into the sea to witness the wreck of the [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This expedition was costly, with each person spending over ₹20 million for a few hours of the tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] wreck lies at a depth of 3,810 meters (approximately 12,500 feet) below the surface of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Mission Timeline and Disappearance

The Titan submersible began its descent, which typically takes about two hours to reach the target depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The submersible was designed to send signals to its support ship on the surface, the Polar Prince, at 15-minute intervals, serving as its sole communication channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

However, after only 1 hour and 45 minutes into its dive on June 18, the Titan suddenly lost contact with the Polar Prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. By 4:30 PM, the scheduled time for the submersible's return, there was no sign of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. At 7:10 PM, the Polar Prince team informed the US Coast Guard, initiating a four-day multinational search and rescue operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This extensive operation involved aircraft, ships, and robot vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

On June 22, an ROV (remotely operated vehicle) discovered debris on the ocean floor, approximately 490 meters from the [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic's]] bow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The debris confirmed that the submersible had broken apart and the five people aboard had perished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## The Titan Submersible

The Titan submersible, while often colloquially referred to as a "submarine," is distinctly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Unlike submarines, which can operate independently, submersibles require a support ship to launch and recover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For the Titan mission, the support ship was the Polar Prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### OceanGate Expeditions

The entire operation was managed by OceanGate, a company founded in 2009 by aerospace engineer Stockton Rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. OceanGate's objective was to offer deep-sea expeditions to wealthy individuals as a form of tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. They began offering [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] tours in July 2021, and had previously offered tours to other shipwrecks and areas like Azores and Bahamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. OceanGate also operated two other submersibles, Antipodes and Cyclops, with depth capacities of 304m and 500m respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The Titan, however, was designed to reach depths of 4,000 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Depth and Environment

The [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] wreck lies at 3,810 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, where the pressure is nearly 400 times that on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. At depths beyond 3,800 feet (approximately 1,158 meters), the "midnight zone" begins, where no sunlight penetrates and water temperatures are around 4°C (39°F) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For comparison, the deepest underwater rescue operation ever conducted was at 480 meters (1,600 feet) in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### [[design_and_materials_of_the_titan_submersible | Design and Materials]]

The [[design_and_materials_of_the_titan_submersible | Titan submersible]] was designed to accommodate five people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Hull**: Its main body, or Hull, was made of [[design_and_materials_of_the_titan_submersible | carbon fibre]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Caps**: Two titanium caps were attached at the ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: It measured approximately 6.7 meters in length and weighed over 10,400 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Propulsion**: It featured four electric thrusters (two horizontal, two vertical) for operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Viewport**: The Titan's viewport was notably the largest installed in any private submersible to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Control**: The submersible was remarkably controlled by a video game controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Interior**: Inside, there were no seats, and a small, unpartitioned toilet was located beside the viewport, requiring others to face away when in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### [[communication_and_control_systems_of_titan_submersible | Communication and Control Systems]]

Due to the extreme depth, GPS did not function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. [[communication_and_control_systems_of_titan_submersible | Communication with the support ship]] relied on a text messaging system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. OceanGate had previously stated they used Starlink's satellite internet service for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## The Passengers

On the fateful June 18 mission, five individuals were on board:
*   **Hamish Harding**: A 58-year-old British billionaire, adventurer, and three-time Guinness World Record holder, known for his expedition to the South Pole, a dive into the Mariana Trench, and participation in a Blue Origin suborbital flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Paul Henri Nargeolet**: A 77-year-old former commander of the French Navy and director of underwater research for the [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | RMS Titanic]], who had visited the wreck 37 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Shahzada Dawood**: A British-Pakistani businessman and owner of one of Pakistan's largest companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Suleman Dawood**: Shahzada's 19-year-old son, who reportedly joined the trip despite being scared, to accompany his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Stockton Rush**: The CEO of OceanGate and pilot of the Titan submersible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Search and Rescue Efforts

After communication ceased at 11:15 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, hopes remained that the Titan might resurface, as it had an internal mechanism for passengers to release ballasts and ascend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. However, even if it had resurfaced, those inside would have faced oxygen depletion, as the submersible's door could only be opened from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Adding to the urgency was the Titan's 96-hour oxygen supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> and the absence of an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The search area spanned 25,000 square kilometers, making the task of locating the van-sized submersible incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Initial efforts involved American and Canadian aircraft deploying sonar to detect underwater signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Multiple ships joined the search, along with remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. On the third day of the search, a Canadian aircraft's sonar detected banging noises at half-hour intervals, though the US Coast Guard later confirmed these sounds were unrelated to the Titan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## The Implosion

The debris found on June 22 confirmed that the Titan had undergone a catastrophic implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Unlike an explosion, where force moves outwards, an implosion involves force moving inwards, causing the structure to break apart due to being squeezed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. A "catastrophic implosion" implies the destruction happened instantaneously, without the occupants feeling anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Reasons for Implosion and Safety Concerns

The primary reason identified for the implosion was the [[design_and_materials_of_the_titan_submersible | carbon fibre]] hull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. While most submarines and submersibles are made of steel, titanium, or aluminum, the Titan's [[design_and_materials_of_the_titan_submersible | carbon fibre]] design was experimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Ocean explorer Robert Ballard, who discovered the [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] wreck in 1985, stated that [[design_and_materials_of_the_titan_submersible | carbon fibre]] was not a suitable material for such deep-sea applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Director James Cameron, who has extensive deep-sea experience, echoed these concerns, noting that the titanium caps remained intact, but the [[design_and_materials_of_the_titan_submersible | carbon fibre]] body was in pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

Stockton Rush, OceanGate's CEO, had a controversial stance on safety. He had expressed views that the US Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 "needlessly prioritizing passenger safety over commercial innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a> and that "safety just is pure waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Rush admitted to intentionally "breaking some rules" with the Titan's design, using [[design_and_materials_of_the_titan_submersible | carbon fibre]] and titanium despite regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

Internal and external warnings about the Titan's safety were well-documented:
*   In January 2018, OceanGate's Director of Marine Operations, David Lochridge, raised safety concerns about the Titan and filed a lawsuit when the company refused to address them or certify the submersible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   On March 27, 2018, 36 industry leaders, including deep-sea explorers and oceanographers, sent a letter to Stockton Rush, warning that OceanGate's experimental approach and lack of quality checks could lead to a "terrible accident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   Another deep-sea specialist emailed Rush in March 2018, advising caution and stating that Rush was endangering himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

Rush was accused of repeating the fatal hubris of the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]], whose creators believed it was "unsinkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. The Titan tragedy underscored the critical importance of adhering to safety standards and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Stockton Rush's name has now been added to the list of inventors killed by their own inventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

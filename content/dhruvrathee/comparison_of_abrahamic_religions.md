From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

The video begins by presenting a narrative puzzle, describing a man named "AM" (Ram/Abraham), his wife "S" (Sita/Sarah), a relative "L" (Lakshman/Lot), and a king with a name ending in "N" (Ravan/Pharaoh) who takes the woman captive. Initially, this sounds like the Hindu epic Ramayana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, the same description also fits the story of Prophet Abraham, Sarah, Lot, and Pharaoh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This comparison serves to highlight unexpected similarities between different [[religious_scriptural_stories_and_myths | religious scriptural stories and myths]].

The creator emphasizes the importance of making videos on religions in today's world to counter the exploitation of religion by politicians and media to spread fear and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The aim is to foster understanding and brotherhood by learning about different faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Monotheism and the Abrahamic Faiths

Many believe that Prophet Abraham was the first figure to preach [[monotheism_vs_polytheism | monotheism]], the belief in only one God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This stands in contrast to [[monotheism_vs_polytheism | polytheism]], which involves believing in many gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are collectively known as Abrahamic religions, deriving their name from Prophet Abraham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

While many Jews and Christians consider Abraham to be the first prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, some Christians believe Enoch was the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, as Genesis states "Enoch walked with God for 300 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Muslims, however, believe Adam was the first prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Shared Stories and Themes

### Adam and Eve

The story of Adam (also called Aadm) and Eve is central to these three religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
God is believed to have created Adam from soil and breathed life into him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden, where he was allowed to eat from any tree except the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Feeling Adam might be lonely, God later created Eve from one of Adam's bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

A snake (serpent) misled Eve into eating the forbidden fruit, promising enlightenment and likeness to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Eve then shared the fruit with Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This act angered God, who cursed:
*   The snake to crawl on its stomach and eat dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   The woman (Eve) to endure intense pain during childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   The man (Adam) to work hard for his living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
All three were then expelled from the Garden of Eden to live on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This story has been referenced in pop culture, such as the film "Knowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### The Great Flood (Noah's Ark / King Manu / Epic of Gilgamesh)

After thousands of years, humanity became increasingly evil, causing God to regret creating them and decide to wipe out all life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. However, God found one righteous person, Noah (called Nuh by Muslims), and revealed His plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Noah was instructed to build a large ark and bring his family, along with a male and female of every living creature, and sufficient food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

A great flood ensued, raining for 40 days and 40 nights, submerging the Earth for 150 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Noah's Ark remained afloat, eventually resting on Mount Ararat, where life could begin anew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Noah then made an offering to God, who promised never to destroy life in such a way again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This story has influenced films like "2012" and "Noah" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

This story of a great flood and survival in a boat is not unique to Abrahamic religions, highlighting [[comparisons_with_other_ancient_civilizations | broader themes across ancient civilizations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>:
*   **Hinduism**: The story of King Manu, who saves a small fish (Matsya, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu). The fish warns Manu of a coming flood and tells him to build a boat to save living creatures, plants, and the Saptarishis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Mesopotamia**: The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh features Utnapishtim, a sage warned of a great flood who builds a boat to save his relatives, creatures, and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Greek Mythology**: Due to Zeus's anger, a great flood occurs. Deucalion, warned by his father Prometheus, builds a boat with his wife to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Abram and the Idols

A famous story, not in the Hebrew Bible but in Midrash Genesis Rabbah and the Qur'an, tells of Abram breaking idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Abram's father, Terah, was an idol maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. While left in charge of his father's shop, Abram questioned why people worshipped idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. He then broke all the idols except the largest, placing a stick in its hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. When confronted, he suggested they ask the largest idol what happened, exposing the idols' inability to speak or act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

As a result, Abram was ordered to enter a great fire, with the understanding that the real God would save him if he was right. God indeed saved him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This story is cited as a reason why idols are not worshipped in Judaism and Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Interpretations of Idol Worship and "Kafir"

The video delves into the nuanced views on idol worship:

*   **Hinduism**: Hindus generally do not worship idols themselves, but rather worship God *through* the idol, similar to remembering a father by looking at his photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Acharya Prashanth states, "The idol has been a good means to reach the formless," and it is understood that "the idol is not the true God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Christianity**: Christians also use idols, such as statues of Jesus and Mary in churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. While Exodus forbids bowing down to idols of *other things*, God himself commanded Prophet Moses to make Cherub statues, from which He would speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Islam**: The Quran forbids associating partners with God ("Don't worship anyone other than God") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. The term "Kafir" (Kufr means disbelief, Kafir means one who disbelieves in God) is often misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. A liberal Muslim perspective suggests that any person submitting to God, regardless of the name they use, could be considered a "Muslim" (one who submits before God) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Historically, the Quran considered Jews, Christians, and Sabians among believers, and only mentions fighting those who believe an idol to be God (like the Quraysh tribe's worship of Hubal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Beyond physical idols, the Quran also warns against "idolizing" property, wealth, or one's ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This sentiment is echoed in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity, which caution against worshipping material desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Furthermore, [[monotheism_vs_polytheism | monotheistic sentiments]] are found in ancient Hindu texts like Rigveda and Yajurveda, which describe God as one, pervasive, and formless, known by many names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. This highlights the fundamental similarities across religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

### Addressing Violence in Scriptures

While people of other monotheistic religions are not necessarily "Kafirs" in Abrahamic faiths, atheists who disbelieve in God are often termed "Kafirs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. The video addresses the common misinterpretation of religious texts that appear to call for violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Passages such as:
*   Quran Chapter 9 Verse 5 ("Kill the Mushrik, meaning disbelievers, wherever you find them") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
*   Hebrew Bible, Book 1: Samuel, Chapter 15 (God's command to destroy Amalekites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   Gospel of Matthew Chapter 10 Verses 34-36 (Jesus saying, "I did not come to bring peace but a sword") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2 Shloka 31 to 38 (Lord Krishna telling Arjun that fighting for a Kshatriya opens doors to heavenly planets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

These lines, when read out of context, can seem to promote violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. However, the video argues that all these scriptures are heavily [[interpreting_religious_scriptures | contextual]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. For example, Krishna's words to Arjun are in the context of the Mahabharata war, and Prophet Muhammad's commands are in the context of fighting the Quraysh tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Jesus's words are metaphorical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

The speaker asserts that no scripture actually tells one to kill innocent people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Instead, [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | terrorists and orthodox individuals deliberately misinterpret these texts]] to incite violence and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. The video highlights peaceful scholars like Wahiduddin Khan, who emphasizes Islam as a religion of peace, contrasting them with figures like Osama Bin Laden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. It warns against a "centralized conspiracy unit" that spreads misinformation about religious texts to instigate [[religious_and_castebased_tensions_in_india | religious and caste-based tensions in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

## The Story of Abraham and Sarah (and its initial comparison)

The story introduced at the beginning, similar to the Ramayana, involves Abram, his wife Sarai, and his nephew Lot leaving their home at God's command to find a new land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. To escape a famine, they travel to Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. Fearing the Egyptians would kill him for Sarai's beauty, Abram tells her to claim she is his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

Pharaoh's officials take Sarai to the palace, and Abram is treated well, receiving many animals and servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. However, Pharaoh's household is afflicted with diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Pharaoh discovers the deception, angrily confronts Abram, and sends them out of Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

Later, Abram and Lot separate due to conflicts between their shepherds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Abram lives in Canaan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

### The Divergence of Abrahamic Religions

Abram and Sarai were childless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Sarai gave her slave woman Hagar to Abram, and Hagar bore a son named Ishmael <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. God then made an agreement with Abram, promising he would be the father of many nations, and renamed him Abraham. Sarai was renamed Sarah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. God also promised Abraham all the land of Canaan, which spans from the valley of Egypt to the Euphrates River (present-day Israel, West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, and southern Syria/Lebanon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. This promised land became significant for the Zionist movement in Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

Later, God promised Sarah a son, and Isaac was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Due to Ishmael's behavior, Sarah told Abraham to send him away. God instructed Abraham to comply, and Hagar and Ishmael went into the desert, where God promised Ishmael would become a great nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

This point marks the separation of the Abrahamic religions:
*   **Judaism and Christianity**: Believe they are descendants of Isaac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Jews trace their lineage through Isaac's son Jacob (renamed Israel), who became the ancestor of the 12 tribes of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. Christians consider themselves spiritual descendants of Isaac through Jesus, who is believed to be a descendant of Isaac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   **Islam**: Believes Abraham and Ishmael together built the Kaaba in Mecca, the most sacred site in Islam, and Muslims trace their spiritual lineage to Ishmael <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

This highlights how these three major religions share common foundational stories but diverge in their lineage and prophetic figures, contributing to the [[role_of_religion_in_society | role of religion in society]] and their distinct identities.

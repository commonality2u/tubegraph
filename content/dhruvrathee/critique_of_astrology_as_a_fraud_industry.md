Astrology is presented as a fraud industry that has deceived millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This critique aims to expose the deceptive practices and lack of validity in astrological predictions.

## Failed Predictions

Astrologers frequently make predictions that prove to be false, yet their credibility often remains unchallenged by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Sporting Events
Before the T20 World Cup semi-final match between India and England, 11 astrologers on an ABP news program predicted India's certain victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. They also predicted a "neck-to-neck battle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, India lost to England in a one-sided match, with England chasing India's 168 runs in 16 overs without losing any wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Pandemic and World Events
India's famous astrologer Bejan Daruwalla predicted in 2020 that Covid-19 would be completely eradicated or significantly slowed down after May 15, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Other astrologers made similar claims about the pandemic's peak and end dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Historically, numerous predictions about the world's end have also failed:
*   In 1499, German mathematician and astrologer Johannes St√∂ffler predicted the world would end on February 20, 1524, due to a great flood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Christian numerologist David Meade predicted the world would end on September 23, 2017, due to a hidden planet colliding with Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This also did not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   American preacher Harold Camping claimed the world would end on May 21, 2011, and later postponed it to October 2011 when his initial prediction failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   The Mayan calendar, which spanned 5,125 years, was widely misinterpreted to suggest the world would end on December 21, 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. A Reuters poll found that 1 in 7 people across 20 countries believed this prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

According to historian Francesco Guicciardini, astrologers maintain credibility by having one truth among hundreds of lies, while a common person loses credibility if one lie is found among hundreds of truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## [[scientific_basis_and_logical_arguments_against_astrology | Lack of Scientific Basis]]

Astrological predictions lack scientific basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Dr. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, a Nobel Prize winner for Chemistry, stated that the movement of stars and planets has no effect on human lives, and there is no scientific basis for such claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   The primary force exerted by celestial bodies like the Sun and Moon on Earth is gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Gravitational force depends on mass and distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. It is illogical to suggest that gravitational force could dictate personal outcomes like job prospects or college admissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   Logically, the Sun and other planets do not discriminate based on birth dates to exert different gravitational forces on individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Logical Inconsistencies

### Sun Signs and Birthdays
Consider individuals born within the same astrological sign (e.g., Aquarius: January 20 - February 18) and those born a day apart across different signs (e.g., Babli: Feb 18, Bablu: Feb 19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. It is illogical that two people born nearly a month apart (Bunty and Babli) would have the same horoscope, while two born a day apart (Babli and Bablu) have completely different horoscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Twin Studies
Astrology suggests that individuals born at similar times should have similar lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. A 1958 study in London registered over 2,000 children born at the same time and monitored their development over decades, noting over 100 characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The results, published in 2003 in the *Journal of Consciousness Studies*, found no similarities among these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
Furthermore, in tragedies like bridge collapses, earthquakes, or floods, hundreds of people die together who were not born at the same time or under the same astrological signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Astrologers and Destiny
If destiny is predetermined, it is illogical that a mediocre astrologer could change it through remedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Examples include:
*   Nirmal Baba's claim that eating green chutney with samosas brings good luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   Adding or removing letters from names (e.g., "R" in Ayushman Khurana, "H" from Rani Mukherji, "S" in Tusshar Kapoor) to alter one's fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This ignores the need for actual skills, like acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   Matching birth charts for marriage and selecting auspicious wedding dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. However, countries where these customs are absent still have successful marriages, and adherence to them does not guarantee against divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Financial Practices
If astrologers' predictions were genuinely accurate, they could use their knowledge to gain wealth by investing in the stock market or winning lotteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Instead, they are often observed requesting money from clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Reasons People Believe

Millions of people continue to believe in astrology despite its logical and scientific flaws due to several reasons:

### Weak Minds and the Desire for Certainty
People generally prefer certainty in their lives, and the uncertainty of the future can be distressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Astrological predictions offer a sense of security and happiness through positive affirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Swami Vivekananda stated that such beliefs indicate a weak mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Individuals who want to believe in astrology will often do so blindly, without questioning the astrologer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology | Cold Reading]]
Astrologers use a technique called [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology | cold reading]] to make generalized statements that seem specific to an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   For example, a prediction like "Your fate will take a turn for the better when you turn 30" is vague enough to encompass various positive life events (e.g., new job, marriage, having a baby, narrowly escaping an accident) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   Similarly, "An incident happened in your childhood that has left a lasting impact on your life" can apply to almost anyone, referring to events like the death of a pet, a family member, or experiences of abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology | Barnum Effect]] (Forer Effect)
The [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology | Barnum Effect]], also known as the Forer Effect, describes how individuals rate generalized personality descriptions as highly accurate for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   In 1948, psychologist Bertram R. Forer conducted an experiment where he gave 39 students a personality test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Each student received the *exact same* personality sketch, consisting of 13 general qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Despite the identical nature of the sketches, the average accuracy rating from students was 4.26 out of 5, indicating that most believed it accurately described their unique personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   This happens because people prefer to hear positive or sympathetic things about themselves and like to believe they are special and unique, even though many human experiences are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

An example of applying the Barnum Effect includes statements like:
*   "You have so much capacity you have not tapped into yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   "You need some variety in your life. That's why you do not like anyone restricting you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   "You've seen that revealing everything about yourself to someone is not good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   "Often you doubt whether you made the right decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   "You are very kind-hearted. Always adjusting for other people's sake... But as a consequence, people take advantage of you. They think of you as an emotional fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
These statements are crafted to resonate with a wide audience, making individuals feel uniquely understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

### [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | Picking Up Clues]]
Astrologers are often highly observant, similar to mentalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. They gather information by observing a person's:
*   Dressing style (formal, casual, designer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>
*   Physical appearance (weight, fitness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>
*   Language (plain Hindi, regional mix, English words) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>
*   Demeanor (confident, vulnerable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>

These observations allow them to accurately guess details about a person's hobbies, job, economic status, and education level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
Felicity Carter, a former astrologer, revealed that she repeatedly heard similar stories from clients seeking help with romance, work, or life changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Her experience enabled her to deduce a person's problems merely from their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. For example, she could accurately address a heartbroken young person by saying, "Let her go. She's not worth it," leaving them shocked by her apparent insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

### [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | Simple Fraud]]
Many astrologers, particularly in India, use fraudulent methods to obtain personal information about clients through secret channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
Shyam Manav, founder of the Akhil Bharatiya Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (an organization that debunks superstitions), demonstrated this practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. He recounts an incident where he gave false information to a rickshaw driver en route to an astrologer's office in Indore, claiming to be an English professor from Nagpur University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Upon entering the astrologer's office, he was astonished to hear the astrologer loudly call for the "English Professor from Nagpur University," confirming that the information had been relayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

## Conclusion
These techniques and psychological phenomena are used by astrologers to deceive millions of people worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. The video encourages viewers to share this information with friends and family who believe in astrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. It also criticizes YouTubers, influencers, actors, and celebrities who promote these falsehoods, urging them to stop misleading others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Ultimately, the message emphasizes that an individual's future is largely in their own hands, and they are responsible for writing their own destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

The deep ocean, a vast and largely unexplored realm, is home to a phenomenon known as the Diel Vertical Migration (DVM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This refers to the daily movement of countless marine organisms between the deep sea and the ocean surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Discovery of the Deep Scattering Layer

During World War II, sonar operators in the navy made a startling discovery: they observed what appeared to be a "false sea floor" that would rise hundreds of meters at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This was not the actual seabed moving, but rather "millions and billions of fish" swimming from the deep sea towards the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This unique event was later termed the "Deep Scattering Layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, identified as a part of the sea that reflects sound due to the high density of marine life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This provided the first clue to the "hidden highways of the sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## The Largest Migration on Earth

Scientists have since determined that every day, "millions and billions of creatures" — ranging from small zooplankton to medium-sized fish — undertake a massive journey, swimming to the surface and then returning to the depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This phenomenon is considered the largest migration on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, occurring daily and hidden from human eyes for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. The collective weight of these migrating animals is estimated to be 25 times more than the total mass of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This DVM occurs globally, from the Pacific and Indian Oceans to the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

## Purpose of Diel Vertical Migration

The primary reason for this arduous daily journey is "to eat without being eaten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Feeding**: Phytoplankton, the base of the oceanic food chain, thrive near the surface where photosynthesis is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Small fish and zooplankton ascend at night to feed on this abundant food source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   **Predator Avoidance**: During the day, the surface waters are bright, making these smaller creatures vulnerable to predators like sharks, whales, and dolphins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. By migrating to the dark, deep waters during daylight hours, they can avoid being eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

## Impact of Climate Change

In recent years, the nature of this migration has been changing due to [[impact_of_climate_change_on_marine_life | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Instead of a daily migration, some [[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | deep sea creatures]] are migrating permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Ocean Warming**: The oceans absorb over 90% of global warming heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, leading to rising water temperatures. Surface waters warm up while the deep sea remains cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Depletion**: Warmer surface water is less dense than cold deep water, preventing easy mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This inhibits oxygen transfer to the deep sea, leading to oxygen shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Forced Migration**: [[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | Deep sea creatures]], evolved in stable oxygen environments, are now migrating towards the surface in search of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This is dangerous for them as they are not adapted to surface conditions and become easy prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Future Projections**: By the end of the century, the temperature of the Abyssal zone is predicted to increase by 1° Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, potentially causing [[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | deep sea creatures]] to migrate 4 to 11 times faster than those near the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This puts the future of these creatures in danger, with many potentially facing extinction before they are even discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

## Threats from Human Activities

Beyond climate change, human activities like [[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | Deep Sea Mining]] pose an immediate threat to [[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | deep sea creatures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Organizations like the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition are working to prevent this destruction, emphasizing that the deep sea is a frontier of nature that can still be protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

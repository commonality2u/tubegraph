Bollywood cinema, once celebrated for its unique storytelling and diverse genres, is increasingly perceived as having lost its soul and imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, with its age-old drama having dried up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the year 2023 saw a resurgence in box office numbers with films like Shahrukh Khan's *Jawan*, *Pathan*, and *Dunki* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, this apparent success masks a "bitter truth" regarding the industry's dwindling creativity and focus on short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Impact of External Factors

### The Covid-19 Shock and Rise of OTT
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted Bollywood, as lockdowns and restrictions prevented people from attending cinema halls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This period saw an unprecedented growth in OTT (Over-The-Top) platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, offering numerous films at a fraction of the cost, and later, even free content through advertisement-revenue models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. These platforms provided access to regional language content, international films (dubbed in Hindi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, and even Kdramas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, intensifying [[competition_from_ott_platforms_and_international_films | competition from OTT platforms and international films]] for Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Internal Challenges: Corporatisation and Formulaic Filmmaking

### The "Hit Formula"
A significant problem plaguing Bollywood from within is the increasing [[impact_of_corporatisation_on_bollywood_cinema | corporatisation]] of film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Producers, aiming for maximum profit with minimal effort, have adopted a formula for creating "hit" films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>:
*   **Lack of Innovation** Don't try anything new; stick to what's proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Action-Oriented** Make action films with violence and sequels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Remakes** Remake super-hit films or old songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This strategy of remaking Tamil and Telugu films no longer works as people can watch the originals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Superstar Casting** Cast superstars in lead roles and actors with "good face value" in side roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Hollywood Imitation** Copy Hollywood stories, scenes, and scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Appealing to the Masses** Avoid thought-provoking content; instead, appease the audience's mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Fast-Paced Narratives** No long, profound scenes due to decreased attention spans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Larger-than-Life Production** Utilize big stars, sets, locations, budgets, and heavy VFX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Extensive Marketing** Spend heavily on marketing to generate buzz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

This formula results in "blockbuster" films that break records but are not memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Films that touch the heart or provoke thought are disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Many of the highest-grossing films like *Jawan*, *Pathan*, *Dilwale*, and *Happy New Year* are considered "mediocre" or "average" in terms of filmmaking, screenplay, acting, and direction when compared to older classics by the same superstars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Films like *Tiger 3*, *Tiger Zinda Hai*, *Kick*, *Race 3*, *Dabangg 3*, *Radhe*, *Antim*, and *Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan* also fall into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### The Role of Corporate Greed
Filmmakers like Shekhar Kapur, Mani Ratnam, Ram Gopal Verma, Anurag Basu, and Shyam Benegal have expressed concerns that corporations now control creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Studios dictate what gets made, often rejecting directors' original ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Veteran filmmaker Shyam Benegal regards studio-backed films as a "factory line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Screenwriter Chirag Garg notes that writing, once a passionate endeavor, has become a mechanical process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

This trend is also seen in Hollywood, where films are often accused of prioritizing VFX over story or creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. However, Bollywood struggles to compete with Hollywood due to its smaller budgets, fewer VFX, and smaller sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### [[Financial inequality and inflated actor fees in Bollywood | Financial Inequality and Inflated Actor Fees]]
Despite India's box office having its best year in 2023, earning ₹122.26 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, a dangerous level of inequality exists. 40% of these earnings came from only the top 1% of films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Small and medium-budget films, especially those without well-known actors, struggle to be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

A major contributor to this is the inflated fees of Bollywood superstars. Half of a film's budget can be spent on paying a single star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. For example, ₹600 million of *Khel Khel Mein*'s ₹1 billion budget went to Akshay Kumar's fees alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Similarly, Prabhas received ₹1.5 billion for *Adipurush*, compared to Kriti Sanon's ₹30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This leaves minimal funds for story, direction, screenplay, and VFX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

Many films chasing the "hit formula" with massive budgets have flopped, including *Adipurush* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, *Ganapath* (₹2 billion budget, ₹100 million earned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, *Shehzada* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, *Selfie* (₹1 billion budget, ₹240 million earned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, *Tejas* (₹700 million budget, ₹60 million earned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, and *Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan* (₹3.5 billion budget, ₹1.02 billion earned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This highlights that even the formula does not guarantee success and that the core issue is the industry's greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## [[Challenges faced by independent and smallbudget films | Challenges for Independent Cinema]]

### Limited Theatrical Release and Rising Ticket Prices
Independent and small-budget films face immense difficulties in securing theatrical releases and prime-time slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Often, they are removed from cinemas after only a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This prevents them from gaining word-of-mouth publicity, which was historically crucial for films like *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge* to become classics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. Films that have won national or international awards, such as *All That Breathes* or *Khudiram Bose*, often do not get a chance to be screened in Indian cinemas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

The rising cost of movie tickets further exacerbates the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Cinema-going, once a weekly activity for the middle class, has become a rare "picnic" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This system, characterized by big budgets, big actors, and expensive tickets, eliminates the possibility for films like *Bheja Fry* (₹5.4 million budget, ₹125 million earned via word-of-mouth) or *Kahaani* (₹80 million budget, ₹1.04 billion earned) to achieve success today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

## Decline in Genre Diversity and Imagination

Bollywood is experiencing a significant decline in diversity and variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. The industry now predominantly produces films based on only three genres: melodramatic action, melodramatic comedy, or melodramatic patriotic films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Genres like horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, animated films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, superhero films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>, and even films about aliens (like *Koi Mil Gaya*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a> are rarely seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The lack of films for children is particularly noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. This erosion of imaginative content is what truly signifies Bollywood's "loss of soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

Even OTT platforms are now less willing to buy films without proven box office success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, trapping quality films that cannot get a fair theatrical release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

## Conclusion

The current state of Bollywood reflects rising monopoly due to the greed of film studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, jeopardizing the industry's sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. To ensure a sustainable future, Bollywood must become more inclusive, supporting low-budget films from production to release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. This approach would allow more films to be made, create more jobs, reduce ticket prices, and expand the audience base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Examples like Aamir Khan's production of *Laapataa Ladies* show that content-driven, small-budget films can still succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. A return to unique, meaningful, and content-driven cinema with strong music and acting is essential to save the Hindi film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

A heinous crime involving a 31-year-old trainee doctor at Kolkata's R.G. Kar hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> shocked the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, leading to widespread [[protests_and_citizens_rights_in_india | protests]] across the country, including West Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Initial Response and Protests
Following the incident, doctors went on strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Protesters faced attacks from "goons," and the hospital itself was ransacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Police arrested 25 individuals in connection with the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Mamata Banerjee, who holds the positions of Chief Minister, Home Minister, and Health Minister of West Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, came under public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Peculiarly, she led a protest rally herself after the incident, the purpose of which remained unclear to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Accused and Investigation
The primary accused in the case was identified as Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer in the West Bengal Police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Roy had a history of domestic violence, with three previous marriages ending due to such issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Questions were raised about the criteria for his recruitment as a civic volunteer given his past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Police used CCTV footage, his Bluetooth device, and DNA samples to arrest him, and he subsequently confessed to his crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:01:03]</a>. Another concern was his alleged unrestricted access to various departments within the hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Demand for CBI Transfer and High Court Intervention
A few days after the incident, there was a public demand to transfer the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:12]</a>. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee initially stated she had no problem with the transfer and would consider it if the police failed to make progress in a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:22]</a>.

However, the Calcutta High Court intervened, ordering the case to be handed over to the CBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:30]</a>. The High Court cited a "lack of trustworthiness of the police" as a reason for its decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The court also highlighted that public demand for a CBI transfer indicated a loss of trust in the state police, attributing this as a failure of the Home Minister and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Controversy Surrounding Hospital Leadership
Further questions arose regarding the appointment of Sandeep Ghosh as the principal of R.G. Kar Medical College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:47]</a>. Ghosh was accused of corruption and of running the college in a "mafia-like" manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:53]</a>. Despite alleged attempts to transfer him, these were reportedly stopped due to his suspected closeness to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:02:00]</a>.

In this particular case, Ghosh was accused of atrocities, including trying to suppress the matter and portray it as a suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:07]</a>. The victim's parents were denied access to her body for hours, and there was a delay in filing the First Information Report (FIR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:13]</a>. Despite being removed from R.G. Kar, Ghosh was then appointed principal of Calcutta National College, which the Calcutta High Court deemed illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:23]</a>. The High Court subsequently sent Sandeep Ghosh on an extended leave of absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:28]</a>.

The West Bengal government formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the corruption charges against Sandeep Ghosh, with a report due in one month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:37]</a>. The CBI also interrogated him four times in connection with the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Government Initiatives and Supreme Court Cognizance
In response to widespread demands for justice and women's safety in workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:48]</a>, the West Bengal government announced some initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:51]</a>. The Supreme Court took *suo-moto* cognizance of the matter, issuing strong statements about the constitutional right to equality for women and their safety at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:03:01]</a>, emphasizing that the country cannot wait for another such incident for "ground level changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:05]</a>.

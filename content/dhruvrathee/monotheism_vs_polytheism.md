From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

The concept of monotheism, believing in only one God, stands in contrast to polytheism, which involves the belief in multiple gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:22">[02:20:22]</a>.

## Introduction to Abrahamic Religions

The core of many faiths revolves around understanding the nature of God and humanity's relationship with the divine. The Abrahamic religions — Christianity, Islam, and Judaism — are classified as monotheistic faiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The term "Abrahamic" is derived from Prophet Abraham, who is believed by many to be the first figure to preach [[interpreting_religious_scriptures | monotheism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

A [[religious_scriptural_stories_and_myths | common prophet]] in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism is Prophet Abraham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Many, especially Jews and some Christians, believe Prophet Abraham was the first prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. However, some Christians suggest Enoch was the first prophet, citing Genesis chapter 5, verse 22, which states, "Enoch walked with God for 300 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Muslims believe Adam was the first Prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Adam is considered the first human being by believers of these three religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

> [!example] A Shared Narrative Riddle
> A [[religious_scriptural_stories_and_myths | religious story]] is presented about a man whose name ends in "AM" (e.g., Ram, Abraham), his wife whose name starts with "S" (e.g., Sita, Sarah), and a relative whose name starts with "L" (e.g., Lakshman, Lot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. They are exiled and travel south, where a king whose name ends in "N" (e.g., Ravan, Pharaoh) takes the woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The woman is eventually freed, and the man and woman return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This story, while initially appearing to be the Ramayana, also fits the story of Prophet Abraham, Sarah, Lot, and Pharaoh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Early Stories of Creation and Flood

In Abrahamic traditions, God created Adam from soil and breathed life into him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden, with one condition: not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. God created Eve from Adam's bone to be his helper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. A snake misled Eve into eating the forbidden fruit, which she then gave to Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. As punishment, God cursed the snake, Eve (with intense labor pains), and Adam (with lifelong toil), and expelled them from Eden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

Later, God regretted creating humans due to their wickedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. He decided to wipe out the Earth with a great flood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. However, Noah (or Nuh in Islam) was a good person in God's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. God instructed Noah to build a large ark and bring his family and a male and female of every living creature, along with sufficient food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. It rained for 40 days and 40 nights, submerging the Earth for 150 days, but Noah's Ark survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

## The Story of Abram and Idol Worship

A significant story involving Abram (later Abraham) recounts his act of breaking idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. This narrative is found in Midrash Genesis Rabbah chapter 38 and, with differences, in Qur'an chapter 21, verses 51-70, though not explicitly in the Hebrew Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

In this story, Abram's father, Terah, was an idol maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. While in charge of his father's shop, Abram questioned a 50-year-old man buying an idol less than a year old, shaming him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Later, Abram broke all the idols except the largest one, placing the stick in its hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. When people returned, Abram feigned ignorance, suggesting the largest idol broke the others, prompting the people to admit idols cannot speak or fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Abram then revealed his point: "Why do you worship these idols when these statues cannot speak or do anything? You will not gain anything from it, nor will you suffer any loss from it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Abram was then thrown into a fire, but God saved him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

### Interpretations of Idolatry

*   **Judaism and Islam**: Due to this story, idol worship is not practiced in Judaism and Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
*   **Hinduism**: Some conservative Muslims and Hindus may categorize Hindus as 'Kafirs' because they worship idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. However, Hindus do not worship the physical idol itself; they worship God *through* the idol, similar to how one remembers a father by looking at his photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. Acharya Prashanth states, "The idol has been a good means to reach the formless. And when the idol is worshipped, it is never said that the idol is the true God. It is said that I will use this idol to reach the true God. I will use the idol to reach the formless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.
*   **Christianity**: Christians do not consider using idols wrong, as seen with Jesus and Mary idols in churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Exodus chapter 20, verses 4 and 5, forbid making idols of *other things* or bowing down to them, not necessarily idols of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. In fact, Exodus chapter 25, verses 17-22, describes God commanding Prophet Moses to make Cherub idols, indicating God's lack of problem with using images to worship Him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.
*   **Quranic Interpretation of Idolatry**: Quran Surah 4, Ayat 48, states, "Do not associate partners with God," meaning not to worship anyone other than God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. Additionally, the Quran warns against "idolizing" property, wealth (chapter 18, verses 32-46), or one's desires and ego (chapter 25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   **Monotheism in Hinduism**: Monotheistic sentiments are found in Hindu scriptures. Rigveda, Mandal 1, Shlok 46, mentions "The Rishi is called by many names - Agni, Yam, Indra, Varun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>. Yajurveda, Chapter 32, states, "He is Agni, Aditya, which is Sun, He is Vayu, Chandrama, Jal, There is no one like him. His name is great, He is in all beings. Before him there was nothing. All people have been created by that God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. Similarly, Hinduism also warns against idolizing one's ego or material desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. These examples highlight fundamental alignments between religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

## Defining "Kafir"

The term "Kafir" means one who disbelieves in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. While atheists are considered Kafirs in Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, the notion that all non-Muslims are Kafirs is a wrong perception often spread to instill fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. From a liberal Muslim perspective, anyone who believes in any religion and worships God, regardless of the name given to God, is a Muslim as they are submitting to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. Qur'an chapter 2, verse 62, counts Jews, Christians, and Sabians among believers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

## [[interpreting_religious_scriptures | Interpretations of Violence in Religious Texts]]

Some passages in [[comparison_of_abrahamic_religions | religious scriptures]] appear to promote violence:
*   **Quran**: Chapter 9, verse 5, says, "Kill the Mushrik, meaning disbelievers, wherever you find them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.
*   **Hebrew Bible**: Book 1: Samuel, Chapter 15, conveys God's message to Saul: "Now go attack the Amalekites, and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.
*   **Christianity**: Gospel of Matthew Chapter 10, verses 34-36, Jesus tells his disciples, "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.
*   **Bhagavad Gita**: Chapter 2, Shloka 31 to 38, Lord Krishna tells Arjun, "Happy are the Kshatriyas, the warriors to whom such fighting opportunities come unsought, opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.

These lines are heavily contextual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>. For example, Krishna's words to Arjun are during the Mahabharata war, and Prophet Muhammad's words are in the context of the fight with the Quraysh tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>. Jesus's line has a metaphorical meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>. No scripture actually advocates killing innocent people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>. These verses are often deliberately misinterpreted by terrorists and orthodox individuals to influence violence and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>.

Wahiduddin Khan, an Islamic scholar awarded the Padma Vibhushan by the Indian government, states that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>. In contrast, figures like Osama Bin Laden brainwash people by misrepresenting Islam's teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. Similarly, understanding Hinduism from appropriate scholars promotes love, while evil interpretations can incite violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>.

## The Legacy of Abraham

God told Abram to leave his home and go to a place God would show him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>. Abram, his wife Sarai, and nephew Lot traveled to Egypt to escape famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>. In Egypt, Abram asked Sarai to pretend to be his sister to save his life because of her beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>. Pharaoh's officials took Sarai to the palace, and Abram received good treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. However, serious diseases struck Pharaoh's house, and upon realizing Sarai was Abram's wife, Pharaoh expelled them from Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

Abram and Sarai were childless. Sarai gave Abram her slave woman, Hagar, and a son, Ishmael, was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>. God then made an agreement with Abram, renaming him Abraham and Sarai to Sarah, promising him to be the father of many nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>. God promised Abraham all the land of Canaan, encompassing present-day Israel, West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, and southern areas of Syria and Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>. This promise became significant for the Zionist movement, which claimed the land for Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.

Later, God promised Sarah a son, and Isaac was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a>. Due to Ishmael's attitude, Sarah asked Abraham to send him away, which God affirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:00">[24:39:00]</a>. Hagar and Ishmael went to the desert, where God arranged water for them and promised Hagar that Ishmael would make a great nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>.

> This is the point where the [[comparison_of_abrahamic_religions | Abrahamic religions]] separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>:
> *   **Jews and Christians**: Believe they are descendants of Isaac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>. Jews trace their lineage to Jacob (renamed Israel), Isaac's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>. Christians believe Jesus is a descendant of Isaac and consider themselves spiritual descendants through faith in Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.
> *   **Muslims**: Believe Abraham and Ishmael together built the Kaaba in Mecca, the most sacred site in Islam, and trace their spiritual lineage to Ishmael <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.

Recent media reports falsely claimed that YouTuber Dhruv Rathee was set to make a wildcard entry in Bigg Boss OTT 2, with headlines appearing in outlets like India TV, India Times, ABP News, India Today, Zoom TV, Pinkvilla, and Economic Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This news was untrue, as Rathee confirmed he had not been invited nor expressed interest in joining the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This incident highlights the questionable standards of some Indian media, which publish unverified information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The Economic Times even included a disclaimer, stating they don't take responsibility for third-party content and advise readers to verify information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Dhruv Rathee stated that he would never participate in "such a nonsense show" regardless of the payment, considering it a "very cheap way to earn money and fame" that has a negative [[impact_of_reality_tv_shows_on_society_and_mental_health | impact on society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. He aims to explain the problematic concept of the show, discuss if it is [[the_artificial_and_scripted_nature_of_bigg_boss | scripted]], and advise against watching such programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Origin and Inspiration

The concept of Big Brother, and subsequently Bigg Boss, traces its roots to George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel, *1984* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The book depicts a dictatorial government led by an unknown "Big Brother," under whose constant surveillance citizens live, as famously echoed by the slogan "Big Brother is watching you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Orwell criticized governments like Stalin and Hitler, exposing their techniques of propaganda, constant surveillance, historical revisionism, and the creation of a cult personality around a supreme leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Political opponents were often subjected to conspiracy theories and declared anti-national <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

In 1999, developers in the Netherlands adapted this concept into a TV show called "Big Brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The show's premise involved individuals living in a house under continuous surveillance and the command of "Big Brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It also drew inspiration from other reality shows like MTV's *The Real World* and the Swedish show *Expedition Robinson* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Big Brother gained international popularity, leading to adaptations in numerous countries including America, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, China, and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. India's entertainment industry followed suit, creating "Bigg Boss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. It expanded into various Indian languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, and later into an OTT (Over-The-Top) platform version called "Bigg Boss OTT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Core Concept: Exploiting Human Nature

Unlike Orwell's warning, shows like Big Brother and Bigg Boss offer a cheap form of entertainment heavily laden with two psychological elements: [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Sadism]] and [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Voyeurism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Everyday Sadism

[[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Sadism]] is defined as "the tendency to derive pleasure from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. While extreme forms are associated with psychopaths, psychological studies, such as a 2013 study in *Psychological Science*, have identified a less extreme category: [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Sadism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Examples of [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Sadism]] include:
*   Ancient Roman audiences cheering for gladiators to be killed in the Colosseum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   People gathering to watch street fights instead of intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   Bullies in schools or colleges who enjoy humiliating others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   Individuals who abuse animals without reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   Bosses who criticize employees for no reason other than to inflict mental pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   Mob lynching incidents, where crowds beat accused individuals, often deriving sadistic pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   People celebrating the deaths of public figures they dislike, finding happiness in another's demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   YouTube channels built on insulting, abusing, or bullying others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   Everyday sadists preferring violent video games or torture films like the *Saw* series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

Bigg Boss explicitly exploits [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Sadism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Contestants are constantly encouraged to fight, engage in physical altercations, and even throw objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Tasks are designed for humiliation, such as throwing chili powder on faces, bathing in cow dung, or drinking from a dog bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The show features body shaming, "backbiting," misogyny, homophobia, and even incidents of contestants tampering with others' belongings or privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Toxic and often fake relationships are also promoted to boost TRP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Voyeurism

[[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Voyeurism]] involves "taking cheap pleasure in watching other people's lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This is seen in:
*   People seeking out leaked MMS videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   The popularity of daily vlogs, where viewers enjoy observing mundane aspects of YouTubers' personal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Some vloggers even exploit this by filming private moments like a child crying or a family fight for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   The fascination with CCTV footage of crimes or accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

Bigg Boss exploits [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Voyeurism]] extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. For instance, Bigg Boss 16 had 98 cameras installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Contestants are recorded 24/7, and viewers can watch live feeds with multiple camera options, catering to those with ample free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Contestants are encouraged to share personal secrets on national television for content and TRP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## [[the_artificial_and_scripted_nature_of_bigg_boss | The Artificial and Scripted Nature of Bigg Boss]]

Despite being a "reality" TV show, very little about Bigg Boss is genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Lack of Natural Behavior:** Contestants are aware of constant surveillance, making natural behavior impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Forced Conflict:** An artificial competitive environment is created, compelling participants to insult, backbite, and fight to "perform" and advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Real-life interactions in such a confined space would rarely involve so much conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Casting and Editing:** Contestants are not chosen via auditions but by makers based on their potential to generate intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Hours of footage are heavily edited into short episodes, selecting only the most dramatic moments to attract viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. This editing manipulates public perception and influences voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Pre-determined Outcomes:** Rules are bent, eliminations are skipped, and contestants are brought back or introduced as wildcards based solely on the show's "saleability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Tasks are also designed for entertainment value, prioritizing conflict and personal drama over intellectual discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

Many former contestants have spoken about the show's manipulation:
*   Siddharth Yadav, a former contestant, was criticized for mocking jobless people who watch Salman Khan's movies, only to end up in the Bigg Boss house himself, a place deemed "most apt" for his type of person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Sushant Divgikar (Bigg Boss 8), a model, singer, dancer, psychologist, and Mr Gay India 2014 winner, was quickly eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. He noted that the show's concept requires controversy, not dignified behavior, stating that the collective IQ of his season's contestants was "less than room temperature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav (Bigg Boss 13) also left early, saying the show's format turns "humans into devils" and that advancement requires insulting and humiliating others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
*   Rahul Bhatt (Bigg Boss 4) refused to "make a fool of myself" for entertainment, highlighting that channels only keep controversial or romantic figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   Aman Verma (Bigg Boss 9) revealed a pre-planned deal to stay only six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.
*   Shekhar Suman, a host for Bigg Boss 16's Sunday special, admitted he had to follow a script provided by the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   Former contestants Shweta Tiwari (winner, Bigg Boss 4), Aashka Goradia (Bigg Boss 6), and Hina Khan (runner-up, Bigg Boss 11) confirmed the show is heavily edited, often misrepresenting long conversations and fabricating misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Aashka Goradia cited an instance where editors made it appear she was a lesbian after she applied balm to another female contestant's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   Shilpa Saklani (Bigg Boss 7) acknowledged that while not strictly scripted, contestants know they must "react and give content," "fight with each other," and "be assertive" to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## [[impact_of_reality_tv_shows_on_society_and_mental_health | Impact of Reality TV Shows]]

The consumption of such content has a significant [[impact_of_reality_tv_shows_on_society_and_mental_health | impact on society and mental health]]. Psychiatrist Dr. Marcia Sirota claims that just as junk food harms physical health, "bad reality TV shows" negatively affect the brain, making viewers ruder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Seeing celebrities gain fame and wealth through abusive and self-serving behavior can convince audiences that such tactics are the best way to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

A study by psychologist Brian Gibson at Central Michigan University concluded that watching reality TV shows increases aggression in viewers, even more so than violent media or crime shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

The [[impact_of_reality_tv_shows_on_society_and_mental_health | mental health]] of contestants is also severely affected. Many have reported dealing with mental health issues post-show, regretting revealing personal secrets, or struggling with public perception after being portrayed as villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Contestants like Shamita Shetty, Sana Khan, Kushal Tandon, Nikki Tamboli, Kavita Kaushik, Shalin Bhanot, Rahul Vaidya, Himanshi Khurana, Apurva Agnihotri, and Shilpa Shaklani all sought therapy after their participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

Viewers are encouraged to choose their content wisely, understanding the potential positive or negative impacts of their entertainment choices on their mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

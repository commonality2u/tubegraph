The [[Discovery of the Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley Civilization]], a Bronze Age civilization primarily located in present-day Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Northwest India, existed for at least 5,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. It was an advanced society with sophisticated [[Urban Planning in the Indus Valley|urban planning]] and a unique script, the [[Mysteries of the Harappan Language|Indus Script]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. However, around 1900 BC, this great civilization began a rapid decline, ultimately ceasing to exist by 600 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. While the exact cause remains unknown, several theories attempt to explain its disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## Signs of Decline

Archaeological records indicate a swift downfall between 1900 BC and 1300 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. During this period, evidence of decline includes:
*   A halt in city planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   Lack of maintenance for sewers and drainage systems on roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   The Great Bath being filled with waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   The cessation of trade links with Mesopotamia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   By 1800 BC, most cities were empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   Abandonment of their writing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a> and standardized weights and building ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Leading Theories

### 1. River Drying Up

One prominent theory suggests that the river vital to the civilization's existence began to dry up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. This may have been the Saraswati River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Potential reasons for the river's disappearance include:
*   **Tectonic plate shifts:** Geological activity could have altered the river's course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   **Natural course change:** Rivers can naturally shift their paths over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

If this theory holds true, it is assumed that the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation migrated eastwards and settled near the Ganga River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### 2. Deforestation

Another theory points to widespread deforestation as a contributing factor to the civilization's demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The inhabitants may have cut down excessive amounts of forest for brick production and cattle grazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, rendering the area uninhabitable due to loss of greenery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### 3. Fatal Disease

A third hypothesis posits that a widespread fatal disease might have wiped out a significant portion, or even the entire population, of the civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Diseases like malaria or cholera were common occurrences in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, and historical plagues, such as the Red Plague, are known to have decimated many civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. It's possible for such outbreaks to eliminate 70% to 80% of a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

While these theories provide potential explanations, the precise reason for the decline and ultimate end of this unique civilization remains an unsolved mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. After its decline, its settlements were buried, and new cities and civilizations emerged on top of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

The [[Electoral Bond Scam|Electoral Bond Scam]] has been described as not only the biggest scam in India but also the biggest scam in the world, a claim made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's husband, an economist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This scam is not merely about the theft of public funds or the awarding of government tenders to unworthy companies; it also encompasses instances where companies were permitted to steal through tax evasion or were extorted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Crucially, some aspects of this scam involve actions that directly jeopardized citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The issue of [[Substandard and Dangerous Medicines|substandard and dangerous medicines]] leading to fatalities is highlighted as a serious concern, challenging the notion of "God's will" when poor quality medications are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This situation points to severe [[Government Regulatory Failures|government regulatory failures]] where oversight of pharmaceutical quality is neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Case Study: Zydus Cadila and Substandard Remdesivir

During the second wave of Covid in India in May 2021, doctors in Uttar Pradesh, including anesthesiologist Jitendra Pal, reported strange symptoms in patients who had received the anti-viral medication Remdesivir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Patients developed high fever, shivering, and plummeting blood oxygen levels within an hour of the first shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This pattern was observed in multiple hospitals, with investigations tracing the reactions to the same batch (V100167) of Remdesivir manufactured by Zydus Cadila in Gujarat, procured by the UP government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Doctors stopped using the problematic batch, and patients' conditions improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Similar incidents occurred in other Uttar Pradesh hospitals and subsequently in states like Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Bihar, involving different batches of Remdesivir from Cadila (V100153, 156, 166, 167, 170, or L100148) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Regulatory Inaction and Electoral Bonds

Despite widespread concerns from hospitals, state regulators in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Gujarat showed little action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Only Bihar's regulators raised a red flag, testing batch V100167 and discovering it contained bacterial endotoxins, compounds capable of causing fever and septic shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

A case was filed against Zydus Cadila in Patna's civil court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, the Gujarat FDCA, responsible for monitoring the quality of medicines from its manufacturing unit, failed to conduct any testing despite being informed by Bihar's regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The Gujarat FDCA did not recall the medicines, as required by the Drugs and Cosmetics law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Adding to the controversy, the World Health Organization (WHO) had advised against using Remdesivir in November 2020, based on a study of over 14,000 people across 35 countries, concluding it was not effective against Covid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:06:02]</a>. Yet, the Indian government not only approved it but also planned to increase its production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The connection to electoral bonds emerged when data revealed that Zydus Cadila donated ₹180 million to the BJP, which was in power both centrally and in Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The company also donated ₹30 million to Congress (then in power in Rajasthan) and ₹80 million to BJP's ally, Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM), which governs Sikkim, a pharma hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### Other Pharma Companies and Political Donations

Several other pharmaceutical companies with quality control issues have made significant [[Political Donations by Pharma Companies|political donations]].

*   **Glenmark Pharmaceuticals**: Received five notices for [[Substandard and Dangerous Medicines|substandard medicines]] between 2022 and 2023, primarily from the Maharashtra Food and Drugs Administration. The company bought electoral bonds worth ₹97.5 million in November 2022, all encashed by the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Torrent Pharma**: A Gujarat-based company whose antiplatelet medicine Deplatt 150 failed a salicylic acid test in 2018. The US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) also warned the company in October 2019 due to repeated quality failures in its manufacturing units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Despite these warnings, the BJP government in Gujarat took no action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Between May 2019 and January 2024, Torrent Pharma bought electoral bonds worth ₹775 million, with ₹610 million going to the BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Cipla**: Received four show-cause notices for its medicines. In August 2018, its RC cough syrup failed to meet standards. In July 2021, it received two notices for its Remdesivir medicine, found to have insufficient active ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Cipla bought electoral bonds worth ₹392 million, donating ₹370 million to the BJP and ₹22 million to Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Notably, the company bought bonds in November 2022 after the BJP coalition government was formed in Maharashtra, having previously bought bonds in July and October 2019 when the BJP was in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Hetero Group**: Received six notices from Maharashtra's FDA for [[Substandard and Dangerous Medicines|substandard drugs]], including three for its Remdesivir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Despite these violations, which should have led to the cancellation of its manufacturing license, the company merely recalled the medicines and bought electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The Hetero group donated ₹1.2 billion to BRS (then in power in Telangana), whose founder and chairman were subsequently given Rajya Sabha seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. When the BJP returned to power in Maharashtra in 2022, they encashed ₹150 million from Hetero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Tragic Consequences: Contaminated Cough Syrups

The consequences of lax quality control are starkly illustrated by incidents involving contaminated cough syrups.

### Uzbekistan and Marion Biotech

In December 2022, 18 children in Uzbekistan died after consuming [[Substandard and Dangerous Medicines|substandard cough syrup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. In January 2023, the WHO linked these deaths to two contaminated cough syrups, Ambronol Syrup and Dok1-Max Syrup, manufactured by Uttar Pradesh-based Marion Biotech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Laboratory analysis revealed high amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, industrial-grade chemicals toxic to humans, typically used in detergents or paints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Marion Biotech had sourced these ingredients from Maya Chemtech India, a company not licensed to sell pharmaceutical-grade materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

Uzbekistan's response was swift and severe: banning all drugs from the importer (Quramax Medical), canceling its license, destroying remaining medicines, and sentencing 23 people to imprisonment, including Quramax's Indian Executive Director, Raghvendra Pratar Singh, who received 20 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

In India, investigations found 22 samples of Marion Biotech's cough syrup to be adulterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. While the Pharmaceutical Export Promotion Council of India suspended Marion Biotech's registration, and Uttar Pradesh authorities cancelled its manufacturing license, the outcome has been less stringent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Three employees were arrested and later released on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The Allahabad High Court prevented the arrest of directors Sachin Jain and Jaya Jain without conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Shockingly, by October 2023, the Uttar Pradesh government allowed the factory to reopen, with the restriction that it cannot manufacture products containing propylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Jammu & Kashmir and Digital Vision Pharma

A similar tragedy occurred in Udhampur district of Jammu & Kashmir in September 2023, where approximately 12 children, some as young as two months old, died after consuming a cough syrup from Digital Vision Pharma Company that contained high amounts of diethylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This company also used industrial-grade ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Despite the deaths, it took three years to file a charge sheet, and four years later, no one has been found guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Digital Vision Pharma had received at least 16 warnings from drug regulators in Maharashtra and Gujarat prior to this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

### Widespread Quality Concerns

The Central Drug Standard Control Organisation's tests in December 2023 found that 54 pharma companies had failed export quality tests for cough syrups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This widespread failure threatens India's long-held reputation as the "Pharmacy of the World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Government Response to Quality Issues

Instead of tightening quality control, the government passed the "Jan Vishwas Bill" in August 2023, which aims to ease penalties for low-quality drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Public health activists, such as Dinesh Thakur, criticized this move, arguing that such offenses should not be decriminalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The most problematic amendment was to Section 27D of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, which previously allowed for 1-2 years imprisonment for failing lab tests but now permits an out-of-court compromise through payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

The connection between [[Political Donations by Pharma Companies|political donations by pharma companies]] and [[Government Regulatory Failures|regulatory failures]] is explicit. The combined donations from pharmaceutical companies to political parties total ₹9.45 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Prime Minister Modi's assertion that electoral bonds, despite "imperfections," allowed for transparency in funding flows is challenged by the fact that this information only became public after the Supreme Court declared the scheme unconstitutional and struck it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Had the Supreme Court not intervened, the scheme would have remained secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

> [!INFO] Transparency through Litigation
> The revelation of who donated how much to whom via electoral bonds was only possible because the Supreme Court declared the scheme unconstitutional and ordered the data to be disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

This detailed overview relies on the investigative efforts of organizations like Project Electoral Bond, a collaborative effort involving Newslaundry, Scroll, The News Minute, and other independent journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

Ratan Tata, the grandson of [[jamsetji_tatas_business_ethics_and_innovations | Jamsetji Tata]], began working for the family business in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. His capabilities were recognized early on, leading to his appointment as chairman of the [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]] in 1991, succeeding JRD Tata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Early Assignments and Turnarounds

Before becoming chairman, Ratan Tata was tasked with reviving struggling parts of the [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]].

*   **Nelco (Electronics)** In 1971, Ratan Tata was assigned to turn around Nelco, the group's electronics arm, which had seen its market share fall to 2% from 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. He decided to cease radio manufacturing and invest in new technologies like satellite communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Within three years, by 1975, Nelco's market share returned to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. However, the declaration of the Emergency subsequently impacted Nelco's business, leading to its eventual closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Empress Mill (Cotton)** Ratan Tata was also given the responsibility to revive the Empress Mill, a cotton mill set up by [[jamsetji_tatas_business_ethics_and_innovations | Jamsetji Tata]] in Nagpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Although this mission narrowly failed to be successful, his efforts did not go unnoticed by senior management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Leadership in the Era of Liberalization

Ratan Tata's tenure as chairman began in 1991, coinciding with India's economic liberalization, when the country shifted from a socialist to a capitalist model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. To protect the [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]] companies from international takeovers, Ratan Tata reversed JRD Tata's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. He significantly increased Tata Sons' ownership in all [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]] subsidiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This decision proved highly successful, allowing the [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]] to not only survive but also embark on global acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Global Acquisitions

Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]] made significant international acquisitions:

*   **Tetley Tea** The English Tetley Tea company was acquired by the [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]] for $12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   **Corus Group** Tata Group acquired Corus, a major European steel company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)** In an notable instance, the workers of the UK-based car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover preferred the [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]] to take over the company, despite receiving offers from other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Social Upliftment and Innovation

Ratan Tata also demonstrated the [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]]'s core philosophy of social upliftment through innovation. In 2003, after seeing a family of four struggling on a scooter in the rain, Ratan Tata was inspired to launch the Nano Car five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Marketed as the world's cheapest car at â‚¹100,000, its aim was to provide the lower-middle class with an affordable car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. However, the marketing strategy, which highlighted its affordability, inadvertently created a perception that made potential buyers hesitant to be seen as purchasing the "cheapest" car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

The [[history_and_expansion_of_tata_group | Tata Group]] generally hasn't prioritized branding strategies, as evidenced by many of its institutions and businesses not being named after the Tata family, such as the Indian Institute of Science or the Taj Hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The city of Jamshedpur, named after [[jamsetji_tatas_business_ethics_and_innovations | Jamsetji Tata]], was named by the British Viceroy of India, not by the Tatas themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

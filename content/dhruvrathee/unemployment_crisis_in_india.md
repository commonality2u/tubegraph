Unemployment has emerged as the most significant issue in India today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. According to the India Employment Report 2024, one out of every three youths in the country is unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The unemployment rate for graduates has reached 29.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite India being the world's fifth-largest economy and aiming for a $5 trillion economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, there are insufficient jobs available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## The Paradox of a Growing Economy

India, with its 1.4 billion people, represents a massive market for various goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Foreign companies, like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola India, generate billions in revenue in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. PepsiCo's yearly revenue in India is ₹80 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, and Coca-Cola India's exceeds ₹128 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Yet, many Indian youths struggle to find jobs even with salaries as low as ₹12,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Government Promises Versus Reality

Prime Minister Modi had promised millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, some media channels, like ABP News, have "fact-checked" this claim, asserting that PM Modi only criticized the previous government for not providing employment, rather than promising jobs himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This contradicts past BJP election campaigns, such as one by BJP Haryana, which explicitly campaigned on providing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Despite these promises, Haryana currently holds the highest unemployment rate in the country, at 37.4% as of December 2022, according to CMI data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. PM Modi's own past statements from 2016 and 2017 reveal commitments to the "Make in India" campaign for local employment and an aim to create jobs for over a billion young hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Many TV news channels often avoid discussing unemployment or attempt to protect the government's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, Sudhir Chaudhary, a news anchor, blamed citizens for preferring government jobs due to potential bribes and for lacking skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. He suggested that people want government jobs for the opportunity to take bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> and cited a 2019 survey where 1 in 2 Indians acknowledged bribing a government employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He also attributed unemployment to a lack of skills, despite PM Modi's "Skill India" initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Demand for Jobs vs. Educational Infrastructure

Annually, approximately 28.5 million students enroll in higher secondary schools in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Including dropouts from secondary and primary levels, the total number of students entering the workforce or seeking further education is estimated at 33-34 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. However, the country's educational infrastructure struggles to accommodate this demand.

### Medical Education
In July 2023, there were about 108,000 MBBS seats and a total of around 140,000 MBBS plus BDS seats nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. In contrast, over 2 million applications were received for NEET UG in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, meaning only 1 in 15 applicants secured a seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. PG seats are even scarcer, with only 67,800 available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The issue is compounded by the high fees of private medical colleges. The median annual fee for a private medical college in India is ₹1.15 million, costing almost ₹6 million for a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Deemed Universities have even higher median fees at ₹2.1 million per year, totaling over ₹10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. With 90% of Indians earning less than ₹25,000 per month, most families cannot afford these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Engineering Education
Despite a growing population, the total number of seats in engineering colleges has decreased over the last five years, from 1.465 million in 2017-18 to 1.253 million in 2021-22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Moreover, a significant number of seats remain vacant (33% in 2021-22, approximately 421,000 seats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Reasons for vacant seats and unemployability:
1.  **High Fees**: IIT fees doubled in 2016, and private college fees can reach up to ₹2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
2.  **Low Quality Education**: Many private colleges have sub-standard or unqualified faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Only 44.51% of engineering college faculty have a PhD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
3.  **Faculty Shortage**: Prestigious IITs alone have 4,500 vacant faculty posts, with an overall 40.3% teaching positions vacant in 2021-22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
4.  **Inadequate Infrastructure**: AICTE reduced 40,000 government engineering seats in 2019 due to lack of proper faculty or infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. In Tamil Nadu, over 50% of engineering colleges lack adequate infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

As a result, more than 80% of Indian engineering graduates are not employable, often due to deficiencies in the educational system rather than individual capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. A 2019 report showed 60% of engineering graduates don't do internships, and only 3% possess new-age technological skills like AI or machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs)
ITIs offer skill-based training, but despite 15,000 institutes, total seating capacity is only 2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Similar to engineering colleges, about 50% of ITI seats are vacant, and most graduates are not employable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The combined capacity of medical, engineering, and ITI seats is less than 5 million, far short of the 30+ million eligible students annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Job Availability and Security

Even if educational gaps were bridged, job availability remains a challenge.
The manufacturing sector in India saw a 30% decrease in jobs, from 51 million in 2016 to 36 million in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

The [[impact_of_corporate_sector_on_job_availability | impact of the corporate sector on job availability]] has also been severe. During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 120 million Indians lost jobs in April 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, and 10 million more by June 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Post-Covid, layoffs continued, with 6% of IT sector contract workers losing jobs in Q1 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, over 11,000 Indian startup employees laid off by June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, and over 200,000 tech employees globally by August 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Major IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCL, and Tech Mahindra reported negative hiring numbers in October 2023, despite high profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

This trend leads to significant workplace burnout. India ranks highest globally in workplace exhaustion, with 62% of employees reporting burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Indian workers often work the longest hours but earn the least <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Companies prioritize cost-cutting by overworking existing employees rather than hiring new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Corporate Growth vs. Job Creation

There is a clear pattern: as large companies grow, their job creation rate often falls.
*   **Adani Group**: Market capitalization of ₹11 trillion but only 43,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola**: Employees almost halved from 150,900 in 2012 to 82,000 in 2022, while profits increased by hundreds of billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Twitter**: Market capitalization of $41 billion (₹34 trillion) with only 1,500 employees globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **ITC**: Market capitalization of ₹54 trillion, owning over 25 brands, but employs only around 23,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Hindustan Unilever**: Market capitalization of ₹59 trillion, annual turnover of ₹580 billion, but only 21,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

These examples show that corporate white-collar jobs are limited, and the primary issue is a shortage of jobs, not a lack of skills among the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## Alternative Employment Models

RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat noted in February 2023 that government jobs account for only about 10% of total jobs, and other jobs for around 20%, stating no society can create more than 30% jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. PM Modi also suggested that operating a street food stall is a form of employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

Paradoxically, traditional and informal sectors demonstrate higher employment generation:
*   **Handicraft Market**: Indian handicraft market was $3.9 billion (₹320 billion) in 2022, employing 6.9 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This is 650 times more employment than Hindustan Unilever, despite a smaller turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Informal Sector**: NITI Aayog reports indicate that the informal sector, while contributing only 50% to the National Product, employs 90% of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Cooperatives and Small Enterprises**: Cooperatives like Lijjat Papad and Amul are lauded for large-scale employment generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Small and micro enterprises, along with local shopkeepers and stall owners, are crucial for job creation through a decentralized and localized economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. While PM Modi's "vocal for local" slogan is praised, the government's actions often fall short of promoting these sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## Solutions for the Government

To address the unemployment crisis, the government needs to take specific actions:
1.  **Fill Vacancies**: The central government has over 950,000 job vacancies, and state governments report over 6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. These should be filled across all sectors, from schools to courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Focus on Education**: Improve infrastructure in government schools, colleges, and institutes, and establish new ones to increase seats, especially in fields like engineering and medicine where demand outstrips supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
3.  **Promote Cooperatives and Small/Micro Enterprises**: Beyond providing loans, the government must actively provide means of production, storage space, and market mechanisms to promote these sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Historical examples like the Great Depression recovery in America, Mao's China, Singapore in the 1960s, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's public sector undertakings and nationalization of banks and LIC, and the White Revolution in India, demonstrate the necessity of government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
4.  **Encourage Small Businesses**: The government should reverse policies like reducing corporate tax from 30% to 22% in 2019, which led to a loss of over ₹1 trillion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. Instead, it should focus on supporting small businesses by addressing issues like skyrocketing gas and oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

## What Citizens Can Do

Individuals should not solely rely on government action for employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
1.  **Remove Betting/Gambling Apps**: Delete wasteful apps from your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
2.  **Learn a Skill**: Acquire practical skills, whether it's cooking for a cloud kitchen, baking, setting up a tea stall, or learning a trade like jewelry design or handicraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Initial low pay should be seen as an internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. The key is to start working with sincerity and dedication to build confidence and eventually start one's own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

Maharashtra faces significant [[economic_disparities_and_political_propaganda_in_india | economic disparities]] and challenges, particularly concerning poverty and the struggling middle class. Despite being the richest state in India by projected overall State GDP in FY 2024-25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> and ranking 12th in Net State Domestic Product Per Capita in 2022-23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, internal inequalities persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## Unequal Distribution of Wealth
A stark contrast exists within Maharashtra:
*   **Rich Districts** Six districts are considered rich: Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Raigad, Sindhudurg, and Kolhapur, all located in Western Maharashtra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Their annual GDP per capita is over ₹300,000, with Mumbai's exceeding ₹600,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Poor Districts** Seven districts are among the poorest: Washim, Gadchiroli, Nandurbar, Buldhana, Hingoli, Yavatmal, and Amravati. All but one are in Eastern Maharashtra (Vidarbha) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, where the annual GDP per capita is less than ₹300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. This region, despite being a farming area, is dry, leading to demands for statehood due to inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Urban Disparity** This inequality is also pronounced in cities. Mumbai, for instance, has the highest number of billionaires in Asia (92 billionaires) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, yet it also hosts Dharavi, Asia's largest slum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

## Impact on the Middle Class and Poor
The current political landscape often sees alliances like the Maha Yuti and Mahavikas Agadi throwing money at the poor through various schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. For example, the Mahavikas Agadi Alliance promised ₹3,000 to women and ₹4,000 to unemployed youth monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, while BJP's Maha Yuti Alliance offered ₹2,100 to women and senior citizens, ₹10,000 to students, and ₹1,250 to farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

However, this money often comes from taxes, disproportionately burdening the middle class, which is shrinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The [[unemployment_crisis_in_india | unemployment crisis in India]] is particularly severe in Maharashtra:
*   By 2022, unemployment among educated individuals in Maharashtra reached 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Those who find employment often face low salaries and heavy tax burdens (direct and indirect taxes leading to rising prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Deterioration of Public Services
The middle class, paying significant taxes, receives inadequate public services:
*   **Education** Government schools lack quality education, forcing parents to enroll children in private schools with exorbitant fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. For example, a school in Dadar, Mumbai, demanded ₹86,000 for first-grade admission, and another in Borivali charged ₹135,000 for third grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Transport** Overcrowding in Mumbai's local trains leads to tragic incidents, with over 51,800 deaths reported in the last 20 years from falling off trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Roads** Potholes are rampant due to poor drainage, despite government promises to make Mumbai roads pothole-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. In 16 months, only 9% of the target roads were completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Healthcare** Public hospitals suffer from unacceptable conditions, with incidents like 31 deaths in 72 hours at Dr. Shankar Ravchand Government Medical College and Hospital (including 16 children) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> and 18 deaths in 24 hours at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Environment** Maharashtra ranks second in India for deaths due to air pollution, with 149,118 lives lost in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Open garbage disposal and burning contribute significantly to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. A World Bank Group paper revealed that 97.6% of the Maharashtrian population breathes air beyond safe levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

These issues highlight a broader problem of [[infrastructure_and_public_service_issues_in_maharashtra | infrastructure and public service issues in Maharashtra]].

## Farmer Suicides and "Slavery"
Despite Maharashtra's prosperity, rural poverty is higher than the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. In 2022, Maharashtra accounted for 38% of all farming-related suicides in India, with 11,290 agricultural workers dying by suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. This suggests a form of "slavery" where farmers work hard but cannot live with dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Promises of debt waivers, while offering temporary relief, do not address the root causes of farmers' perennial debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Similarly, urban laborers, both informal and formal, are trapped in a cycle akin to slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions: Mission Swaraj
Inspired by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's dream of Swaraj (self-rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, a "Mission Swaraj" is proposed to transform Maharashtra. This mission emphasizes:
*   **Empowering Local Communities** and governance at the village level, with no discrimination based on religion, caste, or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Agriculture** Training farmers in techniques like soil testing, natural farming, drip irrigation, crop rotation, mulching, and multi-layer farming. This would involve appointing agricultural assistants to guide farmers in 44,728 villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Success stories like Hiware Bazar village, which transformed from a drought-stricken area through rainwater harvesting and water conservation, demonstrate feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **Market Access** Establishing local markets for direct farmer-consumer interaction and supporting farmer cooperatives and food processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Employment Generation** Promoting small and medium businesses and cottage industries, which are labor-intensive, to solve the [[unemployment_crisis_in_india | unemployment crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Quality Public Services**
    *   **Education** Providing free, quality education by reforming teacher appointments, appointing administrative assistants for non-teaching tasks, doubling permanent teachers, and revitalizing education department officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
    *   **Healthcare** Revamping hospitals to ensure quality care.
    *   **Law and Order** Increasing the police force (Maharashtra currently has ~230,000 personnel, but needs ~585,000 based on UN recommendations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, providing better training, and establishing dedicated investigation teams to achieve a crime-free Maharashtra with equal justice for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
    *   **Infrastructure** Improving roads, buses, and trains.
    *   **Cleanliness** Implementing proper waste management, composting, and cleaning initiatives (like Mumbai's beaches, drawing inspiration from Afroz Shah's work and Rwanda's community clean-up model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

These solutions emphasize investment in public services and job creation over merely distributing money, which burdens the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. It is argued that such steps are achievable if political leaders abandon crony capitalism and genuinely prioritize public welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. The success of this mission relies on voters holding politicians accountable for these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

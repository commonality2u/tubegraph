The credibility of Indian media has been called into question due to its propensity to publish unverified information and engage in sensationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Instances of [[fake_news_in_indian_media | fake news]] and the media's approach to information dissemination highlight a concerning standard in journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Fake News

The speaker, YouTuber Dhruv Rathee, shared a personal anecdote regarding widespread [[fake_news_in_indian_media | fake news]] about his purported wildcard entry into the reality show *Bigg Boss OTT 2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Numerous media outlets, including India TV, India Times, ABP News, India Today, Zoom TV, Pinkvilla, and Economic Times, published headlines confirming his entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Some headlines claimed "Dhruv Rathee Bigg Boss OTT Entry Confirmed!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

However, Rathee clarified that this information was entirely false; he had not been asked to join the show, nor had he expressed any desire to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This incident serves as a primary example of the media's willingness to publish unverified content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Shifting Responsibility

The Economic Times, one of the outlets that published the news, included a disclaimer stating: "This content is authored by a 3rd party. Please take all steps necessary to ascertain that any information and content provided is correct, updated, and verified." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> This disclaimer indicates that media houses are publishing material for which they do not take responsibility, effectively shifting the burden of verification onto the reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Broader Criticisms of Media Practices

### Distortion of Facts and Propaganda

The speaker draws parallels between current media practices and the dystopian themes in George Orwell's 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Orwell's novel criticized dictatorial governments that used propaganda, constant surveillance, and the rewriting of history to manipulate people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Key aspects include:
*   Running propaganda campaigns on "telescreens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Constant surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   Rewriting history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Presenting facts in a completely distorted manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Creating a cult personality around a supreme leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   Declaring political opponents anti-national and fabricating conspiracy theories against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

These elements resonate with criticisms of [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | media bias and misinformation in Indian politics]], especially in the context of [[false_narratives_and_media_portrayal_regarding_indias_global_leadership | false narratives]] and political narratives.

### Exploitation of Sadism and Voyeurism

The entertainment industry, including Indian media, is criticized for exploiting "Everyday Sadism" and "Voyeurism" for cheap entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

*   **Everyday Sadism:** Defined as deriving pleasure from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The media's portrayal of conflict and public humiliation, as seen in shows like *Bigg Boss*, is seen as catering to this aspect of human psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Enjoying street fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   Bullying others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   Mob lynching incidents where crowds inflict violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    *   Celebrating the deaths of political opponents or public figures, rather than merely criticizing their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    *   Creating content focused on insulting, abusing, or bullying others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
    *   The "torture tasks" and forced humiliation in reality shows like *Bigg Boss* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
    *   This is seen as a key component of [[selective_outrage_and_media_narratives_in_india | selective outrage and media narratives in India]].

*   **Voyeurism:** Defined as taking cheap pleasure in watching other people's lives, particularly their private affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Examples include:
    *   The widespread interest in leaked MMS videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
    *   The popularity of daily vlogs that show mundane personal activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, with some YouTubers exploiting family moments (e.g., a child crying or getting hurt) for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   The enjoyment of CCTV footage showing crimes or accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, often played by media houses on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
    *   Reality shows like *Bigg Boss* heavily exploit this by providing 24/7 live feeds from numerous cameras, allowing audiences to intrude on contestants' personal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Contestants are even encouraged to share personal secrets on national television for TRP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Impact of Such Media Consumption

Psychiatrist Dr. Marcia Sirota claims that just as junk food harms physical health, consuming "bad reality TV shows" can negatively affect the brain, making viewers ruder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Psychologist Brian Gibson's study concluded that watching such reality TV shows increases aggression in viewers, potentially more than violent media or crime TV shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

Furthermore, reality TV promotes a perception that fame and money can be achieved through cheap means, such as abusing people, acting strangely, or being self-serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. This can encourage audiences to believe that insulting, bullying, and broadcasting private lives are valid paths to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

The speaker advises viewers to choose their content wisely, not treating their brains like dustbins, and to consider the impact of entertainment on their mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

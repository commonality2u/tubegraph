## [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | Qualities and Principles of Lord Ram]]
Lord Ram is revered for his exemplary qualities and principles, which are considered universally applicable regardless of one's religious background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. He is seen as a great model of masculinity, embodying strength and fitness while also being humble and compassionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. A common saying emphasizes this: "Ram's name is greater than Ram," suggesting that focusing on his values is more important than his divine status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Applying these values can transform one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

The Dharma associated with Ram emphasizes ethical conduct, as described in Valmiki's Ramayana, where "everyone behaved as per dharma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Key characteristics of Dharma include patience, forgiveness, restraint, non-stealing, cleanliness, control of senses, increasing intelligence, gaining knowledge, practicing truth, and remaining calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. The Mahabharata reiterates "Ahimsa Parmodharam" (non-violence is the utmost duty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, and Tulsidas in Ramcharitmanas states, "Parhitsaris Dharm Nahi Bhai, Parh Pida Sam Nahi Adhmai" (nothing is more important than helping others, and nothing is worse than harming others) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Valmiki Ramayana also states that Truth is the ultimate Dharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

## Misuse of Ram's Name
Despite its noble associations, the name of Ram is perceived to be "in danger" and "dragged through the mud" by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Critics highlight a disturbing trend where individuals use Ram's name and slogans like "Jai Shri Ram" to promote negative actions and hatred in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

This misuse includes:
*   **Promoting wrong things**: Such as bullying and abusing women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Forcing slogans**: There are reports of people being forced to chant "Jai Shri Ram," with incidents occurring across various states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi, Assam, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal, Bihar, Hyderabad, and Telangana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Violence and Lynching**: People have been reportedly killed, burned alive, and lynched in the name of Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Hijacking by followers of Nathuram Godse**: It is claimed that the followers of Nathuram Godse are attempting to "hijack Ram," despite Mahatma Gandhi being a great Ram devotee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Hate speech and support for criminals**: Some groups allegedly use Ram's name to raise slogans of genocide, honor rapists, support lynching accused in Mahapanchayats, and create apps to auction women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

There is a parallel drawn with extremist elements in other religions who use sacred slogans (like "Allahu Akbar") as war cries during violent acts, contrasting them with the original peaceful meaning of the phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Similarly, "Jai Shri Ram" is intended to bring peace but is now associated with violent mobs carrying weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

## Protecting Ram from Nathuram
To counter this perceived misuse, there is a call for "wise Hindus to unite and raise our voices" against those who spread hatred using Ram's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. The emphasis is on saving Ram from "Nathuram," symbolizing the ideological battle between the true spirit of Ram's teachings and the extremist ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

To avoid being misled by religious pretense, individuals are encouraged to read religious scriptures themselves, such as Valmiki's Ramayana, to understand the true values and principles taught within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

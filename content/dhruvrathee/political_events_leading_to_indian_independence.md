By 1946, the Indian subcontinent was in a state of turmoil, with the impending [[british_departure_from_india | British departure]] from India being clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The primary question was no longer about whether India would be free, but *when* and *how* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Reasons for Impending Independence
Several major factors contributed to the urgent shift towards independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:
*   **Quit India Movement (1942)**: Millions of Indians, led by Gandhi, raised their voices against the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Indian National Army (INA) and Red Fort Trials (1944-45)**: Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's struggle and the subsequent trials significantly shocked the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Royal Navy Mutiny (1946)**: Indian soldiers of the British Navy revolted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Second World War Aftermath**: The war led to heavy unemployment, economic recession, and an uncertain British economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

In 1945, Clement Attlee became the new Prime Minister in the UK, and his party's manifesto promised to grant India its freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The majority of the British public also favoured freeing India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Discussions then focused on the execution of this transfer of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### "Freedom at Midnight"
The events of the last year of British occupation are detailed in the book "Freedom at Midnight" by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins, based on thousands of original sources, documents, and Mountbatten's letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This book was recently adapted into a web series directed by Nikhil Advani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Political Landscape in 1946

### Provinces and Elections
In January 1946, the Indian subcontinent was divided into British India provinces (yellow) and princely states (pink) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. There were 17 provinces, 11 of which had already held elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This was due to the Government of India Act of 1935, which granted significant autonomy to provinces and introduced elected legislators and Indian ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. While the British Governor-General retained powers over defence, foreign relations, and veto rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, Indians gained the freedom to elect their own politicians with some power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### 1937 Provincial Elections
The first provincial elections were held in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Key political parties included Congress, Muslim League, and Sikandar Hayat Khan's Unionist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Around 30 million Indians voted, though voting rights were restricted to property or land owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Congress** won in 7 out of 11 provinces: Bombay, Madras, Central Provinces, United Provinces, North West Frontier Provinces, Bihar, and Odisha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Coalition governments** formed in Punjab (Unionist Party), Assam (Assam Valley Party), and Bengal (Krishak Praja Party supported by Muslim League) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Sindh had no single winner, leading to a coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s Muslim League faced losses, winning only 22% of the seats reserved for Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### 1946 Provincial Elections
The next provincial elections were delayed until 1946 due to World War II and Congress's protests during the Quit India Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. By this time, the [[impact_of_communal_tensions_on_indian_independence_process | communal divide]] between Hindus and Muslims was significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Politicians like [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] used provocative speeches to incite fear among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

> "One India is impossible, I realised. It will inevitably mean, that the Muslim would be transferred from the domination of the British to the caste Hindu rule." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>

As a result of this intensified [[religious_and_castebased_tensions_in_India | religious and caste-based tension]]:
*   The Muslim League won 2 out of 11 provinces: Bengal and Sindh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Congress won the remaining 9 provinces and formed governments there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   Crucially, the Muslim League won 87% of all reserved Muslim seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   In Punjab, the Muslim League was the single largest party, though a coalition of Congress, Akali Dal, and the Unionist Party formed the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

This outcome meant that [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] suddenly accumulated a lot of political power after 1946, forcing the British to negotiate with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Jinnah's Transformation and Demand for Pakistan
[[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], who had been a member of the Congress Party 26 years prior and advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, began to disagree with Gandhi's civil disobedience approach around 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. He opposed the non-cooperation resolution passed at the 1920 Nagpur session, believing it was not the path to freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] stated he wanted nothing to do with a "pseudo-religious approach" or "inciting mob hysteria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. He was so secular he even opposed Gandhi's Khilafat movement, which aimed to unite Indian Muslims against the British <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

However, feeling neglected by Congress, [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]]'s ambition grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. After giving up politics and practicing law in London in the late 1920s, he returned in the mid-1930s as a "completely different person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. He declared himself the sole spokesperson of Indian Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> and began campaigning for a separate country, Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Cabinet Mission Plan (1946)

In February 1946, the Royal Navy mutiny began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. On March 24, 1946, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee sent the Cabinet Mission, a three-member committee, to India to negotiate independence with Congress and Muslim League leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Their objectives were:
1.  **Re-establish the Viceroy's Executive Council**: Viceroy Wavell proposed that all members except the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief be Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] demanded that only the Muslim League have the right to appoint all Muslim members, viewing himself as the only leader of Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
2.  **Draft a new constitution**: A committee, later known as the Constituent Assembly of India, was formed for this purpose, eventually led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
3.  **Outline India's post-British political and geographical structure**: This was the most important objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

On May 16, 1946, the Cabinet Mission presented its plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. It proposed a "United India" divided into three groups of provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>:
*   **Section A**: Hindu-majority areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Section B**: Muslim-majority areas in the North-West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Section C**: Muslim-majority areas in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
The Central government would have limited power, handling only defence, external affairs, and communications, with other powers distributed among the provincial groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

[[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] accepted this plan as it granted significant autonomy to Muslim-dominated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. However, Congress initially rejected it, wanting a proper United India rather than a "skeleton government" working with [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Nehru's Statement and Direct Action Day
Pandit Nehru, as Congress President, agreed to join the Constituent Assembly, believing that once a government was formed, they could later tweak the Cabinet Mission's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. On July 10, 1946, Nehru stated in a press conference that Congress retained the right to change the plan if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

[[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] interpreted this as Nehru planning to force his ideology, and immediately rejected the Cabinet Mission Plan and refused to work with Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. On July 29, 1946, [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] announced that the Muslim League would begin a struggle, stating that if Muslims were not given a separate nation (Pakistan), they would start "Direct Action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. On July 30, [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] declared August 16, 1946, as "Direct Action Day," warning that India would either be divided or destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

> "If Congress is asking for a war, we won't back down." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>

The epicentre of Direct Action Day was Bengal, where the Muslim League held the most political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, then Chief Minister of Bengal (known as the "Butcher of Bengal"), gave free rein to "orthodox, unemployed, frustrated, brainwashed, and anti-social elements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The police were instructed to support the populist movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   Calcutta became a "city of corpses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, with around 6,000 people killed and 15,000 injured between August 16-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   These riots were just the beginning, with many more occurring before [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | partition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Interim Government
Despite the violence, Viceroy Wavell invited Nehru and Congress to form an interim government on August 6, 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Wavell tried to bridge the gaps between Congress and the Muslim League, advising [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] to cooperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Nehru and [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] met on August 15, 1946, agreeing that communal problems could be solved through mutual discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Nehru offered concessions, including five ministries to the Muslim League, but [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] insisted that only the Muslim League could nominate Muslim candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Congress, a secular party, refused to accept this, as it would imply [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]]'s sole authority over all Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

On August 25, 1946, a declaration from the Viceroy House directed the formation of an interim government, which took office on September 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   Initial appointments included Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Two Muslim members were to be appointed later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   This transitional government was to function until the British completely left India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

Seeing the interim government formed based on Congress's ideologies, [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] became relentless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

> "Rejecting Nehru's offer proved to be a big mistake. We lost all rights to nominate Muslim members. The League's existence is being threatened. We'll play this game. We'll join the interim government." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>

On October 15, 1946, [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] agreed to join the interim government without conditions, nominating Liaquat Ali Khan (who later became Pakistan's first Prime Minister) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. The Muslim League was initially given the Finance Ministry, and later five ministries in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

### Deterioration and Widespread Riots
Despite the formation of a balanced interim government, working together became increasingly difficult for Congress and the Muslim League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. The biggest reason was the unrelenting Hindu-Muslim riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   **Noakhali Riots (October 1946)**: Weeks after the interim government formed, a large-scale riot broke out in Noakhali, Bengal, a Muslim-majority area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Armed mobs looted, set fires, killed people, and forced conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Chief Minister Suhrawardy acknowledged these but took no action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Gandhi's Efforts**: Mahatma Gandhi was deeply saddened and visited Noakhali from November 1946 to February 1947, walking barefoot through 47 villages to promote communal unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. He convinced Hindu and Muslim leaders to live together as guarantors of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. He believed that if people lived in peace, politicians would reflect that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Bihar and United Provinces**: On October 24, 1946, Hindus in Bihar began retaliating for the Noakhali incidents, and similar situations arose in the United Provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

Gandhi gradually realized the strength of [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]]'s hold over a segment of Muslim society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, believing persuasion of [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] was the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

## Mountbatten's Arrival and the Push for Partition

In March 1947, the Muslim League successfully overthrew the coalition government in Punjab, a crucial province for the idea of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Riots erupted in Rawalpindi, forcing Chief Minister Khizr Hayat Tiwana to resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. The Muslim League couldn't form its own government due to other parties' animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. Sikh leader Master Tara Singh's "Down with Pakistan" slogans outside the Punjab Legislative Assembly led to more riots in Lahore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

Frustrated by the ongoing riots exposing his failures, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten as India's last Viceroy on March 22, 1947, tasking him with stopping riots and negotiating with [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] and Nehru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

### Gandhi's Last Effort
Mountbatten, who initially desired a United India, proposed it to [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] but was rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Meanwhile, Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel were fed up with the Muslim League's constant interference in the interim government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, leading them to accept the idea of an independent Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

Mahatma Gandhi, however, was still against [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | partition]] and met Mountbatten on April 1, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

> "Please, Lord Louis, don't do it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>

Desperate to prevent [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | partition]], Gandhi proposed making [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] the Prime Minister of a united India, willing for 300 million Hindus to be governed by him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. Mountbatten agreed on the condition that Gandhi convince Congress first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

> "Jawahar and Sardar are like my sons. At my word, they will do or die." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>

However, Nehru and Sardar Patel, having worked with the Muslim League in the interim government, refused this proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

> "I followed you all my life, forgive me, for I can't anymore. The sacrifices of so many cannot, and will not be forgotten in the face of the ambition of one man!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>

This refusal was a painful and shocking moment for Gandhi, as Nehru and Patel had always obeyed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

## Partition Plans and Independence

### Dickie Bird Plan
With everyone else agreeing to [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | partition]], Mountbatten prepared a new plan, the "Dickie Bird Plan," passed by the British Cabinet on May 2, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. This plan controversially gave every province the option to join India or Pakistan, or to remain independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. This "three-nation theory" was even approved by [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   Pandit Nehru was furious, stating the plan aimed at India's "disintegration" and would "break India into small pieces" leading to "Balkanisation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

### VP Menon's Plan
Shocked by Nehru's reaction, Mountbatten immediately asked political commission V.P. Menon to prepare a new [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | partition]] plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. Menon completed this task in just six hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
*   Menon advised transferring power to two independent British Dominions: India and Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   Provinces would be divided based on their elected representatives, with Bengal and Punjab divided into two parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]] initially rejected this plan, requesting a referendum in the Northwest Frontier Province and Baluchistan, which Menon accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.
*   Mountbatten refused any dominion status for the Princely States, advising them to choose either India or Pakistan based on geographical contiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. By August 1947, any autonomy for princely states was merely symbolical, as they had to depend on the central government for defence, foreign affairs, and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

### 3rd June Plan and Independence
On June 3, 1947, this new plan was finally put forward and accepted by all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. Pandit Nehru, Sardar Patel, J.B. Kripalani, Baldev Singh, [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | Jinnah]], Liaquat Ali Khan, and Abdur Rab Nishtar collectively endorsed it at a conference table with Mountbatten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. No one was completely happy, and everyone had to compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

On August 15, 1947, at midnight, Pandit Nehru hoisted the Indian flag, and India gained its freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

### Aftermath of Partition
The [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_Jinnah | partition]] that followed was devastating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>:
*   Approximately 15 million people migrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   Over 1 million people were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   Forced religious conversions occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   More than 75,000 women were kidnapped and raped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

This period also saw Sardar Patel working tirelessly to unite the princely states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
The freedom obtained in 1947 was initially a dominion status; complete freedom as an independent republic came only in 1950 with the implementation of the constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

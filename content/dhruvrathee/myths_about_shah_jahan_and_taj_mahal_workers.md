The [[history_of_the_taj_mahal | Taj Mahal]] is a monument shrouded in mystery and various theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While some claims suggest hidden Hindu idols or fabled good days behind its [[debate_over_22_closed_doors_of_the_taj_mahal | 22 closed doors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, another persistent myth surrounds the fate of the workers who constructed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Myth of Mutilated Workers

One popular theory about the Taj Mahal is that Mughal emperor Shah Jahan ordered the hands of 20,000 labourers to be chopped off after its completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The stated reason for this gruesome act was to prevent these skilled workers from ever building another monument as beautiful as the Taj Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This claim has been repeated by various figures, including Union Agricultural Minister Narendra Singh Tomar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### Logical Inconsistencies

Upon logical examination, this claim appears highly improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. It raises questions about the logistics of such an operation:
*   How could 20,000 workers have their hands chopped off on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>?
*   Would workers queue up for their turn to be mutilated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>?
*   It's unlikely that workers would calmly wait if such an event began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

### Lack of Historical and Archaeological Evidence

There is zero historical evidence to support this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>:
*   No archaeological findings, such as skeletal remains of hands, have ever been discovered to corroborate the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   Neither court historians nor foreign travelers of that era mentioned such an event in their extensive records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

### Contrary Evidence

Historical evidence actually refutes this myth:
*   Shah Jahan established a large settlement called Taj Ganj, which still exists today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This settlement was where thousands of masons, artisans, and workers from across the empire gathered to work on the Taj Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   The descendants of these workers continue to live and practice their ancestral skills in Taj Ganj today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   After the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan's workers went on to build an entirely new city, Shahjahanabad (later known as Delhi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   Major monuments like the Red Fort and Jama Masjid were constructed around the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. If the workers' hands had been chopped off, it would have been impossible for the empire to construct such vast projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   Shah Jahan's reign is considered the Golden Period of Mughal Architecture, a feat possible only because he respected his workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

### Origin of the Myth

This specific myth, along with other [[controversies_about_taj_mahal_being_a_hindu_temple | controversies about the Taj Mahal being a Hindu Temple]] and the Tejo Mahalaya claim, became widespread through channels like "WhatsApp University" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The fictional tales of [[influence_of_pn_oak_on_taj_mahal_conspiracy_theories | Purushottam Nagesh Oak]] are often forwarded repeatedly, leading people to believe them as true accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Taj Mahal stands as an architectural marvel, recognized as one of the official Seven Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. It is a source of national pride and a significant tourist attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The myth about Shah Jahan mutilating his workers is unsubstantiated by historical facts and is disproven by contemporary evidence of continued construction and worker settlements during his reign.

Stories about the Yeti are thousands of years old, with some even predating the Pre-Buddhist era and passed down for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In the Himalayas, some societies and religions traditionally worshipped this "Glacier Being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Ancient Origins and Legends

The term "Yeti" originates from the Tibetan language, specifically from the Sherpa words "Yeh + Teh," meaning "cliff-dwelling bear" or "a bear that lives among the rocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

A 12th-century Tibetan religious text called Mani Kabum discusses a connection between humans and Yetis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. It includes a mythological story where a Bodhisattva monkey, sent by God to meditate in Tibet, was encountered by a rock-ogress named Sinmo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The ogress, an incarnation of a Buddhist deity, proposed marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. After initial refusal, the monkey married her to prevent her from marrying a demon and giving birth to monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. They had six monkey-human children, whose lineage evolved over generations into humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. According to this story, Yetis represent one of the earlier generations that did not fully evolve into humans, suggesting shared ancestry between humans and Yetis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Historically, the fame of Yeti stories was such that when Alexander the Great conquered parts of India in 326 BC, he asked to see a Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Locals declined, stating that Yetis could only survive in high mountains and could not be brought to lower altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Modern Sightings and Terminology

The first recorded modern sighting of a creature resembling a Yeti was in 1832 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. British naturalist Brian Hodgson wrote in the Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal about encountering a giant non-human creature covered in long black fur that ran away upon discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Hodgson referred to it as an "orangutan," though orangutans are not native to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

In 1889, British Army Physician Major LA Waddell reported seeing footprints on Himalayan glaciers that appeared to be from a hominid species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The term "Abominable Snowman" was coined in 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. After a Mount Everest expedition, climber Charles Howard-Bury and his team told an English newspaper journalist they had seen huge footprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Local guides identified the footprints as those of "Metoh Kangmi," meaning "Man-Bear Snow-Man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The journalist wrongly translated "Metoh" as "Filthy," which was later changed to "Abominable" in the published article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

By 1937, seven expeditions had encountered such footprints, and two claimed to have seen a Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Descriptions and Beliefs

Those who claim to have seen a Yeti describe it as:
*   A large, ape-like creature, bigger than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   Having long arms, a strong chest and abdomen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   Standing 7-8 feet tall and weighing around 90-180 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   Its body, except for its face, is covered with long reddish-brown or grey-black fur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   It cannot twist its body or look back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   It walks upright on two legs and uses its hands and legs to swing between trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   It is said to carry a large stone as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   Yetis are usually seen alone or in pairs, rarely in groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   They communicate by whistling and emit a terrible smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   They may smile or make strange sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   They are seen as harbingers of bad times and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   Yetis are believed to live in high snowy areas of the Himalayan mountains, especially in Nepal and Tibet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Cultural Impact and Regulations

In their reports, local hunters, guides, and Sherpas claimed that Tibetan monasteries possessed Yeti hands and skulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. An expedition by the British newspaper Daily Mail in 1953 visited the Pangboche Monastery, which locals claimed housed a Yeti skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. They took a hair sample from the alleged skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

In 1959, due to the increasing public fascination and expeditions, the US and Nepali governments collaborated to establish regulations concerning the Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. These regulations included:
*   A Royalty Fee of 5000 Indian Rupees for a permit to search for Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   A ban on hunting Yeti, though killing in self-defense was excusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   Any captured live Yeti had to be surrendered to the Nepali government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   All reports related to Yeti's existence had to be submitted to the Nepali government first, and their permission was required before releasing information to the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

A significant reason for these regulations was the belief by both the Nepali and American governments that the Yeti "could be real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

## Notable Explorers and Evolving Beliefs

Peter Byrne, an Irish American explorer, undertook five expeditions searching for Yeti, spending 38 months in the Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. He visited the Pangboche Buddhist Monastery, which claimed to possess Yeti remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Though initially refused, he obtained a finger from the alleged "Yeti's hand" for research, after making a donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This finger was smuggled to London with the help of actor James Stewart and later analyzed by Professor William Osman Hill, who determined it was human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

Legendary Italian climber Reinhold Messner initially denied Yeti's existence in his books before 1986, calling it "nonsensical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. However, in 1986, while following an old Tibetan path, he encountered a "big and dark creature" that stood upright, ran faster than humans, and jumped between trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. This encounter, where the creature was only 10 steps away, led Messner to become obsessed with the Yeti and spend 12 years researching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. His eventual conclusion was that Yetis do not exist as human-like abominable snowmen, but are instead a [[comparisons_between_yeti_myths_and_real_animal_discoveries | Himalayan brown bear]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

Zoologist Ernst Schafer, during a secret Nazi Party mission to Tibet in 1939, also concluded that Yeti does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. He believed the creature assumed to be Yeti by locals was a Tibetan bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Edmund Hillary, the first person to climb Mount Everest, also concluded after months of searching that the Yeti is "just a myth, born out of people's superstitions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

## Societal and Cultural Shaping of Belief

The belief in supernatural and mythological beings like the Yeti is often shaped by society and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. People adopt such beliefs from childhood stories, reinforced by their communities, making it difficult to refute them later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. The mystery of the Yeti also offers a fascination, representing an idea of escaping modern society and living freely with nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

Some theories suggest that the Yeti legend might be based on observations of real, large primates from the past. The Gigantopithecus, a 10-foot-tall ape weighing 200-300 kg and covered in thick fur, lived from 2 million to 200,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Fossils of this animal have been found near the Himalayan mountains, leading to speculation that ancient humans in the region may have seen and interacted with these creatures, passing down stories that evolved into the Yeti folklore in Tibet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

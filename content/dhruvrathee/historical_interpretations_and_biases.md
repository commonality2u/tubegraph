During the 2024 elections, politicians have engaged in campaigning that sometimes focuses on figures like Aurangzeb and the Mughals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Prime Minister Modi, for instance, stated that "Congress does not remember Aurangzeb's atrocities, he who destroyed hundreds of Hindu temples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Such statements are described not as mistakes, but as intentional talking points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Historical Narratives and Disputed Interpretations

A significant aspect of historical [[archaeological_evidence_and_historical_interpretations_of_pyramids | interpretations]] involves challenging prevailing narratives, often leading to controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. For example, historian Romila Thapar faces intense criticism because she claims that Hindus were not slaves, but free people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This assertion goes against a narrative propagated by some, which aims to make people feel that their ancestors were enslaved by Muslims for thousands of years, painting Hindus as victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

The concept of "Double Think," from George Orwell's novel *1984*, describes the ability of blind supporters to accept two contradicting ideas simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This is observed in those who, for instance, believe both that Hindus were oppressed for thousands of years and that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was a great emperor under whom Hindus were free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj: A Secular Ruler

Contrary to narratives that portray historical conflicts solely along religious lines, historical facts reveal a more complex picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a Hindu, respected Muslims, as evidenced by his grandfather respecting both Hindu and Muslim saints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Shivaji often visited Sufi saint Yakut Baba for blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

His policies promoted religious freedom, as stated in an order from November 2, 1669: "everybody is free to follow his religion, and nobody is allowed to disturb it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Historian Khafi Khan noted Shivaji's strict rule forbidding his soldiers from harming women, the Qur'an, or mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. When a Muslim governor's daughter-in-law was captured, Shivaji apologized to her and sent her back respectfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Shivaji's army included many Muslims, including Muslim generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Notable Muslim figures in his service included Noor Khan Beg (infantry chief) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, Shama Khan (lieutenant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, Daulat Khan and Darya Sarang (navy chiefs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, Siddi Hilal and Ibrahim Khan (artillery commanders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, and Maulana Haider Ali (secretary of intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. In a notable encounter, Shivaji used an iron claw on the advice of his Muslim bodyguard, while his opponent, Afzal Khan, had a Hindu Brahmin advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Aurangzeb: A Nuanced Rule

Aurangzeb, often portrayed as a Muslim fanatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, also had Hindus in his army and administration. Mirza Raja Jai Singh, a Hindu Rajput, led Aurangzeb's army in the Battle of Purandar against Shivaji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Aurangzeb's chief diwan was Raja Raghunath Ray, a Hindu, whom Aurangzeb regarded as his greatest administrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Hindu participation in elite Mughal administration increased by 50% under his rule, with 31.6% of Mughal nobility being Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. He had 72 Rajput and 96 Maratha mansabdars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

However, Aurangzeb's rule was not entirely secular. He did demolish Hindu temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The policy of coexistence from Akbar's rule was phased out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. In 1665, he increased customs duty on Hindu traders to double that paid by Muslims, and two years later, abolished customs duty for Muslims entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Orders for demolishing Hindu temples to establish Islam are also documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Historians Irfan Habib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> and Audrey Truschke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, both criticized by some groups, acknowledge Aurangzeb's targeting of important temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

Paradoxically, Aurangzeb also issued orders and made gestures of tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. In 1654, he advised Rana Raj Singh to ensure that subjects of every religion live in peace and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. After declaring himself emperor in 1658, he ordered officials in Banaras not to harm Brahmins or Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. He also ordered the construction of homes for pious Brahmins and holy fakirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> and participated in religious discussions with Hindu saints, showering them with gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. He granted tax-free land and villages to support Hindu temples in Chitrakoot, Allahabad, Vrindavan, and Bihar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a> and extended similar policies to Jains in Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

> [!info] The seeming contradiction of Aurangzeb's actions—destroying some temples while supporting others—reflects a complex political strategy rather than a clear communal or secular stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Modern Parallels and Political Biases

Eminent historian Harbans Mukhia draws a parallel between Narendra Modi and Aurangzeb, citing similarities like their birth in Gujarat and their projection of themselves as holy persons (Modi as a fakir, Aurangzeb by transcribing the Qur'an and stitching caps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Both are described as power-hungry, shifting between communal and secular stances depending on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

> [!example] Examples of [[Accusations of political affiliations and bias | fluctuating rhetoric]]:
> *   **Secular Modi:** Praising Islam for peace, envisioning Muslim youth with the Qur'an and a computer, helping conserve a mosque in Maldives, advising against anti-Muslim remarks, spreading cheer on Eid, and reminding of Hazrat Imam Hussain's sacrifice on Muharram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
> *   **Communal Modi:** Identifying protestors "by their clothes" during CAA-NRC protests, alleged hate speeches by BJP politicians, lynchings, welcoming convicts of the Bilkis Bano case with flowers, and using "Mughal mindset" accusations against the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

The widespread circulation of messages promoting hatred against Muslims on platforms like WhatsApp is seen as part of a "brainwashing mafia's" agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This propaganda aims to create a divide and convince people to hate Muslims, projecting Hindus as being "in danger" to secure votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

## Distorting History for Political Gain

Historical figures like Akbar and Maharana Pratap are sometimes portrayed in a Hindu-Muslim rivalry to reinforce a narrative of constant religious conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. However, historical evidence shows Muslim warriors like Afghani Pathan Hakim Khan Sur fighting alongside Maharana Pratap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, and Akbar had Hindu generals like Raja Man Singh and many Rajput soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

The Vishwanath temple, demolished by one Mughal emperor (Aurangzeb), was built during the reign of another (Akbar) under Raja Man Singh's supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Akbar practiced "Sulh-i-Kul" (Peace For All) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, and four of his "Nine Gems" were Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. The [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramcharitmanas]] was written, and Ram Leela began during Akbar's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Hindu epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata were translated into Persian during his reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh translated 52 Upanishads and the Bhagavad Geeta into Persian, believing the Upanishads to be humanity's first monotheistic text mentioned in the Qur'an <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. His efforts helped in the global study of Indian religious texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

Other secular Muslim rulers include Bahadur Shah Zafar, who celebrated Hindu festivals like Dussehra and Diwali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a> and united with Hindu and Muslim leaders against the British in 1857 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. Wajid Ali Shah introduced 'Adaab' as a secular salutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>, and Kashmir's Zainul Abidin abolished the Jizya tax and prohibited cow slaughter to respect Hindu sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## Contemporary Implications

The history of common Hindu and Muslim masses living together cordially, known as Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb, counters the narrative of constant Hindu-Muslim rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Despite instances of communal violence, Hindus and Muslims have largely shared historical experiences together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

Politicians are accused of using "Divide-and-Rule" tactics, circulating propaganda through WhatsApp and pro-government media to incite hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. This includes claiming that India only achieved "real freedom" after 2014, implying that Hindus were "downtrodden" for thousands of years and lacked confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. This narrative disrespects historical figures like Krishnadevaraya, Maharana Pratap, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and Hindu saints like Tulsidas and Swami Vivekananda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>, who championed tolerance and universal acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

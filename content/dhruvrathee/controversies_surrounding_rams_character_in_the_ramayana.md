From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

Concerns and allegations have been raised regarding certain aspects of Lord Ram's character as depicted in the Ramayana, particularly concerning events not present in the original Valmiki text. Two prominent allegations often brought against Lord Ram include his decision to leave his pregnant wife, Sita, and the killing of Shambuk, a Shudra, for meditating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These points were notably mentioned by Dr. Ambedkar in his booklet, *Riddles of Ram and Krishna* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## [[misinterpretations_and_later_additions_to_the_ramayana | The Addition of Uttar Kand]]

A core argument suggests that these controversial events are not part of the original Valmiki Ramayana but were later additions found in the [[the_addition_of_uttar_kand_to_the_original_ramayana | Uttar Kand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Evidence Against Uttar Kand's Originality

The Valmiki Ramayana, specifically Chapter 128 of its sixth section, the Yuddha Kand, concludes the main narrative with what is described as a "happily ever after" ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This section details Ram's coronation, the return of allies, and the peaceful, prosperous state of his kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. During Ram's reign, people lived for thousands of years without disease or sorrow, trees bore fruit regularly, and clouds rained on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Furthermore, it explicitly states that old people did not have to perform last rites for young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. All sections of society (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra) were content and ethical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The text also includes a Phalashruti section (Chapter 125), which outlines the benefits of listening to the scripture, explicitly stating, "This foremost lyric... as written at first by Valmiki," suggesting the completeness of the work at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Contradictions Within Uttar Kand

The Uttar Kand contains elements that contradict the primary narrative of Valmiki's Ramayana:

*   **Shambuk's Story vs. Ram Rajya:** The [[misinterpretations_and_later_additions_to_the_ramayana | Shambuk's story]] in the Uttar Kand, where a Brahmin's son dies prematurely leading to Shambuk's killing, directly contradicts the description of Ram Rajya where no old person had to perform funeral rites for a young person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Pushpak Viman:** In Valmiki's Ramayana (Yuddha Kand Chapter 127), Ram sends the Pushpak Viman back to Kuber after returning to Ayodhya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. However, the Uttar Kand depicts Ram using the Pushpak Viman to search for Shambuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Treatment of Messengers:** Uttar Kand (Chapter 13) describes [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] killing Kuber's messenger and demons eating his body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This contradicts Vibhishan's advice to Ravan in Sundarkand (Chapter 52, Shloka 15), where he lists acceptable punishments for messengers but explicitly states that killing a messenger is unheard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

These inconsistencies suggest that the Uttar Kand was a later addition, "forcefully" continuing the "happily ever after" ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Purpose of the Uttar Kand's Addition

While historical evidence is not solid, it is speculated that the [[the_addition_of_uttar_kand_to_the_original_ramayana | Uttar Kand]] was added to promote Brahmanical superiority and casteism, aiming to prove Brahmins were superior to Shudras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Sita's story within this section also appears to be an attempt to promote patriarchy, asserting male power and control over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. It is suggested that "casteist and sexist people" added this continuation to serve their agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## [[metaphorical_and_literal_interpretations_of_the_ramayana | Interpretations of the Ramayana]]

The Ramayana is a religious scripture, historically estimated to have been written between the 7th and 4th century BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Whether the events described literally happened is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Many believe it to be a [[metaphorical_and_literal_interpretations_of_the_ramayana | metaphorical epic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

For instance, the idea of Lord Hanuman picking up a mountain and flying across the sea is not physically possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. However, this could be a metaphor for immense effort or strength, similar to saying someone is "carrying a mountain on their shoulders" to describe hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Another literary device, *Atishayokti Alankar* (exaggeration), may have been used to make narratives more entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This is seen in historical accounts, such as the film *300* exaggerating the numbers in the Battle of Thermopylae, or the exaggerated weight of Maharana Pratap's armor and weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

Similarly, other mythological stories, such as Jesus Christ turning water into wine, Prophet Muhammad splitting the moon, or Lord Hanuman swallowing the sun, are seen as mythological, not scientific or historical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. They are believed to contain deeper metaphorical meanings, like controlling one's senses or overcoming nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Modern Misuse of Ram's Name

Despite the potential for deep philosophical and ethical lessons, the name of Ram is often misused in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The slogan "Jai Shri Ram" has been associated with bullying, abuse, and violence, particularly by individuals described as "degenerates dressed in saffron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

There are reports from across India of people being forced to say "Jai Shri Ram" and even being killed, burnt alive, or lynched in Ram's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the ethical [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | qualities]] of Ram, such as patience, forgiveness, non-stealing, cleanliness, and truthfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Religious texts emphasize non-violence ("Ahimsa Parmodharam") and helping others ("Parhitsaris Dharm Nahi Bhai") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

The misuse of Ram's name by followers of Nathuram Godse, who are seen as trying to "hijack Ram," is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. It is argued that such actions tarnish the true spirit and [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | principles of Lord Ram]], who represents [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | qualities]] of masculinity like strength, humility, and compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This has led to the call to "save Ram from Nathuram" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Ultimately, Lord Ram is considered great due to his [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | qualities]] and the values he promoted, making him a figure for everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

The RMS Titanic, celebrated as the world's largest and most luxurious ship of its time, embarked on its ill-fated maiden voyage on April 10, 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its journey commenced from Southampton, England, destined for New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Onboard were a diverse group of individuals, including renowned industrialists, actors, and immigrants seeking a better life in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The ship was under the command of 62-year-old Senior Captain Edward John Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. There was considerable excitement surrounding the ship among passengers, the public, and the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Dimensions and Cost
The Titanic measured approximately 269 meters in length and over 53 meters high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Its construction cost 7.5 million dollars at the time, which, when adjusted for inflation, is equivalent to 400 million dollars today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Unparalleled Luxury and Amenities
The luxury of the Titanic was awe-inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, with its facilities and decorations surpassing even a five-star hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Features included:
*   Stained glass mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   Ornate wood paneling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   Two grand staircases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   A heated swimming pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   A Turkish bath and an electric bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   A gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   A squash court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Four restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Two barber shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   A library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

## "Unsinkable" Design Features
The White Star Line, the company that built the Titanic, designed it with safety features that led many to believe it was "unsinkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The Vice President of the company even publicly asserted its unsinkable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Two main features contributed to this belief:
1.  **Double Bottom Hull**: The ship's main body, known as the hull, featured two layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This design meant that if the bottom layer sustained damage, the second layer would safeguard the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
2.  **Water-tight Compartments**: The hull was divided into 16 separate water-tight compartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It was believed that even if four of these compartments filled with water, the ship would remain afloat without issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

However, the impact from the iceberg was on the side of the ship, where only a single layer was present, rendering the double bottom hull ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Furthermore, the collision breached six of the 16 water-tight compartments, exceeding the ship's survivability limit of four compartments and sealing its fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Wreckage Discovery and Deterioration
The wreckage of the Titanic was found more than 70 years after its sinking in September 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. American ocean explorer Robert Ballard and a French oceanographer located it 3,800 meters (3.8 km) under the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The ship was found in two separate pieces, 600 meters apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Decades later, the underwater environment has caused significant erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, with bacteria and other organisms consuming its metal framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. It is anticipated that the ship will completely disintegrate underwater by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

## Legacy and Replicas
Despite over a century passing, fascination with the Titanic endures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. In 2012, Australian billionaire Clive Palmer announced plans to build "Titanic II," an exact replica intended to sail the same route as the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This project, initially slated for completion in 2016, has faced delays into 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, with some suggesting a lack of public interest due to the replica's proposed absence of modern amenities like TV or Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

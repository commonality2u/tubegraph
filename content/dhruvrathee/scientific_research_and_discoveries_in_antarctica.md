Antarctica, the world's coldest and windiest continent, is also the driest place on Earth, considered a desert despite its ice, with only about 51mm of rain annually that turns to snow before hitting the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This extreme environment has historically limited human influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, but it has become a crucial hub for global scientific endeavors.

## Early Expeditions and Discoveries
While the concept of a southern landmass, *Antarctos*, was theorized as early as 350 BC by Greek philosophers like Aristotle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, actual human landings occurred much later. The first undisputed landing on Antarctica was in 1895, when a Norwegian ship called the *Antarctic* reached its shores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The first two decades of the 1900s are known as the "Heroic years of Antarctica" due to numerous expeditions, scientific discoveries, and new findings about the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. It was during this period that scientists first discovered plants, specifically mosses, growing on the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## International Collaboration
Following the "Colonial period" (1908-1942) when several countries laid claims to parts of Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, nations began establishing permanent research centers as a political strategy to demonstrate their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

The signing of the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] on December 1, 1959, marked a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Key points of the treaty included:
*   Antarctica would be used for peaceful purposes only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Everyone would be free to carry out scientific investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Results of scientific observations would be freely exchanged and available to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

This treaty, initially signed by 12 governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, fostered an environment of scientific research over geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The International Council of Scientific Unions established a Special Committee for Antarctic research, leading to strong collaboration among scientists from different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Annually, approximately 4,500 scientists travel to Antarctica for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India's Contributions]]
[[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]], initially opposed to the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]], launched its first expedition in December 1981, led by marine biologist Dr. Syed Zahoor Qasim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Although conducted secretly and technically illegal at the time since India was not part of the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, it was a research expedition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]] later signed the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Today, [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]] maintains two active stations in Antarctica for continuous geological studies and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. A notable scientific contribution came from Sudipta Sengupta, who, during [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India's]] second expedition, studied the Schirmacher Hills on Antarctica's coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Her research revealed that these hills were part of a fault line once connected to the Indian subcontinent, from which [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]] broke away and moved north to collide with Tibet, forming the Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Resource Exploration and Environmental Concerns
In 1991, the [[environmental_protection_and_mining_ban_in_antarctica | Environmental Protection Treaty]], also known as the Madrid Protocol, was signed, imposing restrictions on drilling and mining activities in Antarctica to protect the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

Despite the ban, significant natural resources are believed to exist:
*   A 1992 study by US Geological Survey experts estimated 19 billion barrels of recoverable oil under Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   Russian mineral explorers claim there are 500 billion barrels of oil and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Currently, the Madrid Protocol and the high cost of extraction prevent oil mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. However, the melting ice due to climate change is making Antarctica more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, and future technological advancements could make extraction economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. The [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] is set to expire in 2048, raising questions about the future of these regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

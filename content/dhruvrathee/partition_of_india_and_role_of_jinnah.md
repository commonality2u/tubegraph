The period leading up to India's independence was marked by a "riveting political game of thrones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. In 1946, the entire nation was in turmoil, and while the British departure was certain, the question of *how* and *when* India would gain freedom remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This final year of British occupancy, from January 1946 to August 1947, was a crucial and complex phase in [[political_events_leading_to_indian_independence | Indian Independence]].

### Factors Leading to British Departure

Several key factors contributed to the British decision to leave India:
*   **Quit India Movement (1942)**: Millions of Indians protested against the British government under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Indian National Army (INA)**: Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's INA struggle (1944-45) and the subsequent Red Fort Trials delivered a significant blow to British morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Royal Navy Mutiny**: Indian soldiers in the British Navy revolted, further undermining British authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Second World War Impact**: The war led to heavy unemployment, economic recession, and an uncertain economic future for Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **British Political Shift**: After the 1945 elections, Clement Attlee became the new Prime Minister in the UK, and his Labour Party had promised to return India's freedom in its manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

By this time, a majority of the British people were also in favor of freeing India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Political Landscape and the Rise of Jinnah

The Government of India Act of 1935 had introduced elected legislators and Indian ministers, granting provinces significant autonomy, though crucial powers like defense and foreign relations remained with the British Governor General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The **1937 provincial elections** saw the Congress Party win in 7 out of 11 provinces. The Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, performed poorly, winning only 22% of the seats reserved for Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

However, the **1946 provincial elections**, delayed by World War II and the Quit India Movement, presented a starkly different picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. By then, the [[communalism_versus_secularism_in_indian_history | communal divide]] between Hindus and Muslims had become significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Jinnah's use of provocative speeches, instilling fear of "caste Hindu rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, played a crucial role. In these elections, the Muslim League won 2 of the 11 provinces (Bengal and Sindh) and secured 87% of all reserved Muslim seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. They were also the single largest party in Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

This outcome dramatically increased Jinnah's political power, forcing the British to negotiate with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Jinnah's primary demand was for a separate nation, Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

#### Jinnah's Evolution from Secularist to Separatist
Interestingly, Jinnah had once been a member of the Congress Party, advocating for Hindus and Muslims to live together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. In 1915, he welcomed Mahatma Gandhi to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. His family, Bhatia Rajput by origin, converted to Islam after being excommunicated by orthodox Hindus for their fishing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Disagreements began in 1920 when Jinnah disapproved of Gandhi's civil disobedience and opposed the non-cooperation resolution, calling it the "wrong path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. He famously stated he had "nothing to do with this pseudo-religious approach" and did not believe in "inciting mob hysteria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Jinnah was so secular that he even opposed Gandhi's Khilafat movement, which aimed to unite Indian Muslims against the British <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

However, feeling neglected by Congress, his ambition grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. After a period in London practicing law, Jinnah returned to India in the mid-1930s as a "completely different person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. He declared himself "the sole spokesperson of Muslims in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> and began campaigning for a new country, Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### The Cabinet Mission Plan (1946)

In March 1946, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee sent the Cabinet Mission to India to negotiate independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Their three main objectives were:
1.  **Re-establish the Viceroy's Executive Council**: Viceroy Wavell proposed an Indian-majority council, but Jinnah demanded that only the Muslim League have the right to appoint Muslim members, seeing himself as the "only leader of Muslims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
2.  **Draft a new constitution**: A Constituent Assembly was formed for this purpose, later led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
3.  **Framework for post-British India**: This was the most crucial objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

On May 16, 1946, the Cabinet Mission presented its plan: a "United India" divided into three groups of provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>:
*   Section A: Hindu majority areas.
*   Section B: Muslim majority areas in the North-West.
*   Section C: Muslim majority areas in the East.

The proposal envisioned a weak central government handling only defense, external affairs, and communications, with other powers distributed among these provincial groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. As this plan offered significant autonomy to Muslim-dominated areas, Jinnah initially accepted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

However, Congress initially rejected the plan, advocating for a truly united India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Pandit Nehru, then Congress President, agreed to join the Constituent Assembly but stated publicly that Congress retained the right to change the Cabinet Mission Plan if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Jinnah perceived this as Nehru's attempt to impose his ideology, immediately rejecting the plan and refusing to work with Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Direct Action Day and Escalating Violence

On July 29, 1946, Jinnah announced that the Muslim League was preparing for a "struggle," warning that if Muslims were not given a separate nation, Pakistan, they would initiate "Direct Action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. He declared August 16, 1946, as "Direct Action Day," stating, "India would either be divided or destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

The epicenter of Direct Action Day was Bengal, where the Muslim League, led by Chief Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (dubbed the "Butcher of Bengal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>), held significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Suhrawardy reportedly gave "free rein to the orthodox, unemployed, frustrated, brainwashed, and anti-social elements on the streets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Calcutta became a "city of corpses," with around 6,000 killed and 15,000 injured between August 16-19, 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This incident marked the beginning of many more riots before the partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Formation of the Interim Government

Despite the violence, Viceroy Wavell invited Nehru and Congress to form an interim government on August 6, 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Although Jinnah and Nehru met and agreed on mutual discussions to solve communal problems, Jinnah's condition that only the Muslim League nominate Muslim candidates for the interim government was unacceptable to Congress, a secular party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

On August 25, 1946, the formation of an interim government, predominantly composed of Congress leaders, was declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Initially, Jinnah was relentless in his opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, but realizing the League's existence was threatened, he agreed to join on October 15, 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Jinnah himself did not join, nominating Liaquat Ali Khan (who later became Pakistan's first Prime Minister) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The Muslim League was given five ministries, including Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### Deterioration of Relations and Gandhi's Efforts

Despite the formation of the interim government, Hindu-Muslim riots continued to rage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Weeks after the interim government was formed, large-scale riots erupted in Noakhali, Bengal, a Muslim majority area where tensions had simmered due to economic grievances against Hindu moneylenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The riots, which included forced conversions, were acknowledged by Chief Minister Suhrawardy, who took no action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

Mahatma Gandhi was deeply saddened and spent from November 1946 to February 1947 walking barefoot through Noakhali's 47 villages, covering 180 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. His efforts focused on promoting [[communalism_versus_secularism_in_indian_history | communal unity]], encouraging Hindu and Muslim leaders to live together and become guarantors of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Gandhi believed that if people lived in peace, partition would not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. He aimed for "unity in United India with everyone living peacefully together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

However, Nehru saw Gandhi's approach as merely applying "ointment" to symptoms rather than addressing the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. While Gandhi's efforts brought temporary peace to Bengal, the riots spread to Bihar and United Provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Gandhi gradually realized the strength of Jinnah's hold over a segment of Muslim society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

In March 1947, the Muslim League successfully overthrew the coalition government in Punjab, a province crucial for their demand for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Riots erupted in Rawalpindi and later Lahore, further exacerbating [[impact_of_communal_tensions_on_indian_independence_process | communal tensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

### Mountbatten's Arrival and the Partition Plan

Frustrated by the ongoing riots, British Prime Minister Attlee appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten as India's last Viceroy on March 22, 1947, tasking him with negotiating and resolving the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

Mountbatten, who initially did not want India's partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, met Jinnah on April 5, 1947, and proposed a united India, but Jinnah rejected it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Meanwhile, Nehru and Sardar Patel were fed up with the Muslim League's constant interference in the interim government, accepting the idea of an independent Pakistan as the only way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

Gandhi, however, remained vehemently against partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. In a desperate attempt to prevent it, he proposed to Mountbatten on April 1, 1947, that Jinnah be made the Prime Minister of a united India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. Gandhi believed that 300 million Hindus could be governed by Jinnah if it kept the country united <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. While Mountbatten agreed to consider it if Congress consented, Nehru and Patel flatly refused, having experienced Jinnah's intransigence in the interim government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. This refusal was a "painful and shocking moment for Gandhi," as his long-time followers disobeyed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

With the Congress leadership reluctantly agreeing to partition, Mountbatten prepared a new plan, the "Dickie Bird Plan," on May 2, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. This plan controversially gave every province the option to join India or Pakistan, or remain independent, a clause originally intended only for Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Jinnah even approved of this "three-nation theory," believing that people in Bengal were vastly different from those in West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

However, Nehru was furious, recognizing that if the 559 princely states also had this option, India would "disintegrate" into "500 fragments," leading to "Balkanisation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. Mountbatten immediately tasked political commission V.P. Menon to prepare a revised plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### The Mountbatten Plan and its Aftermath

V.P. Menon swiftly drafted a new partition plan: power would be transferred to two independent British Dominions, India and Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. Provinces would be divided based on their elected representatives, with Bengal and Punjab being split into two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. While Jinnah requested referendums in the Northwest Frontier Province and Baluchistan, Menon accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Mountbatten also strongly advised princely states to join either India or Pakistan based on geographical contiguity, minimizing their chances of remaining independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

On June 3, 1947, this revised plan was presented and accepted by all major leaders, including Nehru, Patel, Jinnah, and Liaquat Ali Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. While no one was entirely happy, compromises were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

On August 15, 1947, at midnight, Pandit Nehru hoisted the Indian flag, marking India's freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. The partition, however, led to immense human tragedy:
*   Approximately 15 million people migrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   Over 1 million people were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   Forced religious conversions occurred overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   More than 75,000 women were kidnapped and raped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

Following partition, Sardar Patel worked tirelessly to integrate the princely states into the new Indian Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. India received dominion status in 1947, achieving complete freedom as an independent republic only in 1950 with the implementation of its constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

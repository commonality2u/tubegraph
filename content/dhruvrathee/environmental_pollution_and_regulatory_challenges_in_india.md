The film *Jawan* highlights significant environmental issues, particularly how industrial factories pollute India's air and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The film suggests that environmental regulations in India are very favorable for large companies compared to other developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Industrial Pollution and its Impact

Environmental pollution in India is a pervasive and alarming issue, extending beyond isolated incidents to become a common occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Water Pollution

Rivers across India face severe contamination:
*   In 2006, iron ore mining in Chhattisgarh led to the pollution of two rivers, forcing villagers in 100 affected areas to use contaminated water for daily needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   A 2013 report by the Centre for Science and Environment revealed that 80% of Indian sewage is dumped untreated into rivers, primarily by thousands of factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   In 2017, it was reported that Maharashtra's polluting factories were making its rivers some of the filthiest in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   By 2021, Karnataka was reportedly dumping 1,746 million liters of sewage into rivers daily, with 40% of it untreated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   In April 2022, the water of the River Hindon in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, was deemed unsafe even for bathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   By September 2022, the River Damodar in Jharkhand had become toxic, causing illness among local people due to local power stations and mining companies dumping large amounts of ash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_polluted_water_on_public_health | impact of polluted water on public health]].
*   A 2023 report by the Central Pollution Control Board identified 413 industries in Haryana discharging untreated waste into rivers, with Panipat having 181 polluting factories and Gurgaon over 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Government Efforts to Clean the Ganga River

The film references the [[government_efforts_and_failures_to_clean_ganga | government efforts and failures to clean Ganga]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   In September 2018, Magsaysay Award winner and environmentalist Rajendra Singh stated that the government's Namami Ganga project was failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   In October 2018, G.D. Agarwal (Swami Gyan Swaroop Sananand), an IIT graduate turned sadhu, went on a 111-day fast to demand a Ganga Protection Act and a ban on quarrying and stone crushing along the river banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. He received no reply to his letter to PM Modi and passed away due to starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   The original Namami Ganga project, with a budget of ₹200 billion, had a deadline of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   In the current year, Namami Ganga Mission 2 was approved with a budget of ₹225 billion and a deadline of 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The objective of this mission is to meet water quality criteria for outdoor bathing, not to make the water drinkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Regulatory Challenges

The issue of [[government_regulatory_failures | Government Regulatory Failures]] is a recurring theme.

### Pesticide Regulation
*   Some pesticides banned in other countries are still allowed in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   In 2013, the Anupam Verma Committee was formed to investigate 116 dangerous pesticides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. This committee reviewed only 66 pesticides and submitted its report in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   Despite the report, the government remained inactive for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. When action was finally taken in 2018, only 12 pesticides were banned, and 6 others were slated for slow phase-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Thus, out of 116, steps were taken to ban only 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   Another committee under S.K. Malhotra in 2020 recommended banning 27 more pesticides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   In 2022, the government formed yet another committee, which only banned 3 pesticides in February 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   In July 2023, the Supreme Court questioned the government's approach of forming multiple committees instead of taking action on reports regarding dangerous pesticides already banned elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### Food Safety: Antibiotic Use in Poultry
*   In 2017, experts reported that Indian poultry farms were using heavy doses of antibiotics, leading to antibiotic resistance reaching humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   The government set a permissible limit for antibiotic use in hens in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   However, a 2018 study by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that "India's farmed chickens are dosed with the world's strongest antibiotics," including Colistin, a last-resort antibiotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   The Union Health Ministries only banned Colistin in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   In contrast, the European Union banned antibiotics in animal feed in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, and a new legislation in January of the current year banned all types of antibiotics in farming and import of meat containing antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   Multinational food companies like KFC, Burger King, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell committed to not using antibiotics in their chicken in America by 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. However, when the Centre for Science and Environment contacted these companies in 2020 regarding their practices in India, they did not respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

The film's villain suggests that foreign investors should fund political parties to gain freedom to operate factories, use cheap labor, and spread pollution and waste in India without consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

[[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | The question of whether humans are the only intelligent species in the universe]] has led [[NASAs Voyager Missions | NASA]] to spearhead numerous projects aimed at sending messages to potential alien civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This ambition extends to [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | interstellar missions]], which involve exploring the vast [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | interstellar space]] – the regions between solar systems in galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## NASA's Interstellar Spacecraft

To date, [[NASAs Voyager Missions | NASA]] has launched five [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | interstellar spacecraft]]: Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]], [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 2]], and New Horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Of these, only [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] and [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 2]] have successfully reached [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | interstellar space]], a journey that takes an extremely long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Voyager Missions

The [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager missions]] were conceived in 1965 when a [[NASAs Voyager Missions | NASA]] engineer noted a unique geometric alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune occurring in the late 1970s – an event that happens only once every 175 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This alignment allowed for a "Gravity Assist" principle, enabling [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] to use the gravitational force of these planets to gain speed and change trajectory with minimal fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

[[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 2]] was launched on August 20, 1977, followed by [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] on September 5, 1977, from [[NASAs Voyager Missions | NASA Kennedy Space Center]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Both [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] shared similar designs and were powered by three Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators, using the radioactive decay of plutonium, as solar panels become inefficient beyond Mars and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Each probe carried 10 scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, magnetometers, and a high-gain antenna for communication with Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Voyager 1's Journey and Discoveries

[[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] had a shorter and faster route than [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

*   **Jupiter (March 1979):** It provided the first clear photos of Jupiter and its moons, revealing its rings and discovering two new moons, increasing Jupiter's known moons from 13 to 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It also discovered ongoing volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io, marking the first time humans observed active volcanoes on another planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Saturn (November 1980):** [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] discovered three new moons: Atlas, Prometheus, and Pandora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It captured images of many of Saturn's moons, with Titan being particularly interesting due to evidence of liquid water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Beyond the Ecliptic Plane:** After Saturn, [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] changed its trajectory to leave the Ecliptic Plane, the imaginary plane where most solar system planets orbit the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **The Pale Blue Dot (February 1990):** From 6 billion kilometers away, [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] took a famous photo known as the "Pale Blue Dot," showing Earth as a small blue dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. It also captured a "family portrait" of the inner solar system, including Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Entry into Interstellar Space:** After these photos, [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]]'s cameras were shut down to conserve power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. In 2004, it passed the Termination Shock, where solar wind suddenly decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. On August 25, 2012, [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] left the Heliosphere (the Sun's bubble of charged particles) and entered [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | interstellar space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This was confirmed by its plasma wave instruments, which detected a high electron density compared to the Heliosphere, indicative of [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | interstellar wind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. [[NASAs Voyager Missions | NASA]] confirmed this milestone in September 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Farthest Man-Made Object:** As of October 2024, [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] is 24.7 billion kilometers from Earth, making it the farthest man-made object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It travels at over 60,000 km per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Its power supply is expected to be entirely depleted by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
*   **Communication with Earth:** Data from [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] is transmitted via its high-gain antenna and received by [[NASAs Voyager Missions | NASA]]'s three deep space network stations in California, Madrid, and Canberra, Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Voyager 2's Journey

[[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 2]] entered [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | interstellar space]] six years later, on November 5, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. It is the only [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] to have flown by Uranus (1986) and Neptune (1989), providing marvelous photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Messages for Aliens

Both [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 1]] and [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager 2]] carry messages intended for [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | alien]] civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While the [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager missions]] were not the first to send such messages, they carry more detailed information than their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

### Pioneer Plaques

Before the Voyagers, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 carried "Pioneer Plaques" – small gold-anodized aluminum plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. These 15 cm by 23 cm plates contain five engraved diagrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>:

*   A map showing the Sun's position relative to 14 Pulsars, providing information about our location in the galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   The planets of our [[understanding_exoplanets_and_habitability | solar system]], with an arrow pointing to Earth as the origin of the [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   A silhouette of the [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   Drawings of a man and a woman, attempting to show how humans look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

[[NASAs Voyager Missions | NASA]] described these plaques as "a mark of man," demonstrating human spiritual insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. However, these were basic, and [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager missions]] carried more detailed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

### The Voyager Golden Record

The [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager missions]] carry "Golden Records" – 12-inch gold-plated copper discs and phonograph records that store both voices and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Each [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager spacecraft]] has two such records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

The contents of the Golden Record are divided into four sections:

1.  **Scenes from Earth:** 115 images and diagrams providing information about Earth and its species, including basic mathematical, chemical, and physical definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. These images include:
    *   A white calibration circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
    *   Basic mathematical concepts, physical units, and definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.
    *   Diagrams of [[understanding_exoplanets_and_habitability | solar system]] parameters, including the Sun and all nine planets (including Pluto at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
    *   Individual photos of [[understanding_exoplanets_and_habitability | solar system]] objects like Mercury, Mars, Earth, and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
    *   Images with explanatory symbols, such as chemical formulas (e.g., Earth's atmosphere composition: N2 78/100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
    *   Models of chemical elements like hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus, representing life's fundamental blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
    *   Two images of DNA structures, explaining genetic information transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
    *   Microscopic details of cells and their division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
    *   20 images depicting human life and capabilities, including mouth functions (licking, eating, drinking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
    *   Photos of human structures like the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
    *   Notably, no images show negative aspects of humans like conflict or war, aiming to paint a hopeful and positive side of humanity, an "ideal version" as described by Sagan in his 1978 book, *Murmers of Earth: the Voyager Interstellar Record* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

2.  **Greetings from Earth:** Greetings spoken in 55 human languages, along with printed messages from then-American President Jimmy Carter and UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

3.  **Music from Earth:** 28 audio recordings of musical selections from diverse Earth cultures and eras, including Western and Eastern classical music, and an Indian song ("Jaat Kahan Ho" based on Raag Bhairavi by Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

4.  **Sounds of Earth:** 21 audio recordings of natural sounds from Earth, human activities, and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Decoding the Golden Record

To enable [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | aliens]] to understand the messages, [[NASAs Voyager Missions | NASA]] scientists included instructions for operating the phonograph in the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. These instructions are depicted in diagrams, not human languages, acknowledging the unlikelihood of [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | aliens]] understanding Earth languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

The images on the Golden Record are stored in audio form, a result of early [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] technology (69 KB data storage capacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. Photos were projected onto a screen, recorded by a television camera, and converted into audio waveforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. For [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | aliens]] to view these images, they would need to reverse this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. The instructions for this are also on the "interstellar envelope" of the record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

The fundamental question remains whether the [[NASAs Voyager Missions | Voyager spacecraft]] will ever reach an [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | alien]] civilization, and if so, whether that species will possess the intelligence to decode these complex messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

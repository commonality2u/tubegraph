Indian media has seen a significant shift in its landscape, particularly when comparing the era of the Congress government, the current BJP government, and the Vajpayee administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This shift has led to an "empire of lies" where "the truth is being revealed" but also where "the walls of lie are getting bigger day by day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Many [[fake_news_in_indian_media | fake messages]] are circulated, especially through platforms like WhatsApp, often concerning religion, country, or caste, which people tend to believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While media's responsibility is to expose lies and question the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, in India, statements are often approved by media without verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## State of Mainstream Media

The main media has, in many instances, "outsourced their duties & responsibility to other persons," which they were originally supposed to carry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Instead of highlighting critical issues like finance bills legalizing corruption, mainstream media might prioritize vague news or statements from politicians like Rahul Gandhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Comparatively, the [[differences_between_indian_and_foreign_media | differences between Indian and foreign media]] are stark, with India ranking 138 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, while developed countries are in the top 20-30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Foreign audiences often find Indian news channels resembling "comedy entertainment shows" due to their argumentative and often fact-deficient debates, particularly on religious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The respect for Indian media, once high around 2007, has gradually declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## The Rise of Independent Voices

In this environment, individuals like Dhruv Rathee, a YouTuber with a large following, and Pratik Sinha and his team from Ahmedabad, have taken on the role of exposing [[fake_news_in_indian_media | fake news]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Dhruv Rathee began his work in 2016 out of frustration with the situation in India and the circulation of [[fake_news_in_indian_media | fake news]] and photoshopped images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

> "The reason behind my start up was frustration and was tired of seeing what was going on in my nation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>

These independent creators aim to use social media as a platform to educate people and help them make informed decisions, such as researching candidates before voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

## Challenges Faced by Independent Journalists

Independent journalists in India face significant hurdles:

*   **Suppression and Lack of Mainstream Support:** Mainstream media will generally not support those who speak against them; instead, they attempt to suppress independent voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. For example, channels exposing media hypocrisy, like 'Peeing Human,' have faced copyright claims and attempts to shut them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **Personal Risk:** Exposing the truth often requires individuals to "personally risk yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Politicians surrounded by "untrue words" make it dangerous to expose them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Troll Armies and Censorship:** Independent journalists are often subjected to abuse from "troll armies" in comments, which serves as a form of censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Lack of Institutional Support:** Unlike in countries like America, where a journalist questioning a president might receive support from various organizations, independent journalists in India may not receive similar backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Time and Effort:** Creating well-researched content for a single video can take Dhruv Rathee 22-24 hours, spread across two to three days, as he works alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Security Concerns:** Independent journalists often keep their whereabouts confidential due to threats received for questioning the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Public Perception and Polarization:** Social media can create "bubbles" where people only see and follow opinions they agree with, leading to polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. In India, mainstream media contributes to this division, while abroad, social media plays a similar role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Funding and Support Systems

Despite the challenges, independent journalists like Dhruv Rathee receive support from family, friends, and followers who understand the importance of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Dhruv Rathee funds his work through crowd donations from approximately 500 people, mostly Indians and some NRIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. This support for "right accountability" is considered "a part of democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

While challenges remain, independent journalism strives to educate the public and counter the prevalence of [[fake_news_in_indian_media | fake news]], slowly but surely reaching more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

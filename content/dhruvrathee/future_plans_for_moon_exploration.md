After the [[apollo_11_moon_landing_recount | Apollo 11 mission]], the last human mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, took place in December 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. For almost 50 years since then, no other person has traveled to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This long hiatus is attributed partly to the high cost of the Apollo program, which involved over 400,000 engineers, scientists, and technicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, amounting to $24 billion at the time, or over $100 billion in today's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Reasons for the Hiatus

Initially, criticism of the moon missions came from journalists, highlighting that the money spent on moon exploration could have built 120 Harvard-sized universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. By 1972, the general public's fascination with NASA and the Moon waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. Ongoing issues like the Vietnam War and increasing citizen problems led to the space program being viewed as a waste of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, resulting in significant budget cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This shift in [[public_and_governmental_interest_in_space_exploration_postapollo_missions | public and governmental interest in space exploration post-Apollo missions]] led to the cancellation of NASA's plans for missions up to Apollo 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

## Renewed Interest and the Artemis Program

In December 2017, former US President Donald Trump announced plans to increase funding to send American astronauts back to the Moon by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. However, he later shifted focus, suggesting NASA should prioritize Mars exploration over the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

Despite these changes, NASA has once again made concrete plans to send humans back to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This initiative is known as the **Artemis Program** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

### Artemis Program Goals

*   **Initial Testing**: The program will commence with tests using unmanned rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **First Woman on the Moon**: NASA aims to send the first woman to the Moon by 2025-2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **First Person of Color on the Moon**: Following this, there are plans to send the first person of color to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

It is anticipated that humans will return to the Moon before the end of the current decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

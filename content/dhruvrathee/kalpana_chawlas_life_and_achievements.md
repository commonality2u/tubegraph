On February 1, 2003, NASA's Columbia Space Shuttle was returning to Earth with seven astronauts aboard, one of whom was [[impact_of_kalpana_chawla_on_science_education_in_india | Kalpana Chawla]], a mission specialist and a figure of inspiration for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. After spending two weeks in space, their return, though anticipated by families, was considered a routine flight by NASA, being the 28th mission of the Space Mission Columbia program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

At 08:44 AM, as the shuttle re-entered Earth's atmosphere, systems appeared normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Ground communication was handled by Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) Charlie Hobaugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A few minutes later, Hobaugh discussed tire pressure readings with the astronauts, but the line was suddenly cut after Mission Commander Rick Husband uttered "Roger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Despite repeated attempts, communication could not be re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Unknown to the NASA team at the time, the Columbia Space Shuttle had exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. News channels soon began reporting the disaster, showing images of flaming debris falling over Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Hours later, President George Bush confirmed the loss of the Columbia and all seven astronauts, including the 40-year-old Indian-born American, Kalpana Chawla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Early Life and Education
Kalpana Chawla was born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, Haryana, into a conservative family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Her parents, Banarasilal and Sanjyoti Chawla, had immigrated to India from Pakistan during the partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. As their fourth and youngest child, she was initially called "Montu" at home and chose her formal name "Kalpana" (meaning imagination) when she started school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

From a young age, Chawla was interested in space, fascinated by planes flying in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. She frequently visited the local flying club with her father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Despite her parents, professors, and teachers discouraging her from pursuing a career in aerospace due to societal norms, especially for girls in Haryana in the 1960s, Kalpana remained determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Against her father's disapproval, she moved to America to complete her Master's degree at the University of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. In 1988, at 26 years old, she obtained her PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado and began working at NASA's Ames Research Center, specializing in Fluid Dynamics Aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## NASA Career and First Space Flight (STS-87)
Kalpana Chawla held multiple pilot licenses, capable of flying airplanes, gliders, and seaplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. After becoming an American citizen in 1991, she was selected by NASA in 1994, alongside 19 others out of 4,000 applicants, for astronaut training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### First Space Flight (STS-87)
In November 1997, after three years of training, Chawla embarked on her first space flight as a Mission Specialist on the Columbia program flight STS-87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. During this 16-day mission, she orbited the Earth over 250 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Her primary role was to operate the robotic arm to deploy the Spartan satellite for studying the sun's outer layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Though the 1,360 kg satellite initially went out of control and had to be retrieved after three days and a spacewalk, NASA scientists later praised Chawla, confirming the fault lay with another crew member, not her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This mission made her the first Indian-origin woman and the first South Asian-American woman to go to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Then-Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral congratulated her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### The Space Transportation System (STS) Program
STS, or Space Transportation System, was NASA's official space shuttle program, launched in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. It was the fourth human-space flight program after Project Mercury, Project Gemini, and the Apollo program, and became the longest in history, running until 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Its focus was on reusability, aiming to launch the same shuttles repeatedly to avoid building new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

The program primarily used two main shuttles: Challenger and Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. After the Columbia disaster, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavor were also utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Columbia was the first space shuttle to go into space in April 1981 and had completed 27 successful missions before the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The STS program's design for reusability, involving extensive inspection and repair after each flight, was not the cause of the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Second and Final Space Flight (STS-107)
On January 16, 2003, at 10:29 AM, the Columbia Space Shuttle launched for its final mission, STS-107 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This mission, originally planned for 2001, had been delayed 13 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The crew of seven included Commander Rick Husband, Payload Commander Michael Anderson, Mission Specialists (including Kalpana Chawla), Pilot William McCool, and Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon from the Israel Space Agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

Their mission was to conduct non-stop experiments for 24 hours, working in shifts over 16 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. They performed around 80 experiments in life sciences, material science, and fluid physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Kalpana Chawla specifically focused on microgravity research, including combustion in space, fire suppression, crystal growth, and even how prostate cancer cells grow in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The collaboration with Spacehab allowed universities, companies, and government agencies worldwide to conduct research without physically sending their own personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Children from six schools across Australia, China, Israel, Japan, and the USA also had their experiments carried out by the astronauts, observing reactions of spiders, silkworms, organic crystals, fish, bees, and ants in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Interestingly, it was discovered that the smell of flowers changes in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. About 30% of the experiment data was successfully transmitted to Earth, and some videos were sent back to the children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

Notably, a live group of roundworms stored in aluminum canisters survived the disaster with minor heat damage, found alive in Petri dishes among the recovered pieces of the shuttle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Descendants of these roundworms were later sent on the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 2011, the second-to-last STS program mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## The Columbia Disaster
The Columbia disaster was not caused by pilot error or hasty decisions by the crew; none of the seven astronauts made any mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Until three to four minutes before the accident, they had no idea of the impending tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Warnings about lost tire pressure on the left side of the shuttle only appeared on their display at 8:58 AM, just one minute before the signal was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### The Real Cause: Foam Strike and Negligence
The true cause of the disaster lay in an incident that occurred 81 seconds after Columbia's launch: a small piece of foam, approximately 60 cm long and 40 cm wide, weighing only 750 grams, detached from the external tank and struck the shuttle's left wing at an estimated velocity of 700-900 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Two to three days after the launch, NASA engineers requested pictures to assess the damage to the space shuttle, suggesting the use of American spy satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. However, STS Program Manager Ron D. Dittemore refused this request, a decision he later acknowledged as a mistake when he resigned in April 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### Investigation Findings
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) was formed to investigate the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Their thorough report, released in August 2003, detailed the cause and pointed to NASA's negligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The failure to monitor the damage caused by the foam strike meant the mission continued for 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

Upon re-entry on February 1, the small hole in the left wing caused by the foam strike enlarged as air leaked, compromising the thermal protection system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This led to a large piece of insulation breaking off, exposing the shuttle to external fire and gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Sensors in the left wing failed, followed by the loss of tire pressure readings, and the spacecraft began to disintegrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

The CAIB report also noted that such foam strikes were common during space shuttle launches, having been observed in 65 of 79 prior missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. The issue was that this particular piece of foam hit "the wrong place at the wrong time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. A 2008 report, "Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report," concluded that due to the violent disintegration and loss of cabin pressure, the astronauts passed away within seconds and did not suffer from heat or damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

Following the incident, NASA suspended the space shuttle program for two and a half years and redesigned the foam ramp to prevent similar accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. The program continued until the International Space Station became fully functional, wrapping up in July 2011 after 135 missions over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. In total, 14 astronauts lost their lives in unfortunate accidents during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

## Legacy
Despite the tragedy, [[impact_of_kalpana_chawla_on_science_education_in_india | Kalpana Chawla's impact]] endures, particularly in science education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. She was deeply passionate about ensuring every girl in India received a science education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. She persuaded NASA to allow students from her secondary school in Karnal, Tagore Bal Niketan Senior Secondary School, to participate in NASA's Summer Space Experience Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Since 1998, two girls from the school have annually traveled to Houston, America, for the Foundation for International Space Education's United Space School, and Chawla would often invite them to her home for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

NASA has paid tribute to Kalpana Chawla and other Columbia crew members by naming the Mars landing site "Columbia Memorial Station" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. Additionally, asteroids between Mars and Jupiter have been named after the crew members, including asteroid 51826 Kalpana Chawla, which continues to orbit the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

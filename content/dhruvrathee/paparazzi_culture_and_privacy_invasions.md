The public perception of celebrity lives, particularly through social media, often contains many lies and frauds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. There is a significant question about the authenticity of what is shown to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Role of Paparazzi

The term 'Paparazzi' refers to individuals whose job is to photograph celebrities and high-profile people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The singular form is 'Paparazzo' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Origin of the Term
The word 'Paparazzi' originated from a 1960 Italian film titled *La Dolce Vita* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. A side character in the film, named Paparazzo, was an annoying yet fearless reporter who would go to any extent to photograph celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The film's director chose the name because 'Paparazzo' is an Italian slang term for a large, annoying mosquito, which he felt accurately depicted the reporter's persistent personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

In 1961, *Time* magazine featured an article on paparazzi, further popularizing the word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The article described paparazzi as "a pack of hungry wolves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> due to their practice of secretly taking photos of celebrities without permission or regard for their privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Notorious Incidents
The infamous 1997 car accident that led to Princess Diana's death was significantly linked to paparazzi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Paparazzi cars were reportedly following her vehicle, leading the driver to speed up, which contributed to the crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This incident prompted global questioning of the ethical boundaries of paparazzi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Paparazzi Culture in India
In India, the paparazzi culture began in the 1990s, coinciding with economic liberalization and the rise of tabloid culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Magazines like Stardust, Midday, Bombay Times, and Page 3 gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. India's first paparazzo is known as Yogen Shah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Before the internet, paparazzi would take candid photos of popular celebrities and sell them to magazines and tabloids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This became popular due to public curiosity about celebrities' private lives in the absence of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## The Evolution of Fake Hype

With the advent of social media, the paparazzi system has shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. A new model involves paparazzi directly taking money from celebrities to click "candid" photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Many paparazzi openly admit to this practice, particularly with smaller stars who pay for publicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

This has led to two models:
1.  Celebrities who desire publicity pay paparazzi for PR and public exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
2.  Top A-list celebrities, like Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan, and Virat Kohli, who don't need publicity but whose photos are still desired by the public, are photographed secretly by paparazzi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### [[authenticity_of_celebrity_social_media_posts | Authenticity of Celebrity Social Media Posts]]
The vast majority of celebrity photos seen on social media and in newspapers are not authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It is estimated that 90% of celebrity content on social media, TV, and newspapers are [[paid_social_media_trends_and_fake_pr | paid promotions]] and "fake acting," with only 10% being authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Many celebrities appear on podcasts and interviews only when their movies are about to be released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Social media pages dedicated to celebrities often feature [[paid_social_media_trends_and_fake_pr | paid promotion]] posts that can be difficult to identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. An example is an "Instant Bollywood" Instagram post that mistakenly copied a celebrity's requested caption for a [[paid_social_media_trends_and_fake_pr | paid promotion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

> [!INFO] [[paid_social_media_trends_and_fake_pr | Paid Social Media Trends]]
> Hashtags for new movies often trend on Twitter, accompanied by numerous tweets praising the film, which are often fake and managed by PR companies using similar language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. These PR accounts also promote various companies and even political parties, sometimes on the same account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Corporate Bookings and Box Office Numbers
A new trend for creating hype is "corporate bookings," where film producers book tickets themselves to distribute to companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This makes it appear as if shows are houseful, motivating other people to watch the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. In 2023, a Bollywood film spent ₹200 million on corporate bookings, and two other films spent around ₹700 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Despite shows being marked houseful, halls often remain empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This practice raises questions about the authenticity of reported box office collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

Some individuals also engage in "self-booking" to inflate their film's box office numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. In corporate booking, film stars request brands they work with to buy tickets and distribute them to employees, thereby boosting box office figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Fake Awards
The hype around films and celebrities can be fake, as can box office numbers, and even awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Shah Rukh Khan once recounted attempting to bribe an editor for a "Best Actor" award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Today, accusations of awards being bought and sold are common across industries, leading to a loss of credibility for award shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Alia Bhatt openly confessed that she would not have attended an award show if she wasn't receiving an award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

Award shows have introduced many random categories, such as "Hot&Techy 'Performer of the Year'" and "'Nothing to Hide Award,'" seemingly to give awards to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Similarly, influencer awards feature numerous new categories like "Trendsetter of the Year" and "Emerging Fashion Influencer Award" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. These awards often come with conditions, such as direct payment or indirect promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

## Celebrity Privacy Invasions and Protection

Most Bollywood celebrities could maintain their privacy if they chose to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. However, some, like Kim Kardashian, are widely photographed by paparazzi, with claims that her photos are personally edited before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Kylie Jenner allegedly staged a fake "candid" photoshoot after unflattering real candid photos went viral post-COVID lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

There are genuine instances where celebrities are fed up with paparazzi, such as Jaya Bachchan's clear displeasure with being filmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Cases of privacy invasion include paparazzi photographing Alia Bhatt inside her home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a> and someone taking a video of Virat Kohli's hotel room and his belongings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

Celebrities employ various methods to protect their privacy:
*   Katrina Kaif and Vicky Kaushal's wedding reportedly prohibited photos inside the venue, and drones would have been shot down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   Hollywood celebrities like Beyoncé, Paris Hilton, and Nick Jonas use an anti-paparazzi scarf that blocks cameras from capturing their photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   Taylor Swift uses a decoy car to avoid paparazzi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## [[celebrity_influence_on_public_perception_and_behavior | Impact on Public Perception]]

The fake world of celebrities can easily fool people who are unaware of these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This leads to unrealistic expectations about appearance, success, and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Some individuals undergo extensive cosmetic surgeries to resemble celebrities, believing it to be the ideal look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. There are many people undergoing plastic surgeries due to [[celebrity_influence_on_public_perception_and_behavior | celebrity influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

Additionally, some people are influenced by this fake hype and develop dangerous levels of fan worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. For example, a fan of Kannada actor Yash self-immolated because he couldn't meet the actor on his birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Dangers of Fake Hype
> The dangers of this fake glamorous hype now threaten the film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. If genuine actors and films are not promoted, the industry risks losing public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. While people might be fooled by fake hype once or twice, repeated promotion of bad films and actors, and inauthentic images, will eventually lead to public disillusionment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

It is advisable to watch films for enjoyment but to avoid wasting time on the fake world of celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. This also extends to shows like Bigg Boss, with further details on why [[impact_of_reality_tv_shows_on_society_and_mental_health | reality TV shows are detrimental]] available in another video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

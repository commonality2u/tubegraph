About 100 million years ago, Earth was a vastly different place, ruled by large, often terrifying creatures known as dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Some were taller than buildings, while others could run at speeds of around 90 km/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Dinosaurs dominated Earth for over 170 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> before a catastrophic event led to their demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Origin of the Term "Dinosaur"

The word "Dinosaur" originated from Greek words: "Denios" (Terrible) and "Sauros" (Lizard), literally meaning "Terrible Lizard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This term was first used in 1841 by British scientist Richard Owen, following the discovery of dinosaur fossils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Early depictions of dinosaurs, like the Megalosaurus, were significantly different from current understanding due to limited knowledge at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Today, paleontologists worldwide have unearthed over 10,000 dinosaur fossils, identifying more than 900 distinct species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Between 2003 and 2022, an average of 45 new dinosaur species were identified each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Recent discoveries include the Stegouros Elengassen from Chile, noted for its blade-like tail weapon and beak-like mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## The Triassic Period: Early Beginnings

Scientists estimate that the first dinosaurs emerged approximately 230-240 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The oldest dinosaur fossil, found in Africa, dates back 231.4 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

During this period, Earth's continents were joined in a single supercontinent called Pangaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The climate was predominantly dry and arid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Early dinosaurs, unlike their later, larger descendants, were relatively small, often around 2 meters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The Eoraptor, for instance, is considered an ancestor of other dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The dominant animals of the Triassic were giant reptiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### The Triassic-Jurassic Extinction Event

Around 201 million years ago, the Triassic period concluded with a sudden climate change and the breakup of Pangaea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This period, though sudden in geological terms, occurred gradually over thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Large-scale volcanic eruptions released vast amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, leading to intense global warming, subsequent cooling due to blocked sunlight, and ocean acidification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Most cold-blooded reptiles struggled with these drastic temperature shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, dinosaurs, being warm-blooded, were better equipped to tolerate the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The volcanic activity and climate change persisted for about 600,000 years, causing the extinction of nearly all other species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Only dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and early mammals survived this [[extinction_of_dinosaurs_due_to_asteroid_impact | Triassic-Jurassic Extinction Event]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## The Jurassic Period: Dinosaur Dominance

The Jurassic period, lasting from 201 million to 145 million years ago, saw dinosaurs emerge as the planet's most dominant species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Through evolution, some species grew to immense sizes, such as the early Titanosaurus, which could weigh up to 15,000 kg and be 15 meters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

During this time, some dinosaurs evolved the ability to fly, with Archaeopteryx being one of the first feathered dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Pangaea further divided into two smaller supercontinents: Laurasia and Gondwanaland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## The Cretaceous Period: Apex of Diversity

The Cretaceous period, from 145 million to 65 million years ago, marked the peak of dinosaur diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Many new species evolved, including the famous Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex), which reached peak dominance towards the end of this period, around 65-68 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Contrary to popular film portrayals, most scientists believe T-Rex did not exist during the Jurassic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Interestingly, humans are closer in time to the T-Rex than the T-Rex was to the Jurassic Period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

During the Cretaceous period, Laurasia and Gondwanaland continued to break apart, forming continents similar to their modern arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Flowering plants evolved, and Earth's average temperature was warmer than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This period saw the existence of almost every imaginable type of dinosaur, including Raptors, Armored Dinosaurs, giant herbivores, and dangerous carnivores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Notable dinosaurs of this era included:
*   **Titanosaurus**: Among the largest land animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Argentinosaurus**: Could weigh up to 77 tonnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **T-Rex**: Up to 40 feet long, considered the apex predator with the strongest jaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Ornithomimids**: Resembling ostriches, they were among the fastest dinosaurs, reaching speeds of 80 km/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Quetzalcoatlus**: The largest flying dinosaur, with a wingspan of 10-11 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Grass only began evolving around 70 million years ago, so the Earth during these periods was not grass-filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The Cretaceous period was the most prosperous for dinosaurs, with favorable climates, evolving species, and no significant animal competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## The End of the Dinosaurs: The K-Pg Extinction Event

The Cretaceous period ended 66 million years ago with a massive asteroid impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. A large asteroid, roughly 10-15 km in diameter, crashed into the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico at 30 km per second, 150 times faster than a jet airliner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The impact created an 180 km diameter crater and released energy equivalent to 100 teratonnes of TNTâ€”a billion times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Immediate and Long-Term Effects:
*   **Initial Blast**: Everything disintegrated instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Hot dust rained down, raising global temperatures for hours and cooking animals alive within thousands of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Only small animals, able to find shelter underground or underwater, survived this initial phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Catastrophes**: Shock waves, heat pulses, widespread wildfires, and massive tsunamis (potentially 2 km tall) followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Volcanic eruptions, acid rain, and earthquakes also occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Winter**: Dust particles in the atmosphere blocked sunlight for about a year, plunging the planet into a "nuclear winter" for three years with freezing temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This halted photosynthesis, killing plants, which then led to the death of herbivores and subsequently carnivores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Survivors**: Only small omnivorous animals like mammals, lizards, turtles, and some [[birds_as_modern_descendants_of_dinosaurs | birds]] survived by scavenging on dead matter, fungus, and decaying plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The impact also released carbon and sulfur, leading to reduced sunlight and acid rain for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. After the dust settled, increased carbon dioxide caused intense global warming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

This event, the 5th extinction event in Earth's history, caused over 75% of plant and animal species to go extinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. No four-legged creature weighing more than 25 kg survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. All terrestrial dinosaurs vanished forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### The Paleogene Period and Legacy

The [[extinction_of_dinosaurs_due_to_asteroid_impact | asteroid strike]] created an opportunity for other animal species to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The vacuum left by dinosaurs allowed for the rapid evolution of mammals, including horses, whales, bats, and primates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Snakes and smaller lizards also emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

The only group of dinosaurs that survived were the flying dinosaurs, which gradually evolved into the [[birds_as_modern_descendants_of_dinosaurs | birds we see today]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Studies confirm that birds belong to the same family as dinosaurs, with chickens and ostriches sharing the closest ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The closest living relative of the T-Rex is believed to be the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Evidence of the Impact

The asteroid impact is evidenced by a rare mineral, Iridium, found in high concentrations in certain places on Earth, despite its scarcity in Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Comets and asteroids, however, have high concentrations of Iridium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Carbon dating of this Iridium layer confirms it is 66 million years old, coinciding with the extinction event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

The impact crater itself is hidden in the Yucatan Peninsula, with half submerged under the sea and half on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. The circular pattern of cenotes (sinkholes) in this Mexican region marks the ring formation around the crater, serving as a visible reminder of the catastrophic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Modern Extinction and the Future

Today, NASA and other space agencies track Near Earth Asteroids to predict potential collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. As of April 2022, over 28,000 such asteroids have been identified, with more than 800 exceeding 1 km in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Scientific advancements allow for precise path prediction and collision probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. Missions like NASA's DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) in 2021 successfully demonstrated the ability to alter an asteroid's path, offering a defense against future threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

However, scientists believe the 6th [[extinction_of_dinosaurs_due_to_asteroid_impact | extinction event]], the Holocene Extinction Event, has already begun, primarily caused by human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Over the last 100-200 years, biodiversity loss due to deforestation, pollution, and habitat destruction has reached unprecedented levels, with current extinction rates 100-1,000 times higher than normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Thousands of species are now endangered or extinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

International efforts, like the 2010 UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2020 Paris-style plan, aim to protect 30% of land and oceans and reduce pollution by 50% by 2030, with a goal to limit extinctions to 20 or fewer per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. The survival of humans may depend on these collective efforts, especially when considering that dinosaurs dominated for 174 million years, 600 times longer than humans have existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

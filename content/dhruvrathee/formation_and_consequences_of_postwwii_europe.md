After the surrender of Germany in May 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, the European landscape underwent significant changes, leading to new geopolitical structures and international cooperation initiatives. This period was marked by the division of German territories, the redrawing of national borders, and the establishment of organizations aimed at fostering peace and economic stability.

## Immediate Aftermath in Germany and Europe

Following Germany's formal surrender on May 8, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, its territories were divided, leading to the formation of East and West Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Poland was also recreated, incorporating a large part of what was formerly East Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. The borders of many other countries across Europe were redrawn, fundamentally shaping the map of Europe as it is seen today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>, which was completely different from the map before [[causes_of_world_war_ii | World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## New International Relations

A significant outcome was the end of the long-standing enmity between Germany and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. When a new government was formed in Germany, it established cordial relations with France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

### Economic Cooperation and the European Union

To foster cooperation between France and Germany, the European Coal and Steel Committee was initially formed to facilitate trade in coal and steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Years later, neighboring countries such as Italy and Britain joined this initiative, expanding trade further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. This collaborative effort eventually led to the formation of the European Union in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, an organization designed to erase borders between European countries and prevent future conflicts like [[causes_of_world_war_ii | World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

## Establishment of Global Organizations

In October 1945, the United Nations was established with the primary goal of preventing future World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Following this, frameworks for the World Bank, IMF, and NATO were also set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Notably, the permanent members of the United Nations were the Allied Forces countries from [[causes_of_world_war_ii | World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

Even after Germany's surrender, [[causes_of_world_war_ii | World War II]] was not entirely over, as Japan took another two months to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Japan was given an ultimatum in July 1945, but upon its disregard, America dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

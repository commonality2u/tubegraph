Near Earth Objects (NEOs) are celestial bodies, such as asteroids and comets, that pass close to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. While most orbit safely, some pose a considerable risk of collision with Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The potential for such impacts is a justified concern, as a similar event occurred 66 million years ago, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Types of Space Rocks

Space is filled with various pieces of rock, which are categorized differently based on their composition, size, and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>:

*   **Asteroids** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
    *   Also known as Planetoids, they are large pieces of rock and metal orbiting in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Their diameter can range from 10-20 metres to 100-200 kilometres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The smallest discovered is 2 metres wide, and the largest, Ceres, is 940 kilometres in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   Most asteroids are found in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, which houses millions of asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   The average distance between any two asteroids in the belt is more than 1 million kilometres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Comets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
    *   Composed of ice, rocks, and dust, sometimes referred to as "Dirty Snowballs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   Typically found in the Kuiper Belt, located beyond Neptune and far from the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   Comets have a visible tail when moving through space, which asteroids do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   They can be large, with diameters of 1-10 kilometres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, and are often visible to the naked eye when passing by Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   Comets are considered more dangerous than asteroids due to traveling at twice the speed and offering shorter warning times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The film "Don't Look Up" depicted a scenario with only a 6-month warning for a comet collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Meteoroid**: A small piece of an asteroid or comet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Meteor**: A meteoroid that enters Earth's atmosphere, burning up quickly and appearing as a streak of light, also known as a "shooting star" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Large numbers of meteors create a "Meteor Shower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Meteorite**: A piece of a meteor that travels through Earth's atmosphere and falls onto the Earth's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Debunking Asteroid Strike News

### The 2038 Asteroid Strike Claim

News circulating on social media about a 72% chance of an asteroid colliding with Earth in 2038 is [[2038_fake_asteroid_strike_news | completely fake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This percentage came from a hypothetical scenario created by NASA for a mock exercise to assess preparedness against an asteroid impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Over 100 experts from various organizations, including NASA, the European Space Agency, and the UN Office of Outer Space Affairs, participated in this mock test to discuss steps to prevent an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### The Apophis Asteroid

The Apophis asteroid, over 1000 feet in diameter, will pass by Earth on April 13, 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. It will be only 30,000 kilometres away, closer than many geostationary satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This asteroid will be visible to the naked eye at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Discovered in 2004, initial observations suggested a 2.7% chance of collision in 2029, causing significant concern and earning it the name "City Killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Apophis is named after a giant snake from Egyptian mythology that destroys everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. However, further scientific observations have confirmed a 0% chance of collision with Earth in 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Although there were initial concerns about future close passes in 2036 or 2068 due to gravitational effects (Keyhole Area), NASA has confidently stated that Apophis will not collide with Earth in the next 100 years and has removed it from the Near-Earth Objects risk list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Asteroid Risk Management

Space agencies worldwide maintain a "Risk List" of potentially dangerous asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This list provides details on impact date, probability, and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Data Science plays a crucial role in accurately predicting asteroid paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Some notable objects on the risk list include:

1.  **2023VD3 Asteroid**: Discovered in 2023, it is 11-24 metres wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. It has a 0.25% chance (1 in 387) of colliding with Earth on November 8, 2034 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Despite its substantial probability, its small size means it's not very dangerous, likely causing minimal damage if it impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

    *   **Chelyabinsk Meteor Incident (2013)**: A similar 20-metre wide meteor exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in February 2013, releasing a powerful shockwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
        > "It came out of nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> a bright speck in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> seen streaking across the horizon. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> Followed by an almost apocalyptic scene. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> A blinding flash of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> and then, all hell broke loose." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
        > "Nearly 1,500 people were injured. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> Most of them suffered cuts from shattered windows." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>
        Although some buildings were damaged and people injured, no lives were lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This event highlighted the challenge of detecting small, rapidly approaching objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
2.  **1979XB Asteroid**: With a diameter of 400-900 metres, this large asteroid has a negligible 0.00002% chance (1 in 4.27 million) of impacting Earth on December 12, 2056 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Its size, however, keeps it high on the risk list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</sup>.
3.  **2008JL3 Asteroid**: This asteroid is estimated to be 23-50 metres in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. It has a 0.01% chance (1 in 6,711) of impact on May 1, 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</sup>.

## [[Scientific Detection Projects for Space Threats | Scientific Detection Projects for Space Threats]]

Earth's defense systems are robust, though small meteors can sometimes go undetected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Several prominent projects are dedicated to detecting NEOs:

*   **LINEAR (Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research)**: A collaboration between the US Air Force, NASA, and MIT, started in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. It uses two 1-metre and one 0.5-metre telescopes to discover over 10,000 objects annually, accounting for 65% of all discovered asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **CSS (Catalina Sky Survey)**: Established by the University of Arizona in 1998, it uses two large telescopes and provides precise measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. In 2008, CSS accurately predicted the time, day, and location of a 4-metre asteroid's fall in the North Sudan desert, 19 hours before impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</sup>.

## [[Planetary Defense Strategies | Planetary Defense Strategies]]

If a large asteroid threatens Earth, three main strategies are considered:

1.  **Kinetic Methods**: Involves sending a spacecraft to collide with the asteroid, thereby changing its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This method was successfully tested by NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission two years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. On September 26, 2022, DART successfully impacted the 170-metre-wide Dimorphous asteroid, demonstrating a change in its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</sup>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. China's National Space Agency plans a similar experiment in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
2.  **Slow Push and Pull Methods**: This involves gradually altering an asteroid's orbit, potentially using solar energy to vaporize parts of the asteroid, creating a small thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</sup>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
3.  **Nuclear Methods**: Involves sending a spacecraft with nuclear bombs to destroy an asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. This method is generally considered a last resort due to international legal issues and the risk of creating uncontrollable debris that could still hit Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. However, it remains an option for extremely large asteroids (over 10 km, like the one that caused the [[impact_of_asteroid_strikes_on_earth | extinction of dinosaurs]]) where other methods might be insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

In NASA's recent mock test (Planetary Defense Interagency Tabletop Exercise), 81% of participants expressed confidence in humanity's readiness to handle such threats, with identified gaps focusing on the need for more testing of the Kinetic Method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</sup>. This was the fifth such meeting, with previous ones held in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</sup>.

## Future Preparedness

Currently, there are no large asteroids with even a 0.01% chance of colliding with Earth in the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Earth's defense systems are continuously advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. In 2028, NASA plans to launch the Near Earth Object Surveyor, a space telescope stationed outside Earth, to further enhance asteroid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</sup>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Even if a threatening asteroid is discovered, adequate systems are in place to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</sup>.

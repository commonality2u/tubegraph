Blitzkrieg, a revolutionary warfare strategy developed by Adolf Hitler, enabled Germany to successfully invade several countries with speed and stealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The term "Blitz" in German means lightning, reflecting the strategy's emphasis on rapid, overwhelming attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Core Principles
The Blitzkrieg strategy focused on conducting wars as swiftly as possible, often wrapping up conflicts within less than a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Its key elements included:
*   **Rapid Advance:** Tanks were deployed to invade countries so quickly that opposing forces had no time to react or strategize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Air Support:** The German air force, known as the Luftwaffe, provided overhead support, ensuring invasions took place at lightning speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Supporting Factors
To maintain the relentless pace of Blitzkrieg, German soldiers were reportedly given drugs, most notably Pervitin (today known as Crystal Meth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This drug combated fatigue, eliminated the need for sleep, suppressed hunger and thirst, reduced pain, and boosted confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. While detrimental to long-term health, these substances were highly effective in enabling soldiers to fight day and night, concluding battles quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Notable Deployments
The effectiveness of the Blitzkrieg strategy was evident in Germany's early campaigns:

### Poland (September 1939)
Despite Great Britain and France declaring war on Germany after its ultimatum regarding Poland was ignored, no military support was provided to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Poland's outdated army, which still utilized horses, could not withstand Germany's modern military strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Approximately 1.3 million Polish troops were mobilized, but the German army defeated them in less than a week, occupying Poland by September 8, 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Poland was subsequently partitioned between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Norway and Denmark (April 1940)
Hitler's plans to control Norway and Denmark were executed on April 9, 1940, using the Blitzkrieg strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. These small nations could not compete with the German Army, and their invasions were swiftly concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The Norwegian government fled to London, establishing a Government in Exile, while Hitler installed a pro-Nazi puppet government in Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg (May 1940)
On May 10, 1940, Hitler launched an all-out attack on these countries, demonstrating his intent to continue expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This engagement, known as the Battle of France, involved over 1,000 fighter-bomber airplanes and approximately 3 million German ground soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

The German troops were divided into three groups:
*   **Group B:** Attacked the Netherlands and then entered Belgium to engage Allied forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Group C:** Created a distraction by attacking France's Maginot Line, a 450 km long fortification on its Eastern border, which French military experts believed to be impenetrable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   **Group A (Master Plan):** Secretly invaded France through the Ardennes Forest, an area deemed too difficult for a military invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Over 40,000 military vehicles were used for this surprise entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

On May 15, 1940, Group A captured Sedan and proceeded northward, encircling British forces fighting Group B in Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This trapped approximately 400,000 Allied (British and French) troops on the beaches of Dunkirk, with the sea as their only escape route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Operation Dynamo, launched on May 26, 1940, became the largest evacuation in military history, successfully rescuing nearly 350,000 soldiers by June 4, 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Despite the evacuation, most of the Allied military equipment was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. France surrendered to Hitler on June 22, 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

By July 1940, Hitler's Germany, bolstered by its successful Blitzkrieg campaigns, had established control over Austria, Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This left Britain as the primary remaining opponent, as the United States had not yet entered World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is being called a dictator by protestors amid widespread student demonstrations against the government's quota system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These protests, which began peacefully, escalated into violence, prompting the government to take significant measures to control the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Government Response to Protests

In response to the protests, Bangladesh's government implemented several restrictive measures:
*   Schools and colleges across the country were shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Mobile internet services were suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   A military curfew was declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, with troops on the streets and a near blackout of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Violent clashes resulted in at least 150 deaths and thousands of injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   Paramilitary troops were called in, and police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound grenades against protestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

The United Nations Secretary-General issued a statement urging the government to refrain from using threats or violence against protestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Clashes also occurred between protestors and the Bangladesh's Student League, the student wing of the ruling Awami League Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Under pressure, the government formed a Judicial Probe Committee to investigate incidents of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The Awami League General Secretary stated that the government would not interfere with the quotas and that everyone should await the Supreme Court's decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. However, the main group of protestors, Students Against Discrimination, expressed doubt about the government's intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Accusations of Dictatorship

Protestors have explicitly called Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This accusation is fueled by several factors, including the government's harsh response to dissent and the Prime Minister's rhetoric.

### "Razakar" Remarks

Amidst the tense situation, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made what protestors considered irresponsible remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. She questioned why protestors "hate the freedom fighters" and whether the grandchildren of "Razakars" should be given benefits if freedom fighters' grandchildren don't receive reservation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

The term "Razakar" holds significant negative connotations in Bangladesh, referring to a paramilitary group that supported the West Pakistan army and participated in atrocities during the 1971 Liberation War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. In Bangladesh, "Razakar" means treacherous and anti-national <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

The Prime Minister's Social Welfare Minister, Dipu Moni, and State Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Muhammad Ali Arafat, also made similar statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Critics argue that calling protestors "traitors" for opposing a government reservation policy is an old strategy to discredit dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This is seen as a clear-cut example of the straw man fallacy, distorting the protestors' argument to present it in a negative light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### Electoral Rigging Allegations

Sheikh Hasina won her fourth consecutive term in January, but these elections were met with accusations of electoral rigging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. This contributes to the broader [[challenges_to_indian_democracy_and_opposition | challenges to democracy]] and fuels [[concerns_about_dictatorship_in_india | concerns about dictatorship]] or that Bangladesh [[is_india_moving_towards_dictatorship | is moving towards dictatorship]].

## Broader Context of Dissent and Governance

The protestors' slogans, such as "Who are you? Who am I? Razakar! Razakar! Who says? Who says? The Dictator! The Dictator!" directly associate Sheikh Hasina with dictatorial tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

The situation in Bangladesh highlights broader issues of [[government_suppression_of_dissent_and_media | government suppression of dissent and media]]. The suspension of internet services and the use of force against protestors are seen as attempts to control information and quell opposition.

### Media Portrayal

Indian media outlets have also been criticized for their portrayal of the protests. Sudhir Chaudhary of Aaj Tak labelled the student protests as "foreign-funded," claiming America and other Western countries were behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Such narratives are seen as part of a trend of [[medias_role_in_questioning_government_actions | media's role in questioning government actions]] being undermined or twisted, mirroring [[criticisms_of_modis_claims_and_portrayal | criticisms of Modi's claims and portrayal]] in India.

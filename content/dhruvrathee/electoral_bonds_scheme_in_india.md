The [[electoral_bond_scam|Electoral Bond Scam]] is described as potentially the biggest scam and extortion racket in the history of independent India, not a standalone event but a collection of scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It can be summarized as a "tenders and kickbacks" model where business opportunities are granted in exchange for kickbacks, or companies are targeted by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) if they don't comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Introduction of the Scheme
The [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact|Electoral Bonds Scheme]] was introduced by the Modi government in 2017, becoming a method for political parties to collect kickbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced its contours for political party funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. A key feature was that all actions under this scheme were hidden from the public, meaning citizens could not know which companies paid what amounts to which parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Concerns about it leading to a major financial scandal were raised seven years prior to the video's creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Judicial Intervention and Revelations
The [[role_of_supreme_court_in_electoral_bonds_case|Supreme Court]] declared the scheme unconstitutional after seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This decision has gradually revealed the scams that occurred during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Debunking Misinformation
Home Minister Amit Shah claimed at the India Today conclave that total bonds sold were worth ₹200 billion, with BJP receiving only ₹60 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, Election Commission of India (ECI) data shows the total bonds encashed between April 2019 and January 2024 were ₹127 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Out of this, the BJP received approximately ₹60 billion, which is about 47.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Distribution of Donations
The top recipients of Electoral Bonds (April 2019 - January 2024) were:
*   BJP: ₹60 billion (47.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
*   Trinamool Congress: ₹16 billion (12.6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Congress: ₹14 billion (11.1%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   BRS: ₹12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   BJD: ₹7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
*   DMK: ₹6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   YSR Congress Party: ₹3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   TDP: ₹2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
*   Shiv Sena: ₹1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
Other parties like RJD, AAP, JDS, SKM, and NCP received between ₹300 million to ₹700 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

While political donations are not inherently a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, it becomes fraudulent if contracts are awarded in return for donations, if public tax money is used to pay companies, or if companies not donating are harassed by agencies like ED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The core issue is the creation of a vast extortion racket that shattered the principles of [[preservation_of_democracy_and_challenges_to_electoral_integrity_in_India|democracy]] and stole public funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## How Electoral Bonds Worked
Electoral bonds functioned like coupons bought from banks, given to political parties, and then redeemed for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Unencashed bonds would see their money transferred to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund after 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### The Secret Alphanumeric Number
Initially, the government claimed the identity of bond buyers would remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. However, a journalist named Poonam Agarwal, working for The Quint, discovered through forensic testing that each bond had a secret Unique Alphanumeric Number visible under ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The Finance Ministry later acknowledged these secret numbers, claiming they were only a security feature and not for tracking donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Government's Access to Information
Retired Navy Officer Lokesh Batra's RTI and HuffPost India's review of records revealed that SBI had to record serial numbers for audit trails and to prevent forgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. A January 2018 notification (Section 6(4)) stated that SBI must provide electoral bond details to any law enforcement agency upon request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This implied that agencies like ED or CBI could easily ascertain which company donated which bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

This meant:
1.  The public was kept unaware of donor identities and donation amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
2.  Opposition parties did not know which companies donated to the BJP or how much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
3.  The BJP government had full access to information about all donating companies, making it a secret weapon against the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Unearthing the Scam
The Supreme Court declared the scheme unconstitutional on February 15, based on a petition filed by CPI(M), Common Cause, and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), with Advocate Prashant Bhushan arguing on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

The Supreme Court highlighted two significant points:
1.  Citizens have the right to know the quantum and source of donations to political parties, and the Electoral Bond Scheme violated this right to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
2.  The scheme was used for kickbacks, with contributions classified as pure business transactions where companies donated for benefits in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### SBI's Data Release
The Court directed SBI to release the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. SBI initially tried to delay, claiming it would take three months to collate data, but the Court refused leniency, leading to data release within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The data was published on the ECI website in two lists: one for bond buyers and values, and another for parties that encashed them and amounts received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. However, SBI slyly did not reveal the secret numbers, making it impossible to exactly connect the two lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The Supreme Court rebuked SBI again, directing full data publication by March 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Some political parties, including Samajwadi Party, Aam Aadmi Party, National Congress Party, JD(U), JD(S), DMK, AIADMK, JKNC, MGP (Goa), and SDF (Sikkim), voluntarily revealed their donor lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Four parties, CPI, CPI-M, All-India Forward Bloc, and CPI-ML, never accepted electoral bonds as a matter of principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Fraud
The fraud involved three entities: the ruling political party, large companies making donations, and the common public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The scam essentially involved diverting public funds (taxes) to companies, which then funneled money back to political parties via electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This is seen as robbing the poor to give to the rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Tax Evasion and Extortion
Companies that don't pay taxes properly reduce public funds, affecting government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Instead of raiding such companies, the government allegedly struck deals: political donations in exchange for a free pass on tax evasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This is termed extortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

*   Three of the top five donor companies—Future Gaming, Megha Engineering, and Vedanta—were raided by ED and the Income Tax Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   The Quint's analysis found that 14 out of the top 30 donors had been raided by agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### Compromised Public Projects
Public funds are meant to be spent cautiously, with contracts awarded based on strict criteria like experience, past performance, technical capability, and financial position to ensure quality and fair pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

*   **Navayuga Engineering Company Limited**: This company, which received the contract for the collapsed Uttarakhand tunnel where 41 workers were trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, bought electoral bonds worth ₹550 million between 2019 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Ranjit Buildcon**: Responsible for a flyover collapse in Ahmedabad in December 2021 (its third such incident), this company was found to have compromised on construction quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Despite this, it was awarded multiple projects by Gujarat's civic bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. It bought electoral bonds worth ₹90 million between January and July 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **BG Shirke Construction Private Limited**: This Pune-based company purchased electoral bonds for ₹1.18 billion between January 2023 and January 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. An FIR was registered against it in June 2022 for causing de@th by negligence due to an elevator crash at a housing project, killing four people. Another incident in October 2018 saw four people die from falling off a tower crane at its construction site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

### Case Study: Megha Engineering
Megha Engineering purchased electoral bonds totaling ₹9.66 billion between 2019 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Along with associated companies (Western UP Power Transmission Company Limited, SEPC Power, and Evey Trans Private Limited), their combined bond purchases exceeded ₹12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

*   **Kaleshwaram Multipurpose Irrigation Project (Telangana)**: Inaugurated in June 2019, its estimated cost ballooned from ₹810 billion to over ₹14.7 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. A February 2024 CAG report revealed Megha Engineering was overpaid ₹51.80 billion for four packages, including pump and equipment supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Other contractors (L&T, Navayuga Engineering) also received extended undue benefits totaling at least ₹75 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. The government reportedly rushed to award 17 projects worth ₹250 billion before detailed project reports were received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The National Green Tribunal also flagged the project's environmental clearance as illegal in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   **Zojila Tunnel**: In August 2020, Megha Engineering, a "small company from Hyderabad," won this ₹45 billion contract connecting Srinagar and Leh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Thane-Borivali Twin Tunnel**: In April 2023, Megha Engineering purchased ₹1.4 billion in electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. The following month, May 2023, it was awarded this ₹144 billion project by Mumbai's MMRDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   The Income Tax Department raided Megha Engineering in October 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, but after that, it purchased billions in bonds and received numerous projects from both the Telangana state government and Modi's central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. In June 2023, the Defence Ministry awarded it a ₹5 billion project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

## Other Cases
Other notable cases mentioned include:
*   Future Gaming, a lottery company, which was raided by central agencies while Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was meeting its owner's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   Beef exporting companies that bought Electoral Bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   Mining giants Vedanta, EMIL, GHCL, and MSPL, accused of bending environmental rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   Qwik Supply Chain, with directors linked to Reliance, which bought electoral bonds worth more than its net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

The National Testing Agency (NTA) is an autonomous body established in November 2017 under the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Its formation was intended to ensure greater independence and transparency in conducting examinations, thereby increasing public confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. However, recent events have led to widespread anger and accusations against the NTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

## Role in NEET Examination

The NTA is responsible for conducting the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Undergraduates (NEET-UG), which is the sole undergraduate admission exam for all medical, dental, and AYUSH courses in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This exam replaced the All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT) and various state-level exams, being fully implemented in 2016 after initial protests from several states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Prior to 2019, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) oversaw the NEET exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Pre-Exam Irregularities

Issues with the NEET 2024 exam began even before its conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>:
*   **Extended Registration Deadlines:** The registration opened on February 9, 2024, with a deadline of March 9. This deadline was extended by one week, then the registration link was reopened on April 9-10 at the request of "stakeholders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Correction Window:** A correction window was granted from April 11 to April 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** The identity of the "stakeholders" who requested the reopening of the registration link remains undisclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

## Allegations of [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_Indian_exams | Paper Leaks and Misconduct]]

Even after the exam was conducted on May 5, reports of [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_Indian_exams | paper leaks]] emerged from various states like Gujarat, Bihar, and Odisha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Patna Arrests:** Police in Patna arrested 13 individuals for leaking exam papers, allegedly charging students between ₹3 million and ₹5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Gujarat Racket:** A racket was busted in Gujarat involving an education consultancy owner, a school teacher, and a BJP leader, who were reportedly charging students ₹1 million for assistance in the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Widespread Problem:** An investigation by the Indian Express revealed 41 [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_Indian_exams | paper leaks]] in the last five years, impacting approximately 14 million job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Post-Result Controversies in [[NEET_2024_exam_irregularities_and_fraud | NEET 2024 Exam]]

The declaration of the NEET 2024 results on June 4 sparked significant controversy and accusations of a "large-scale scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Unprecedented Perfect Scores:** 67 students achieved a perfect score of 720 out of 720, all receiving All India Rank 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This is highly unusual, as only 2 students scored perfectly in 2023, and 3 in 2021, with none in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **NTA's Explanations and Criticisms:**
    *   **"Easy Exam":** NTA claimed the exam was "very easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, but students and experts had predicted it would be tough with lower average scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Increased Candidates:** NTA cited a higher number of candidates (300,000 more than 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Grace Marks:** The most contentious explanation was that 50 of the 67 toppers received grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.
        *   **Answer Key Discrepancies:** 44 students received grace marks due to discrepancies in answer keys, particularly a physics question with two correct answers based on different NCERT textbook editions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Critics question how a national exam can have flawed questions and why an outdated textbook edition (2018 NCERT) was considered valid when newer editions had corrected the error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
        *   **Time Loss Issues:** 6 students received grace marks due to "time-related issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. This led to impossible scores like 718 or 719, as the scoring system only allows for +4 or -1 marks, making these scores mathematically unachievable under normal circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. Two students with these scores were from the same Jhajjar Centre as other toppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
            *   NTA justified these grace marks by citing a 2018 Supreme Court judgment related to the CLAT exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. However, this judgment explicitly states it cannot be used for engineering and medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. Questions have been raised about the formula used and why the exam time wasn't simply extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
*   **OMR Sheet Discrepancies:** The Junior Doctors' Network of the Indian Medical Association highlighted that many students received vastly different marks on their final scorecards compared to their OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. Examples include an 80-mark difference for one student and a 10-mark difference for another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.
*   **Early Result Declaration:** The results were declared 10 days earlier than expected, coinciding with the 2024 General Election results on June 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. This timing led to accusations of attempting to "cover up a scam amidst the ruckus of the elections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

## Responses and Accountability

The Supreme Court has directed the NTA to provide answers, stating that "The sanctity of the exam has been affected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, Sanjay Singh, Akhilesh Yadav, and MK Stalin, have demanded an investigation and promised to raise the issue in Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. Over 40,000 students have signed a petition demanding a re-examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

On June 8, under increasing pressure, NTA announced that the Education Ministry would establish a four-member panel to examine the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. Later, the NTA agreed to remove the grace marks, offering the 1,563 affected candidates the option to either retake the exam or accept their scores without the grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

Despite these measures, the NTA maintains that the "integrity" of the exam has not been compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. Critics, however, point to the recurring issues of [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_Indian_exams | paper leaks]] and irregularities in Indian exams, questioning the [[role_of_Indian_government_and_education_ministry_in_exam_management | government's]] commitment to the future of the country's education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. The focus has also turned to the [[role_of_Indian_government_and_education_ministry_in_exam_management | Education Minister]], Dharmendra Pradhan, for accountability regarding the state of education in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. These [[effects_of_exam_fraud_on_students_and_education_system | exam fraud and irregularities]] have significant [[effects_of_exam_fraud_on_students_and_education_system | impacts on students]], with reports of depression and suicides linked to the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

India launched Operation Sindoor in response to a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, for which Pakistan's terror group TRF claimed responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. TRF is identified as a shadow group of the terrorist organization Lashkar Taiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Operation Sindoor Details

Operation Sindoor involved attacks on nine different terrorist sites within Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. India's military strategy emphasized precision and the avoidance of civilian casualties:
*   Targets were selected based on credible intelligence inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   The aim was to prevent damage to civilian infrastructure and loss of civilian lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   Nine terrorist camps were successfully targeted and destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   The attacks were described as "very precise and restrained," with no intent to cause harm to civilians or military sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   Operations were carried out at night to ensure no civilians were nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   The targeted locations were recognized as terror sites not only by Indian authorities but also by the international intelligence community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

India maintains that it is a status quo power focused on growing its economy, improving high technology, and providing a future for its young people, desiring to be left alone by Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Targeted Terrorist Sites
Key locations targeted during Operation Sindoor included:
*   **Markaz Taiba in Muridke**: Headquarters of Hafiz Saeed, designated a terrorist by the United Nations in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The U.S. placed a $1 million bounty on him in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This site is considered the "nerve centre" of Lashkar Taiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Markaz Subhan Allah**: Base of Masood Azhar, who was included in the UN's terrorist list in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This is the headquarters of his terrorist organization, Jaish-e-Mohammed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Sadna Bilal Camp of Muzaffarabad**: Where recruits of Lashkar and Jaish are trained by Pakistan's Special Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Sawai Nala Camp of Muzaffarabad**: Where the terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack were trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Other Sites**: The remaining five sites were described as initial induction centers, indoctrination centers, and training camps, all used for preparing terrorist attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Pakistan's Response and Alleged State Sponsorship

Following Operation Sindoor, Pakistan reportedly retaliated by shelling civilian villages along the Line of Control (LoC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Unprovoked firing from Pakistan was observed on the LoC, with Indian civilian houses bombarded with mortars and shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In Pooch, near the border, at least 16 people were killed (including civilians) and 59 injured, with 44 being civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. One tragic incident involved a shell falling on a car, killing two innocent children, aged 14 and 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

This response, according to India, further proves that the Pakistan government and military support terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The argument is made that a military that attacks innocent civilians and children should be called terrorist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Pakistan's Denial and International Scrutiny
Pakistan has a history of denying its involvement or support for terrorist organizations:
*   Initially denied any role in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, only to admit it later when a terrorist was caught alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Denied knowing about Osama bin Laden, who was later found in a military camp near a Pakistan Army base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif admitted that Pakistan had been involved in "dirty work" for America, the West, and Britain for three decades by backing, supporting, training, and funding terrorist organizations, calling it a "mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Former Prime Minister Imran Khan also acknowledged that jihadist outfits existed and operated for decades due to the US-led Afghan war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. However, both denied the current existence or activity of such groups like Lashkar Taiba, which was claimed to be "extinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an organization monitoring global money laundering and terror financing, has placed Pakistan on its increased monitoring grey list three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Although Pakistan was removed from the FATF grey list in October 2022 after promising action on 34 items related to terrorist financing and money laundering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, subsequent reports indicate continued terrorist activity:
*   Satellite images show Jaish-e-Mohammed's base in Bahawalpur doubled in size by 2022-2023, spreading over 18 acres, with construction speeding up after removal from the FATF grey list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   A Jaish-e-Mohammed gathering for recruitment and fundraising was held at the Osman O Ali campus in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   Satellite photos from Planet Labs show Jaish-e-Mohammed has two open hideouts in Bahawalpur (Markaz Subhan Allah and Usman o Ali Mosque), which are indoctrination and training centers for terrorists, with one complex located just 8km from a Pakistani military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   Jaish-e-Mohammed acquired 4 acres of new land in Bahawalpur in 2022, sold by a local official to Abdul Rauf, Masood Azar's brother, who was designated a terrorist by America in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Abdul Rauf has been seen leading funeral prayers for killed terrorists, with Pakistani military personnel and Pakistan flags on coffins, suggesting state funerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   A Jaish-e-Mohammed children’s magazine, *Muslim Bacche*, encouraged children in madrassas to support jihad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Questions have also been raised about the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approving a loan package of $2.3 billion for Pakistan, given these circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

### Lashkar Taiba's Narco-Trafficking
The Indian Government agency NIA reported to the Supreme Court that Lashkar Taiba engages in narco-trafficking as a strategy to weaken India by selling drugs to its youth and using the proceeds for terror activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   In 2021, over 2900 kg of heroin worth ₹21,000 crores was seized at Mundra Port, believed to be part of Lashkar Taiba's network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   Similar consignments were brought to India from Afghanistan, with drugs stored in Delhi warehouses and sales proceeds routed to Lashkar Taiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   A witness in the 2021 drug seizure case, a retired customs official, was found dead under mysterious circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   The NIA stated that a narco-trafficker in Afghanistan, with the help of Pakistan's ISI and Iranian middlemen, sent heroin from Afghanistan to Iran, then imported it to India hidden as tack powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Lashkar Taiba was formed in 1986 during Zia ul Haq's Islamisation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The UN Security Council attributes numerous terror operations to this organization, including the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, 2006 Mumbai local train blasts, and the 26/11 Mumbai attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Lashkar terrorist David Headley revealed he coordinated with Pakistani intelligence officers for the 2008 Mumbai attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Lashkar-e-Taiba's charity wing, Jamaat Dawa, is considered indistinguishable from the main group by the U.S., Australia, and the UN, and both have been banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Despite a ban by Pakistan in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, reports suggest it remains active and aligns with the Pakistani security establishment's nationalist Islamist agenda, even being used to fight the Islamic State in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

## Impact on Pakistan

The continued support for terrorist organizations has had severe consequences for Pakistan itself:
*   The Global Peace Index 2024 ranked Pakistan at 1140 out of 1163 countries, indicating extreme insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   The Centre for Research and Security Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank, reported that 2024 was the deadliest year for Pakistan Security Forces in a decade, with 40% more attacks than the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   Out of 905 incidents, 444 were Islamist terrorist attacks, killing 685 soldiers and police officers, and 927 civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   Pakistan's internal instability is also evident in political turmoil, with no Prime Minister completing a 5-year term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, and incidents like stampedes for free food and flour distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

This situation is attributed to "power-hungry politicians" who engage in conflict with India as an excuse to become dictators, neglecting the constitution and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. The prevailing religious fanaticism in politics is highlighted as a root cause of ongoing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

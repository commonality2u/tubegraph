OceanGate, a private company founded in 2009 by aerospace engineer Stockton Rush, specialized in taking wealthy individuals on deep-sea expeditions as a form of adventure tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. These tours were notably expensive, with each person spending over â‚¹20 million for a few hours of an expedition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## OceanGate's Fleet and Expeditions
OceanGate offered tours of various shipwrecks and deep-sea areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In July 2021, the company began offering tours to the wreck of the [[safety_measures_and_failures_on_the_titanic | Titanic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, which lies approximately 3,810 meters (12,500 feet) below the surface of the water in the Atlantic Ocean near Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

The company operated several submersibles, including:
*   **Antipodes**: Capable of reaching depths of up to 304 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Cyclops**: Designed for depths up to 500 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Titan**: The only submersible designed to descend to 4,000 meters, making it suitable for [[safety_measures_and_failures_on_the_titanic | Titanic]] expeditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

The Titan submersible, unlike a self-sufficient submarine, required a support ship, the *Polar Prince*, to launch and recover it, as well as to control surface operations and communications via a text messaging system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. OceanGate indicated they used Starlink's satellite internet service for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Titan Submersible Design
The Titan submersible was designed to carry five people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Its main body, or hull, was constructed from carbon fibre, with two titanium caps attached at the ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. It measured approximately 6.7 meters in length and weighed over 10,400 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The submersible featured four electric thrusters for operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

One notable design aspect was the size of its viewport (window), which was the largest installed in any private submersible at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Additionally, the Titan was controlled by a video game controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, a method also used by the US Navy for some submarine controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Inside the submersible, there were no seats, and a small toilet was located beside the viewport without a privacy barrier, requiring others to turn away when it was in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Crucially, the submersible's hatch could only be locked and opened from the outside using 17 bolts, meaning occupants could not exit independently, even on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Safety Concerns and Stockton Rush's Stance
OceanGate's operations and the design of the Titan submersible faced significant criticism and warnings regarding safety, particularly from its CEO, Stockton Rush.

### Disregard for Safety Regulations
Stockton Rush openly expressed his views on safety standards and [[government_regulatory_failures | regulations]].
*   In a 2019 interview, he stated that the "US Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 was needlessly prioritizing passenger safety over commercial innovation," implying he felt safety was overly emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   In a 2022 interview, Rush further articulated his perspective:
    > "At some point, safety just is pure waste. I mean, if you just want to be safe, don't get out of bed, don't get in your car, don't do anything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>
    > "I've broken some rules to make Titan. I think I've broken them with logic and good engineering behind me, the carbon fibre and titanium." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>
Rush intentionally disregarded rules that advised against using carbon fibre and titanium for such deep-sea vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, acknowledging that he was conducting a potentially dangerous experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

### Internal and External Warnings
Concerns about Titan's safety were raised internally and externally well before the implosion:
*   **David Lochridge, OceanGate's Director of Marine Operations**: In January 2018, Lochridge raised safety concerns about the Titan and, when ignored, went to court, stating that the company refused a necessary safety assessment and certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. He claimed OceanGate was unwilling to spend on safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   **Industry Leaders and Experts**: On March 27, 2018, 36 industry leaders, deep-sea explorers, and oceanographers wrote a letter to Stockton Rush. They warned that OceanGate's "experimental approach" and lack of quality checks could lead to a "terrible accident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **Deep-Sea Exploration Specialist**: In March 2018, another specialist emailed Rush, urging a more conservative approach to safety and warning that Rush was "putting himself and his clients in danger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### Material Choice and Implosion
The Titan's hull was made of carbon fibre, an "experimental design" that had not been tested for its properties at extreme ocean depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This contrasts with typical submarines and submersibles, which are usually constructed from steel, titanium, or aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Ocean explorer Robert Ballard, who discovered the [[safety_measures_and_failures_on_the_titanic | Titanic]] wreck in 1985, stated that carbon fibre is unsuitable for this use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. James Cameron, director of "Titanic," also criticized the design, noting that the titanium caps remained intact while the carbon fibre body was scattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

The eventual "catastrophic implosion" of the Titan was attributed to the high pressure at depth, which is almost 400 times the surface pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This implosion, an inward collapse, occurred instantaneously, resulting in the immediate death of all five occupants without them feeling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

### Parallels to the Titanic
Critics accused Stockton Rush of echoing the same "unsinkable" belief that was associated with the [[safety_measures_and_failures_on_the_titanic | Titanic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. The tragic outcome of the Titan expedition underscored the importance of never ignoring safety standards and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

The landscape of human spaceflight has evolved to include private companies, primarily through NASA's Commercial Crew Program. This initiative aims to collaborate with private entities to transport astronauts to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:33">[07:47:33]</a>.

## The Commercial Crew Program

NASA launched its Commercial Crew Program in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:33">[07:47:33]</a>. In 2014, out of many bidders, [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | SpaceX]] and [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Boeing]] were selected to participate in this program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:55">[07:54:55]</a>. Both companies were contracted to develop spacecraft capable of carrying humans to Earth's orbit and docking with the International Space Station (ISS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:12">[06:23:12]</a>.

The contracts awarded in 2014 had differing values:
*   [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | SpaceX's]] contract was approximately $2.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:21">[16:01:21]</a>.
*   [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Boeing's]] contract was worth $4.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:19">[16:04:19]</a>.

## SpaceX's Early Success

[[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | SpaceX]] successfully launched its first Crew-1 flight in November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:19">[08:04:19]</a>. This mission was a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:05">[08:07:05]</a>. [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | SpaceX]], with its Crew Dragon spacecraft, became the world's first private company to develop and fly a human orbital spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>.

## Boeing's Starliner: A Troubled Journey

[[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Boeing]], a company also known for manufacturing airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, developed the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:02">[06:12:02]</a>. This spacecraft is still in its developing stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

### The Boeing Crew Flight Test Mission (June 2024)

On June 5, 2024, at 10:52 AM, a [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Starliner]] spacecraft was launched in America, carrying two experienced NASA astronauts, Commander Barry E. Wilmore and Pilot Sunita Williams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This mission, named the Boeing Crew Flight Test, was intended as the final test step for the [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Starliner's]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

The spacecraft successfully docked with the International Space Station (ISS) after 27 hours on June 6, 2024, at 1:34 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. This successful docking made [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Boeing]] the world's second private company to build and fly a human orbital spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. Previously, only [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | SpaceX]] had achieved this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:20">[01:24:20]</a>.

### Unforeseen Problems

Despite the initial success, the mission quickly encountered significant issues:
*   **Helium Leaks:** Hours before the launch, engineers were managing a helium leak caused by a defective seal in the propulsion system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:02">[11:03:02]</a>. Helium is crucial for firing the spacecraft's thrusters, which are used for docking and undocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:04">[11:10:04]</a>. After launch, two more leaks were discovered, followed by a fourth when the [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Starliner]] reached the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:04">[11:47:04]</a>.
*   **Thruster Malfunctions:** Hours before docking, 5 out of 28 thrusters on the [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Starliner]] were not working properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. Commander Barry Wilmore had to manually control the spacecraft, resetting and refiring the thrusters with ground engineers' help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. Four of the five non-working thrusters eventually began functioning again, allowing for successful docking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:04">[12:34:04]</a>. Later tests revealed these thrusters were overheating due to direct sunlight exposure on the capsule's manual control system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

These issues led to concerns about the spacecraft's reliability for returning the astronauts to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:02">[12:54:02]</a>.

### Astronauts Stranded and the Path Forward

The mission was initially planned for only 8 days, but the astronauts remain stuck in space as of three months later, with NASA indicating they might stay for 8 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>.
*   **Safety on the ISS:** Despite being "stuck," the astronauts are not in danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. The ISS is over 350 feet long, with living and working space larger than a 6-bedroom house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. It has ample food, water, clothing, and oxygen supplies, along with recycling systems for oxygen and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. NASA sent a shipment of personal belongings for the astronauts on August 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   **Return Plan:** Due to the unresolved issues, it was decided that the [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Starliner]] would return to Earth without the astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. NASA has planned to bring Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore back to Earth using [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | SpaceX's]] Crew Dragon spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. In February 2025, [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | SpaceX's]] Crew-9 mission will send only two astronauts instead of four, allowing the stranded astronauts to return with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. This means the astronauts will spend approximately 9 months in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. NASA prioritized safety in this decision, mindful of past incidents like the 2003 [[NASA Space Shuttle Program | Challenger disaster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.

### Previous Starliner Test Failures

The recent mission's problems are not isolated incidents for the [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Starliner]]:
*   **Orbital Flight Test (December 2019):** The first uncrewed test mission was aborted after two days, failing to dock with the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. The primary cause was a computer system miscalibration that prevented the thrusters from firing on time, preventing the spacecraft from reaching the correct orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.
*   **Boeing Orbital Flight Test 2 (May 2022):** This uncrewed test was successful in reaching the ISS, but it also experienced glitches, including some thrusters not operating properlyâ€”the same issue seen in the 2024 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

## A Broader Context of Challenges for Boeing

[[Challenges faced by Boeing in aerospace | Boeing's problems]] are not limited to its space division. As an airline company, [[Challenges faced by Boeing in aerospace | Boeing]] has faced significant criticism in recent years due to issues with its 737 MAX commercial airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. These include:
*   A door breaking off a 737 MAX of Alaska Airlines in January 2024, caused by loose hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>.
*   Crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 (2018) and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (2019), both linked to a problematic software installed by [[Challenges faced by Boeing in aerospace | Boeing]] that took control away from pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.
*   These incidents led to all [[Challenges faced by Boeing in aerospace | Boeing]] 737 MAX planes being grounded for 20 months until December 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.

These ongoing issues across both its aerospace and commercial airline divisions highlight significant systemic problems for [[Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues | Boeing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

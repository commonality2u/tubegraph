## Pre-Election Predictions and Concerns
The Indian general elections concluded with results pending the following day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. In March 2024, News18's opinion poll predicted the BJP-led NDA would secure 411 seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, while India TV's CNX opinion poll forecasted 399 seats for the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Some exit polls also suggested the NDA would win more than 400 seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Prime Minister Modi initiated his election campaign with the slogan of winning over 400 seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Concerns arose when several BJP leaders, including Jyoti Mirdha, Anant Kumar Hegde, Arun Govil, and Lallu Singh, made statements hinting at the BJP's intention to change the Indian Constitution if they achieved a supermajority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Such changes would require a majority in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The BJP later refuted these statements after the election campaign had begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Catalysts for Public Discourse
The speaker expressed long-standing worries about India, the world's largest democracy, potentially transitioning into a dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A pivotal moment occurred in February with the [[election_fraud_and_irregularities_in_india | Chandigarh election fraud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. A presiding officer was caught committing voter fraud on CCTV footage, an unprecedented event in the country's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The Supreme Court described this incident as a "murder of democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This event served as a "trigger point," amidst other ongoing issues such as [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | media bias]], the overthrow of elected governments, and the "horse-trading" of MLAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

This led the speaker to create a video titled "Is India becoming a dictatorship?", which garnered 25 million views, indicating shared public concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Following this, two more significant incidents occurred: the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal and the freezing of the Congress party's bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The speaker highlighted concerns about the alleged liquor scam case, noting that Kejriwal was jailed based on the allegations of a man whose companies had donated millions to BJP through [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The freezing of Congress's accounts was seen as an attempt to cripple their election campaign over a minor mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Campaign for [[preservation_of_democracy_and_challenges_to_electoral_integrity_in_india | Democracy]]
Recognizing the widespread [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | media bias]] and misinformation, the speaker felt compelled to raise awareness, despite the challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The speaker drew inspiration from the Bhagavad Gita's emphasis on duty without attachment to results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, and historical figures like Bhagat Singh, who sacrificed himself for independence without guarantee of immediate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, and August Landmesser, who resisted openly against a totalitarian regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This motivated the speaker to speak up for India's [[preservation_of_democracy_and_challenges_to_electoral_integrity_in_india | democracy]] and Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, considering the sacrifices of [[political_events_leading_to_indian_independence | freedom fighters]] like Bhagat Singh, Subhash Chandra Bose, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

The speaker's "Mission 100 Crore" initiative aimed to reach a significant portion of voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Videos released reached approximately 7% of eligible voters through one YouTube channel alone (70 million unique viewers in 90 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, and an estimated 20-25% of voters across various platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Over 80% of the audience was from India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Opposition and Support
The speaker faced intense backlash, including personal insults, accusations of being anti-national, Chinese-funded, or Pakistani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. There were organized attempts to defame the speaker, including a leaked video of BJP members planning strategies to stop the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. These strategies included spreading fake news, even using deepfake audio to imitate the speaker's voice and fabricate conversations about illicit payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Newspapers like Dainik Jagran also spread unverified claims of Chinese funding against the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the speaker received significant public support, including thousands of messages, paintings, songs, and recognition in international newspapers like France 24, The Economist, Al Jazeera, and Time Magazine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Many individuals, including Bollywood celebrities and Indians living abroad, were motivated to vote or actively share information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The speaker noted the collective effort in highlighting real issues such as unemployment, farmer issues, the [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bond scam]], and the pharma scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

## Post-Election Vision and Continued Effort
Regardless of the 2024 election outcome, the speaker stated the commitment to continue the struggle for [[preservation_of_democracy_and_challenges_to_electoral_integrity_in_india | democracy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. If the BJP wins 350-400 seats and the country moves towards dictatorship, the efforts will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Even if the INDIA Alliance forms the government, the movement will not end, as there will still be scope for improvement in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. The speaker emphasized the need to address issues like the scarcity of honest politicians, agriculture problems, unemployment, and pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

The speaker called for every citizen to contribute to the nation's improvement by:
*   Overcoming communal, casteist, misogynist, and classist thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   Promoting "Vocals for Local" by buying directly from farmers and local businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   Practicing environmental responsibility by reducing plastic use, avoiding littering, and planting trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   Voting in every election and demanding [[preservation_of_democracy_and_challenges_to_electoral_integrity_in_india | free and fair electoral processes]], despite reported problems in the 2024 election regarding polling efficiency and adherence to the Model Code of Conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
*   Fulfilling professional duties with honesty and integrity, from teachers to IAS officers, police, filmmakers, and restaurant owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

The speaker concluded by highlighting the significant contributions of women journalists and influencers in the movement, who have helped challenge stereotypes and encourage women to engage in national issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The message is to remain vigilant and committed to making India a better place for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

Aviation safety is paramount in the airline industry, with numerous procedures and regulations in place to ensure passenger and crew well-being. These measures have evolved significantly, often in response to major incidents like the [[Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident | Aloha Airlines Flight 243]] in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Routine Safety Measures

Even on routine flights, specific safety protocols are followed. For example, during the [[Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident | Aloha Airlines Flight 243]], the seatbelt sign remained on until the plane reached its cruising altitude of 24,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This simple measure proved crucial, as passengers wearing seatbelts in affected rows were not ejected from the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

Aircraft cabins are continuously pressurized to allow passengers to breathe normally at high altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. In the event of a loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks are designed to drop, providing 15-20 minutes of oxygen for passengers while pilots descend to a breathable altitude below 10,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Aircraft Maintenance and Design

Aircraft undergo constant cycles of expansion and contraction during flight and on the ground due to cabin pressurization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This process can lead to [[airplane_structural_fatigue_and_corrosion | fatigue and corrosion]] in the fuselage, the main body of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

Boeing 737 aircraft, for instance, are constructed with aluminum sheet metal panels joined by overlapping "Lap Joints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Initially, Boeing used a strong epoxy glue to bond these panels and distribute stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Additionally, three rows of rivets secured the overlapping parts of every sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

However, problems arose with the epoxy glue, which degraded in high moisture, leading to metal corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This shifted the stress onto the rivets, causing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. By 1972, Boeing switched to a new method called Hot Bonding, which uses heat and pressure to join sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Aircraft are designed with safety features such as "Tear Straps" placed at regular intervals to prevent tears in the fuselage from spreading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Regulatory Oversight and Enforcement

The [[Investigation of airplane accidents | National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)]] is responsible for investigating incidents to determine their causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. In the case of Flight 243, the NTSB identified several contributing factors:

*   **Airline Management Failure** Aloha Airlines' management did not adequately supervise its maintenance program or assess inspections and quality controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Lapses** The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was partially blamed for not mandating thorough inspections of specific joints, despite Boeing's recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. The FAA had advised Aloha Airlines to use the [[Investigation of airplane accidents | Eddy Currents technique]] to detect cracks, but the airline was found to have lied about implementing this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Design and Ageing Aircraft** Both Boeing and the FAA were criticized for taking issues with the older bonding technique too lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Boeing's 737 was designed for a 20-year lifespan, or 75,000 flight cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. However, the short-distance nature of Aloha Airlines flights meant planes accumulated cycles faster; Flight 243 had nearly 90,000 cycles, exceeding the recommended limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Post-Incident Safety Improvements

The [[Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident | Aloha Airlines Flight 243]] proved to be a pivotal event that forever changed aviation safety standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Key outcomes included:

*   **Mandatory Inspections** All older Boeing aircraft underwent re-inspection, revealing widespread similar cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Stricter Regulations** Global safety regulations became much stricter to prevent similar accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.
*   **Aging Aircraft Programs** In 1991, the FAA launched its [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | Aging Aircraft Safety Program]], mandating inspections and control programs for all older aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Advanced Detection Methods** Aircraft maintenance techniques for crack detection improved significantly. Methods like [[Investigation of airplane accidents | Eddy Current]] and ultrasonic testing, which do not rely on human observation, are now routinely used to detect microscopic cracks early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **High-Cycle Plane Rules** New rules were introduced for "high-cycle planes" — those used for frequent short trips, completing many flights per day — requiring more frequent inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Legislative Action** The American government passed the [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | Aviation Safety Research Act in 1988]] to better understand and plan for issues related to aging aircraft structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

These comprehensive changes have fortunately led to a significant reduction in similar incidents since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

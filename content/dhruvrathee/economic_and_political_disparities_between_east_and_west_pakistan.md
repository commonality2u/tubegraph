After the devastating [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | Partition of India]] in 1947, the country of Pakistan was divided into two regions: West Pakistan and East Pakistan, separated by 1,500 km of Indian territory [05:38:00]. The [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | Partition]] was based on religious lines, largely ignoring existing social, commercial, and cultural relationships [03:17:00].

## Initial Hopes and Disappointment
Muslims in Bengal, who favoured Pakistan, hoped that a new Muslim country would provide them with a better standard of living and improved financial and social conditions [03:56:00]. Many felt inferior to Hindu landlords and expected fundamental rights from the Pakistani government [04:07:00]. However, these hopes were largely unmet, leading to significant disillusionment.

## Political Imbalance and Military Rule
Despite Bengalis forming the majority ethnic group, comprising more than half of the newly formed Pakistan's population [05:49:00], powerful positions in bureaucracy, military, and politics were concentrated in West Pakistan, specifically in the hands of Mohajirs and Punjabis [06:07:00].

Pakistan initially started as a Parliamentary Democracy, but power became concentrated in the hands of one person, preventing the establishment of a robust democracy [06:26:00].

Key political developments and power shifts:
*   **1946 Elections** The results of elections held in undivided India determined how legislatures would be divided after the separation [06:41:00].
*   **Governors-General and Prime Ministers** [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah|Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] became the first Governor General of Pakistan in 1947, followed by Nazimuddin in 1948 after Jinnah's death [06:53:00]. Liaquat Ali Khan was Prime Minister until his assassination in 1951, after which Nazimuddin became Prime Minister [07:03:00].
*   **Military Coups** The first military coup occurred in 1953 when Governor General Ghulam Muhammad dismissed Prime Minister Nazimuddin [07:17:00].
*   **1954 Elections** Elections saw the United Front (a collation of opposition parties), including the Awami League from East Bengal, win most seats [07:26:00]. However, Ghulam Muhammad dismissed the entire constituent assembly following these results [07:40:00].
*   **East Pakistan Renamed** In 1955, Major General Iskandar Mirza became Governor General, and under his tenure, East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan [07:48:00].
*   **Continued Military Rule** Between 1947 and 1971, Pakistan experienced multiple phases of military rule, which forcefully removed power from deserving political parties [08:00:00]. People in East Bengal were particularly denied political representation [08:14:00].

## Economic Disparities
The economic expenditure of the country disproportionately benefited West Pakistan [08:20:00]:
*   **National Budget** 75% of the national budget was spent on West Pakistan [08:24:00].
*   **Revenue Contribution** 62% of the government's revenue income came from East Pakistan [08:29:00].
*   **Per Capita Income** By 1969-70, the per capita income in West Pakistan was 61% higher than in East Pakistan [08:39:00].
*   **Military Presence** West Pakistan had 25 times more military personnel stationed than East Pakistan [08:46:00].

This economic disparity created deep resentment in East Pakistan.

## [[influence_of_language_imposition_and_cultural_differences_leading_to_bangladeshs_independence | Language Imposition and Cultural Differences]]
A major point of contention was language. [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah|Jinnah]] and his advisors believed that East and West Pakistan could only be unified through a single language: Urdu [08:53:00]. This led to the imposition of Urdu for official and military purposes [09:03:00].

However, the majority (56%) of Pakistanis spoke Bangla, and in East Pakistan, Bangla was the common language, while Urdu was seen as the language of the elite [09:15:00].

*   **Jinnah's Declaration** On March 21, 1948, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah|Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] unequivocally declared in Dhaka that Urdu would be the sole state language of Pakistan [09:33:00].
*   **Bengali Language Movement** This declaration caused outrage in Bengal, leading to the Bengali Language Movement [09:52:00].
*   **Protests and Violence** A major protest on February 21, 1952, saw Pakistani army open-fire on students and activists, killing five people [10:00:00]. This day is now celebrated as Language Martyr's Day in Bangladesh and recognized as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO [10:16:00].
*   **Official Recognition** Bangla was given official status in 1954 and became a state language in 1956 [10:30:00]. However, these events strengthened the resolve of the Bengali people regarding their culture and language [10:39:00].

## Consequences: The Path to Liberation
The disparities intensified after the 1965 India-Pakistan War, which left East Pakistan with weak defenses [10:48:00].

*   **Six-Point Demand** Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a leader of the Awami League, presented a six-point demand for the [[historical_context_of_language_and_economic_discrimination_in_bangladesh | economic development]] and greater autonomy of East Pakistan [11:02:00]. These demands included turning Pakistan into a Federation State, granting East Pakistan more autonomy over its resources, establishing separate currencies and independent foreign reserves for East and West Pakistan, and even a separate military force [11:18:00].
*   **Rejection and Arrests** West Pakistan's government rejected these demands as "separatist" [11:49:00]. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 34 other Bengali civil and military officers were arrested in 1968 under sedition charges in what became known as the Agartala Conspiracy Case, accused of collaborating with India to create an independent Bangladesh [12:05:00].
*   **Mass Protests** Mujibur Rahman's arrest sparked widespread protests. The killing of Sergeant Zahurul Haq, an imprisoned associate, by a prison guard further fueled public fury [12:54:00].
*   **Ayub Khan's Resignation** Facing worsening conditions, General Ayub Khan released Mujibur Rahman in February 1969, but the protests and strikes forced his resignation later that year [13:13:00]. He appointed General Yahya Khan as his successor, who promised general elections [13:47:00].
*   **1970 General Elections** The 1970 elections saw East Pakistan's Awami League win a shocking 167 out of 313 seats, securing almost every seat in East Pakistan but none in West Pakistan [14:01:00]. Conversely, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won 86 seats in West Pakistan but none in East Pakistan [14:39:00]. These results highlighted the deep divide between the two parts of Pakistan [14:48:00].
*   **Cancellation of Results** The political elites in West Pakistan, unwilling to accept a government led by a party with no seats in their region, sought to cancel the election results [15:03:00]. General Yahya Khan announced the cancellation on March 1, 1971 [15:31:00].
*   **Call for Independence** This cancellation ignited massive protests in East Pakistan, now calling for complete freedom [15:41:00]. People no longer saw Islam as a unifying factor, prioritizing their Bengali ethnicity and seeking a secular, democratic, socialist state named Bangladesh (country of the Bengali people) [16:09:00].
*   **Non-Cooperation Movement** On March 7, 1971, the Awami League launched a Non-Cooperation Movement against West Pakistan's government [16:32:00]. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a historic speech, declaring: "People in Bengal want freedom. People in Bengal want to live. People in Bengal want their fundamental rights" [16:54:00].
*   **Rising Tensions** Tensions escalated between Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis, who were seen as pro-West Pakistan [17:19:00]. Pakistani army used attacks on Bihari communities as an excuse to intervene [17:46:00].
*   **Operation Searchlight** On March 25, 1971, the West Pakistani government launched "Operation Searchlight," a brutal genocide targeting popular figures demanding independence [19:36:00]. Thousands of Pakistani troops marched into Dhaka, arresting Sheikh Mujibur Rahman [19:51:00].
*   **Declaration of Independence** Before his arrest, Mujibur Rahman declared East Pakistan an independent country, Bangladesh [19:59:00]. This declaration, though transmitted slightly past midnight, cemented March 26 as Bangladesh's Independence Day [20:11:00]. Major Ziaur Rahman publicly read this declaration on March 27, 1971 [20:24:00].
*   **Atrocities** During Operation Searchlight, 7,000 students were murdered in Dhaka dormitories in one night [20:34:00], and over 30,000 Bengalis were massacred within a week [20:43:00]. Intellectuals, teachers, scholars, and social activists (Budhhijivi) were specifically targeted and murdered [19:14:00].
*   **International Awareness** The genocide was exposed to the world through an article by Anthony Mascarenhas in the Sunday Times on June 13, 1971 [21:00:00]. This motivated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to take action [21:18:00].
*   **Exile Government and Refugee Crisis** Awami League leaders fled to India, forming the People's Republic of Bangladesh government in exile in Kolkata on April 10, 1971, with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as President and Tajuddin Ahmad as Prime Minister [21:24:00]. The conflict led to over 10 million refugees crossing into India by autumn 1971 [21:45:00].
*   **India's Involvement** India's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi directed General Sam Manekshaw to prepare for war on April 28, 1971 [22:10:00]. India began training the Mukti Bahini, the independent Bengali nationalist army [18:38:00].
*   **1971 India-Pakistan War** On December 3, 1971, Pakistan launched "Operation Chengiz Khan," attacking Indian airfields [22:56:00]. This preemptive strike, intended to prevent Indian interference, failed [23:06:00]. India responded with a defensive strategy in West Pakistan and an offensive thrust in East Pakistan [23:26:00].
*   **UN Intervention and Veto** Pakistan appealed to the UN for a cease-fire [23:36:00]. The US, China, and UK supported an immediate cease-fire and troop recall, but the Soviet Union, favoring India, vetoed the resolution twice [23:49:00]. The UK and France later abstained due to the atrocities against Bengalis [24:07:00].
*   **Bangladesh Recognized** Bhutan was the first to recognize Bangladesh on December 6, 1971, followed by India on the same day [24:15:00].
*   **Pakistan's Surrender** By December 12, Pakistan was facing defeat [24:25:00]. On December 16, 1971, the Indian Army surrounded Dhaka, and Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi surrendered without resistance [25:15:00]. The historic Instrument of Surrender was signed, with over 93,000 Pakistani troops surrendering to Indian and Bangladesh Liberation forces, the largest surrender since World War II [25:36:00].

## Aftermath
*   **Simla Agreement (1972)** Pakistan recognized Bangladesh as an independent country under this agreement [25:54:00]. In return, India released 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war and returned 13,000 km² of occupied land in West Pakistan [26:07:00].
*   **UN Recognition** The United Nations recognized Bangladesh as an independent country in 1974 [26:35:00].
*   **Leadership Changes** Yahya Khan's dictatorship in Pakistan collapsed, and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became President [26:40:00]. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released and returned to Dhaka as a hero, winning the 1973 elections [26:51:00].
*   **New Challenges** While Bangladesh gained independence, it faced its own period of political instability. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a secular leader who banned religious political parties like Jamat-e-Islami, was assassinated with his family on August 15, 1975 [27:22:00]. General Ziaur Rahman seized power in a military coup in 1975, portraying the military as heroes and revoking the ban on Jamat-e-Islami, leading Bangladesh to remain a military dictatorship for several years [27:50:00]. Mujibur Rahman's daughter, Sheikh Hasina, later came to power in 2009 and is the current Prime Minister [28:13:00].

The story of Bangladesh's birth highlights the profound impact of [[influence_of_language_imposition_and_cultural_differences_leading_to_bangladeshs_independence | language imposition]] and [[historical_context_of_language_and_economic_discrimination_in_bangladesh | economic and political disparities]], suggesting that had Bengalis been treated equally, the outcome might have been different [28:38:00]. The vast geographical and cultural differences also made unity difficult [28:54:00].

The question of whether democracy still exists in India is a serious one, with a deeper meaning than simply the ability to vote regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While elections are held and people can vote for any political party they wish, leading to the party with the most votes coming into power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, there are significant concerns regarding the fairness and freeness of these elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Defining Free and Fair Elections

Merely having elections does not guarantee a country is a democracy, as evidenced by nations like North Korea and Russia, where elections are held but are far from free and fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. For an election to be truly democratic:
*   **Free**: People must have the freedom to vote for whom they choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Fair**: Different candidates and political parties must have a fair chance of winning, without one party having excessive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Concerns suggest that India might be moving towards a "One Nation, One Party" system, with the voice of the opposition being eradicated from the media, investigative agencies weaponized, and the right to protest suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Allegations of Electoral Malpractices

Several incidents have raised questions about the integrity of the electoral process in India:

### Chandigarh Municipal Corporation Mayor Elections
In the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation Mayor elections, an alliance of Congress and AAP had a clear majority of 20 out of 35 votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. However, the presiding officer declared 8 votes from the alliance as invalid, leading the BJP to claim victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This alleged election fraud was captured on CCTV footage, with the presiding officer seen looking at the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The Chief Justice of India called this a "murder of democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The Supreme Court later intervened to rectify the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) Concerns
*   **Assam, 2021**: An EVM machine was found in a BJP candidate's car in Assam, leading the Election Commission to order a repoll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Pune, February 2024**: Three unknown individuals attempted to steal the control unit of an electronic voting machine from the Saswad Tehsil office in Pune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Electoral Bonds Scheme
The use of electoral bonds was a method to hide political funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The Supreme Court recently struck down the Electoral Bonds Scheme, calling it unconstitutional and arbitrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Out of ₹160 billion in electoral bonds sold, over ₹100 billion went to BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. These amounts often surpass the Election Commission's spending limits for elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, making it difficult for social workers or individuals without significant funds to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## [[bias_and_control_of_indian_election_commission | Bias and Control of the Indian Election Commission]]

The [[bias_and_control_of_indian_election_commission | Election Commission]], expected to conduct free and fair elections, has faced accusations of partiality and bias for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Accusations of Partiality
*   Even before the May 2014 election, Narendra Modi himself accused the Election Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   Prashant Kishore stated that the Election Commission acts as an extension of BJP and is the most partial and biased commission he has seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. He alleged the Commission tries to bend rules and schedule elections to benefit BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Violation of Campaign Rules
Despite clear directions against mentioning the Indian Army during political campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>:
*   PM Modi openly asked for votes using martyrs and airstrikes before the 2019 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath referred to the Indian Army as "Modi's Army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Complaints regarding these violations received no action from the Election Commission for 21 days, after which a clean chit was given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. PM Modi received clean chits in at least four such cases, and Amit Shah also received clean chits for comparing Rahul Gandhi's constituency to Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Removal of Dissenting Commissioner
One of the three election commissioners, Ashok Lavasa, had a dissenting opinion in five out of seven cases where clean chits were given to Modi and Shah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Subsequently, his family members received notices from government agencies, and he was "silently removed" from the Election Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Appointment of Election Commissioners
To strengthen the independence of the Election Commission, the Supreme Court ordered that the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners be appointed by a three-member committee including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. However, the government introduced a new law that removed the Chief Justice of India from this committee, replacing him with a government minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This means two out of three members of the committee are from the government, allowing them to control appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Related Issues Affecting Electoral Integrity

Beyond direct fraud, other issues contribute to an uneven playing field in Indian elections, impacting [[electoral_integrity_and_challenges_in_ensuring_free_and_fair_elections | electoral integrity and challenges in ensuring free and fair elections]]:

### Horse-Trading of MLAs
There are numerous allegations against the BJP for "horse-trading," where MLAs are allegedly taken to resorts and bought with large sums of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Such practices suppress the voice of the people and strangle democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Weaponization of Investigative Agencies
The government is accused of weaponizing investigative agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against opposition leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   Fourteen political parties complained to the Supreme Court about over 3,000 raids conducted on political leaders, with 95% of cases registered against opposition parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   While ED claims a high conviction rate, it's based on a small number of trials (24 convictions out of over 5,900 cases registered since 2005), meaning only 0.5% of cases are substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   A pattern has emerged where corruption charges against opposition politicians often vanish once they join BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, a phenomenon dubbed "Washing Powder Modi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This includes cases against figures like Himanta Biswa Sharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   Opposition politicians are often jailed without conviction for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. AAP MP Raghav Chadda asserted that cases against opposition leaders like Manish Sisodia and Satyendra Jain would be dismissed if they joined BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   Investigations have also revealed that ED is used against companies that haven't donated to BJP, with a pattern emerging where companies donate millions after being raided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

### Interference in State Governments
The central government is accused of using governors to interfere in the day-to-day affairs of opposition-ruled states, preventing them from working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   States like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Kerala have reported governors delaying bills passed by state governments, sometimes for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The Supreme Court has stated that governors cannot delay bills and such actions are unconstitutional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   Despite a Supreme Court ruling in favor of the Delhi government's powers, the central government passed a new law (GNCTD Amendment Act, 2023) to transfer many powers to the Lieutenant Governor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | Media Bias and Misinformation]]
A fair election requires equal media coverage for ruling and opposition parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. However, the media is largely seen as singing praises for the government 24/7, with anchors acting as spokespersons for the ruling party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. NDTV, a channel known for questioning the government, was acquired by Gautam Adani, a friend of PM Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. The government also allegedly uses tax money to fund 'advertisements' on TV channels, which then work to suppress citizens' voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. This lack of unbiased information prevents citizens from making free and fair voting decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

### Suppression of Protests
The right to protest is a fundamental aspect of holding the government accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. However, protests, such as the recent farmers' protests, have been met with severe measures including sharp nails, dug-up roads, rubber bullets, and tear gas drones, resembling a war zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. This approach raises concerns about the government's willingness to allow citizens to exercise their democratic right to protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

The collective impact of these incidents raises serious questions about the [[preservation_of_democracy_and_challenges_to_electoral_integrity_in_india | preservation of democracy and challenges to electoral integrity in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. If the situation continues to deteriorate, India risks falling to the levels of countries like North Korea and Russia, where democracy exists only on paper, and elections are held but without true meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

The Baisaran Valley in Pahalgam, often referred to as India's mini Switzerland, was the site of a horrific terrorist attack that profoundly impacted the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Casualties and Victims
At least 26 people were killed in the attack, and 17 sustained injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. All 26 fatalities were male <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The victims were targeted based on their religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   One victim, Syed Adil Hussain Shah, was a local Muslim mule handler from Pahalgam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   One victim was Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   The remaining 24 victims were Hindus, who were tourists from various places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Notable victims include:
*   Neeraj Udhwani (32), an HR professional from Jaipur working in the UAE, who was on vacation in Kashmir with his wife after attending a wedding in Shimla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Sudeep Neupane, a victim from Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Indian Air Force Corporal Tage Hailyang from Arunachal Pradesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Manish Ranjan, a Section Officer at the Intelligence Bureau from Bihar, who was visiting Kashmir with his wife and two children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   Indian Navy Lieutenant Vinay Narwal (26) from Haryana, who was on his honeymoon, having been married just six days prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. His wife reported that a man shot him after saying he didn't look Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Asavari, an HR professional from Pune, witnessed terrorists asking her father to recite Islamic verses, and when he couldn't, they shot him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Rescue Efforts
Due to the high-altitude location, which is accessible only by hiking or mule, rescue operations required helicopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Locals used mules to transport the injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. At least 12 tourists admitted to Pahalgam Hospital were reported to be in stable condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The Indian army arrived about 20 minutes after the attack to rescue survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Perpetrators
The Resistance Front (TRF), a shadow group of the Pakistan-based terror organization Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. TRF was declared a terrorist organization by India's Ministry of Home Affairs under the UAPA framework two years prior, after threatening Kashmiri journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Sheikh Sajjad Gul, a member of this group, was also designated a terrorist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

An intelligence assessment suspects Lashkar-e-Taiba's top commander Saifullah Kasuri was a conspirator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Initial probes suggest 4-6 terrorists carried out the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. J&K police released sketches of three Pakistani attackers based on eyewitness statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Government sources indicated two Kashmiri youths, Adil Guri from Anantnag and Ahsan from Pulwama, who went to Pakistan in 2018, might have infiltrated India with Pakistani terrorists and were among the attackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Intelligence Failures and Government Accountability
A *Times of India* report by Raj Shekhar Jha cited a source stating there were prior inputs in early April about terrorists scoping out hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Despite having intelligence inputs, the attack still occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This incident drew parallels to the [[overview_of_the_911_attacks | Pulwama attack]] of February 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   In June 2019, then-Ministry of State for Home Affairs, G Kishan Reddy, stated there was no intelligence failure regarding Pulwama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   A *Frontline* investigation revealed 11 intelligence inputs between January 2 and February 13, 2019, warning of a 'Qisas' (revenge) attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   Intelligence inputs from January 24 and 25, 2019, specifically named Mudasir Ahmad Khan as planning a 'Fidayeen' attack and provided his location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. He was linked to the Shahid Baba Group, which included Pulwama bomber Adil Ahmad Dar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   A "Top Secret" input from February 12, 2019, warned of IED blasts on J&K security forces' routes, with a video demonstrating such blasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. A final warning followed on February 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Despite these warnings, over 2,500 soldiers were sent in a single convoy instead of being airlifted, an action criticized by the former IG of CRPF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that country's security is the responsibility of the elected government and questions the continued terrorist attacks despite Prime Minister Modi's 2016 claim that demonetisation had "broken the back of terrorism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. A list of significant attacks in Jammu and Kashmir since November 2016 is provided:
*   Nagrota Army Base attack (November 2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
*   Amarnath Yatra attack (July 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
*   Sunjuwan Military Station attack (February 2018) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   Pulwama attack (February 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   Jammu Bus Stand grenade blast (March 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>

*   Poonch Rajouri attack (2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>
*   Reasi attack (2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   Pahalgam attack (2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>

## Media Coverage and Army Shortages
The article criticizes the lack of media courage in questioning the government on these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. It recalls a time before 2014 when media and films (like *A Wednesday*) questioned the government on terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

It highlights the current shortage of army personnel, noting that the Defence Ministry reported 42,095 officers against an authorized strength of 50,538, and a deficit of 92,400 soldiers, totaling over 100,000 personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This shortage is attributed to no army recruitment during the two years of COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Further concern is raised by reports of plans to cut army strength by 200,000 over three years, seen as an attempt to reduce salary and pension expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

The sister of Vinay Narwal, a victim, stated that her brother was alive for 1.5 hours and could have been saved if the army had been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This contrasts with the Z-plus security given to billionaires like Mukesh Ambani, involving 55 personnel, including NSG commandos funded by taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Calls for Unity and Condemnation of Exploitation
Jammu and Kashmir's Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attackers as "animals and inhuman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. Kashmiris observed a shutdown and held candlelight marches as signs of mourning and unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Prominent Muslim organizations like Jamat-Ulama-e-Hind and the All India Imam Organisation condemned the attack, with Imam Umer Ahmed Ilyasi announcing a strong anti-terror message from 550,000 mosques during Friday prayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Muslim countries such as UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Qatar also condemned the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

The article urges citizens not to fight along religious lines to defeat terrorists' intentions, which are to spread religious hatred and break apart the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

However, the BJP Chhattisgarh's official social media handles posted an image with the caption "They asked for the religion not the caste," which was criticized for using the tragedy to spread religious hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The article suggests this post indicates a lack of intent to address caste discrimination and a continued agenda of spreading religious hatred, aligning with the terrorists' goal of creating [[communal_violence_and_false_flag_operations_in_india | civil war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

It cautions against "us versus them" propaganda, stating that violence, regardless of its basis (religion, caste, language), is detrimental to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It calls for the punishment of criminal and terror elements and for citizens to unite for peace and progress, reiterating the slogan "Long Live Indian Unity!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

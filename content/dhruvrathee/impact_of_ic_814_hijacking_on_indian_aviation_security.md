The [[ic_814_hijacking_incident_timeline | IC 814 hijacking incident]], which occurred on December 24, 1999, had a significant impact on [[security_issues_in_india | Indian aviation security]] measures, leading to reforms aimed at preventing future incidents.

## Aftermath and Immediate Changes

The [[ic_814_hijacking_incident_timeline | IC 814 hijacking]] was the largest and last plane hijacking in Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Fortunately, no other plane has been hijacked in India since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

The incident exposed severe security and communication failures within the Indian government and its agencies. For instance, Punjabâ€™s Director General of Police, Sarabjit Singh, was informed about the hijacking through TV news an hour after it began, rather than through official channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Similarly, top national leaders, including then Home Minister L.K. Advani, learned about the hijacking from news programs instead of the Crisis Management Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

Following the hijacking, a Crisis Management Group was formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. One of its local committees was tasked with delaying the plane as much as possible at Amritsar to allow commandos time to develop a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. However, this attempt failed due to a "historic blunder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> and a communication gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## Long-Term Impact

The failures during the [[ic_814_hijacking_incident_timeline | IC 814 hijacking]] led to widespread criticism of the incumbent government for its handling of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. The incident highlighted critical vulnerabilities, particularly the security breach at Kathmandu's airport, which is suspected to have involved Dawood Ibrahim's Nepal network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

Despite the initial blunders, the incident ultimately led to stricter regulations and processes in Indian aviation security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. These enhanced measures have made it "extremely difficult to hijack any plane" in India since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

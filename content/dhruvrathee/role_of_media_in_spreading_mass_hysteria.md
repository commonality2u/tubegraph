The [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | media]] played a significant part in the phenomenon of the Monkey-Man scare in Delhi in 2001, contributing to the spread of [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | mass hysteria]] among the public.

## Initial Reporting and Escalation
Local newspapers were the first to report on the Monkey-Man incidents on May 14, 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Following this, the number of reported cases of Monkey-Man attacks grew exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Mainstream newspapers and news channels, including popular ones like Star News and Aaj Tak, began extensively covering the story, making it the most covered topic for the next two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. This wide coverage amplified the fear among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

News channels deployed teams of reporters and cameramen to alleged Monkey-Man hotspots in Delhi, instructing them to remain outdoors with cameras on throughout the night in an attempt to capture an attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Although nothing was ever captured on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>, this intense media presence contributed to transforming public fear into widespread paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

## Sensationalism and Public Trust
According to doctors who investigated the Monkey-Man phenomenon, the Indian [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | media]] played a crucial role in spreading the "virus" of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. In 2001, new private news channels were emerging and competing for viewership, leading them to sensationalize news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

This era marked a shift from state-run DD News to private channels, and the public, being naive, largely believed everything reported as news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. People blindly trusted that if something, like the existence of the Monkey-Man, was shown on the news, it must be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

Some individuals even fabricated stories about seeing the Monkey-Man to the [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | media]], hoping for a chance to appear on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. The police also attributed the [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | mass hysteria]] to the [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | media]]'s coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.

## Decline of Media Interest
After a couple of weeks, the [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | media]] lost interest in the Monkey-Man story, leading to a decline in reported incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. This rapid spread and decline, described by doctors as characteristic of [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | mass hysteria]], contributed to the phenomenon's eventual disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.

## Other Examples
The impact of [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | media]] on [[mass_hysteria_and_psychological_phenomenon | mass hysteria]] is also evident in other cases:
*   **Spring-Heeled Jack (England, 1837-1904):** A similar phenomenon where people in London believed a man with red eyes and metal nails was attacking women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.
*   **Braid Chopping Incidents (India, 2017):** Women in Haryana and Delhi reported fainting and waking up to find their braids cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

In both instances, factors such as a less educated and superstitious populace, low socio-economic status, psychological and environmental stress, and the proliferation of rumors and [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | media]] played a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

The Ambani family, led by patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani, significantly influenced the trajectories of his sons, Mukesh and Anil Ambani, particularly through their differing relationships with the family and the strategic decisions made for business succession.

### Dhirubhai Ambani's Influence and Succession Planning

Dhirubhai Ambani, who began his career as a gas station attendant, rose to become one of India's biggest businessmen by the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:29">[02:28:29]</a>. After suffering a stroke in February 1986, which paralysed his right hand, he began transferring his businesses to his sons, Mukesh and Anil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Mukesh Ambani, an introvert, was tasked with handling operations, focusing on setting up mega-projects within time and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Anil Ambani, an extrovert, became the public face of Reliance, responsible for public relations, corporate affairs, lobbying, and government marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

In 1991, Dhirubhai appointed Mukesh as Vice Chairman of Reliance, while Anil remained Joint Managing Director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This was a clear indication that Dhirubhai preferred Mukesh to eventually lead Reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. As Mukesh took on more activities, he started placing his loyalists, like Anand Jain and Manoj Modi, in key positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

Towards the end of his life, observing the growing rift between his sons, Dhirubhai attempted to prevent a business division by orchestrating a mega-merger of Reliance companies in March 2002. He merged Reliance Petroleum with Reliance India Ltd., believing it would make the group impossible to divide, forcing the brothers to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. However, this strategy ultimately failed, and Dhirubhai passed away on July 6, 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

### Familial Dynamics: Wives and Mother

The differing personal choices of Mukesh and Anil significantly shaped their standing within the conservative Gujarati Ambani family, impacting their professional roles and future business prospects.

#### Anil Ambani and Tina Munim
Anil Ambani's decision to marry Tina Munim, a glamorous Bollywood celebrity and former Miss India, was met with strong family opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Tina's modern image and past live-in relationship with actor Rajesh Khanna were considered scandalous by the conservative Ambani family, who were unwilling to accept her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Dhirubhai Ambani actively opposed the marriage, even using his political influence to orchestrate an Enforcement Directorate (ED) raid on Tina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Despite this, Anil remained adamant, threatening to leave the family if Tina was not accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Family and friends intervened, leading to their marriage in February 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. However, Tina Munim remained an outsider within the family, especially compared to Mukesh's wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Further deepening Anil's frustration was the hiring of Sandeep Tandon, the IRS officer who had raided Tina's house, as a consultant at Reliance in 1994, reportedly with Mukesh's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

#### Mukesh Ambani and Neeta Dalal
In stark contrast, Mukesh Ambani married Neeta Dalal, a choice approved by his mother, Kokilaben, who spotted Neeta at a Bharat Natyam dance recital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Neeta Ambani was regarded as the "real daughter-in-law" and played an important role in family decisions, on which Dhirubhai and Kokilaben often depended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Her influence extended to business, as her role in Reliance Infocomm, handling advertising and branding, grew significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

### Post-Dhirubhai Era and the Influence of the Mother

Following Dhirubhai's death, Mukesh assumed control of Reliance, with Anil as the second-in-command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Anil Ambani initially desired his mother, Kokilaben, to become Reliance's Chairperson, but Mukesh refused, citing concerns about international investor perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

As the brothers' feud escalated into an open war, becoming public knowledge in late 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>, their mother, Kokilaben, played a crucial role in brokering a truce. Amidst increasing government pressure from figures like Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>, Kokilaben intervened to sort out the family differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. With the help of family friend K.V. Kamath, the Chairman of ICICI Bank, Mukesh agreed to a truce in June 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. This led to an agreement splitting the Reliance Group assets, with Mukesh receiving core businesses and Anil inheriting ventures requiring significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. This agreement also included a 10-year non-compete clause between the brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

Years later, when Anil Ambani faced the threat of imprisonment due to unpaid debts to Ericsson, Kokilaben again intervened, reportedly asking Mukesh to help his brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>. Mukesh ultimately paid the outstanding dues, preventing Anil from going to jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>. Despite this, Anil Ambani later stated in a London court that he had received "one-time-only" help from Mukesh and would not receive any more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the [the_ambani_brothers_feud_and_its_impact_on_their_empire | conflict between the Ambani brothers] not only affected their businesses but also influenced India's political and financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The story serves as a reminder that "money cannot replace your family" or "help control your ego and your pride" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>. Had the brothers worked together, their lives and the outcome for their businesses could have been vastly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a>.

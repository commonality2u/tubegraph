Area 51 is a highly classified United States Air Force facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range in the middle of a desert [03:51]. It is widely known for its association with [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | UFO conspiracy theories]], though its true purpose was long a secret military testing site [03:51, 09:01].

## The 1947 UFO Craze and the [[roswell_incident_analysis | Roswell Incident]]

In July 1947, a widespread "UFO craze" swept America, with people reporting sightings of "flying saucers" [00:02, 00:06]. This craze began on June 24 when private pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen nine shining UFOs near Seattle, flying at speeds of 2,000 km per hour [00:13, 00:17, 00:26, 00:28]. Within two weeks, similar sightings were reported across the country, leading to heavy media discussion [00:38, 00:40, 00:46]. Media linked these sightings to atomic sites, focusing on three areas with the most reports, which were sites of nuclear tests [00:51, 00:54, 00:58].

During this period, a New Mexico man named Mac Brazel recalled finding unusual debris on his field, consisting of tin foil, rubber, and a thin wooden beam [01:02, 01:07, 01:12]. Wondering if it was related to the UFO craze, he took the debris to the Roswell Sheriff on July 7 [01:17, 01:21]. This caught the attention of Colonel William Blanchard, the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Airfield (RAAF) [01:26, 01:31]. The next day, the RAAF released a statement confirming that "the rumours of the flying disks had come true" and that the 509th Bomb Group of the 8th Airforce had gained possession of a "disk" [01:34, 01:39, 01:44, 01:47, 01:51].

However, the very next day, US Army Officials retracted their statement, claiming the debris was merely from a weather balloon [01:55, 01:56, 01:59, 02:02]. Photos of Major Marcel with pieces of the weather balloon were released as proof [02:04, 02:08]. The news then died down, with the media and public assuming there was no UFO [02:12, 02:13, 02:17].

## Resurgence of [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Alien Conspiracy Theories]]

Years later, in the late 1970s, rumors re-emerged about an alien craft crashing in the New Mexico desert after being struck by lightning, killing its alien occupants [02:20, 02:23, 02:26, 02:30, 02:36]. In 1980, Major Marcel, who had been involved in the original Roswell incident, wrote a book titled "The Roswell Incident," claiming the debris he had seen was "from nothing made on this Earth" and didn't seem to be from this world [02:39, 02:42, 02:44, 02:46, 02:48].

Since then, the importance of the [[roswell_incident_analysis | Roswell Incident]] grew, leading to new theories [02:50, 02:54]. People claimed a living alien was discovered in the UFO crash and that the US Army kept it at a secret base, where it remains imprisoned [02:56, 02:59, 03:02, 03:06, 03:10]. These theories also posited that the US Army was attempting to reverse-engineer alien technology and research alien life at a top-secret location known as Area 51 [03:12, 03:17, 03:20].

## Area 51: A Restricted Military Facility

Area 51 is a US Military facility situated in the middle of a desert, miles away from the closest cities [03:51, 03:54, 03:56]. Trespassing or entering the facility is strictly prohibited, with signboards warning that photography is banned and suspicious activity would be met with "deadly force" [03:58, 04:02, 04:04, 04:07, 04:09, 04:12, 04:14].

The area is isolated, with a 250 km highway that lacks even a gas station, and summer temperatures often exceed 40°C [07:16, 07:19, 07:21, 07:24, 07:27, 07:31]. The nearest village, Rachel, had a population of only 54 people as of 2019 [07:34, 07:37, 07:40, 07:41, 07:44]. This isolation is due to Area 51 being located on the Nevada Test and Training Range, America's largest government-controlled land, spanning over 12,000 km² [07:45, 07:48, 07:53, 07:56, 08:00]. Adjacent to it is the Nevada Test Site, where the US conducted nuclear weapons tests from the 1950s to the 1990s [08:00, 08:04, 08:05, 08:08].

## Area 51's True History: Cold War Aircraft Development

Area 51 was actually established during the Cold War, a period of intense rivalry between America and the Soviet Union, as a testing and development facility for aircraft [08:24, 08:28, 08:41, 08:43, 08:47, 08:54]. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sought a secret location for a High-Altitude Reconnaissance Program [09:28, 09:32, 09:34, 09:37]. Two CIA officers were tasked with finding a site to develop spy planes for use against the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons [09:45, 09:48, 09:50, 09:52, 09:58].

Annie Jacobsen's book "Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base" claims that a secret base was found in the middle of a dried-up lake bed in Nevada, known as Groom Lake, which is now Area 51 [09:58, 10:01, 10:05, 10:07, 10:11, 10:13, 10:15, 10:17]. This was already a classified area where the government was testing nuclear weapons [10:18, 10:21, 10:26].

### Spy Aircraft Development

Area 51 was crucial for the development of two extraordinary spy aircraft:

*   **U-2 Spy Plane**: After the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in 1949, America needed a way to gather intelligence without satellites [10:36, 10:38, 10:40, 10:43, 10:47, 10:49]. In 1953, President Eisenhower launched Project Aquatone, a covert CIA program with a $22 million budget, to build an aircraft that could fly 4,800 km without refueling, carry 320 kg of cameras, and operate at an altitude of 21,000m, remaining undetected by radar and anti-aircraft missiles [10:51, 10:53, 10:54, 10:58, 11:01, 11:05, 11:08, 11:12, 11:16, 11:18]. This led to the U-2 spy plane, which enabled America to spy successfully on the Soviet Union for several years [11:18, 11:20, 11:25, 11:28]. However, on May 1, 1960, a U-2 aircraft piloted by Francis Gary Powers was shot down by a missile, forcing America to admit its spying activities [11:32, 11:34, 11:39, 11:41, 11:42, 11:44, 11:46, 11:50, 11:52, 11:54].
*   **Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird**: Following the U-2 incident, the military was pressured to develop a faster, more secretive plane that could not be shot down [11:56, 11:59, 12:03, 12:06]. This led to the creation of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, which remains the fastest-flying aircraft, with a maximum speed of 3,400 km per hour and the ability to fly at an altitude of 24,000m, making it virtually immune to being shot down [12:06, 12:10, 12:14, 12:18, 12:20, 12:25].

Given the critical nature of these military weapons and the ongoing Cold War, it was essential to keep their testing a secret [09:09, 09:13, 09:16, 12:25, 12:29, 12:32].

## CIA's Use of UFO Theories for Secrecy

The CIA intentionally used [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | UFO conspiracy theories]] as a cover [12:37, 12:39]. They allowed people to believe the unidentified aerial phenomena were alien flying saucers, neither denying nor confirming the claims [12:48, 12:51, 12:54, 12:57, 13:03, 13:05, 13:09, 13:13]. This tactic prevented the public from discovering that these were the US's top-secret military aircraft [13:13, 13:17].

This is believed to be the reason why the "flying saucer" theory from the [[roswell_incident_analysis | Roswell Incident]] was initially allowed to circulate in the media before the CIA retracted the statement [13:17, 13:21, 13:24, 13:37]. The government understood that admitting the existence of aliens and alien experiments would cause widespread fear and paranoia [13:24, 13:27, 13:31, 13:33, 13:34, 13:37].

The re-emergence of UFO rumors in the 1970s is attributed to the testing of the Blackbird SR-71 aircraft during that period [13:42, 13:45, 13:49]. Most UFO sightings, particularly of these unconventional-looking aircraft flying at high altitudes (like the U-2 at 21,000m and SR-71 at 24,000m or even 26,000m) around sunset, were mistaken for UFOs [16:37, 16:41, 16:45, 16:48, 16:51, 16:55, 17:00, 17:04, 17:06, 17:08, 17:10, 17:12, 17:14, 17:16, 17:18, 17:21]. Often, "UFOs" are military drones, decoy flares, or other unknown military air infrastructure [17:24, 17:26, 17:29, 17:30]. The term "UFO" simply means "Unidentified Flying Objects," not necessarily aliens [17:34, 17:38, 17:40, 17:44].

The US Airforce Project Blue Book investigated many UFO sightings, cross-checking reported times with flight records and eliminating the majority of UFO reports in the late 1950s and 1960s by matching them with known flights [17:53, 17:57, 18:00, 18:04, 18:06, 18:09].

## The "Storm Area 51" Event

In June 2019, Bob Lazar, a [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | cult figure]] who claims to have researched flying saucers and Area 51, appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast [04:19, 04:24, 04:26, 04:29, 04:32, 04:36, 04:39, 04:44]. Lazar claimed to have been a researcher at Area 51, tasked with reverse-engineering alien technology to improve modern technology [04:44, 04:49, 04:52, 04:56, 05:01, 05:06].

Inspired by this podcast, college student Matty Roberts created a Facebook event called "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All Of Us" [05:10, 05:15, 05:19, 05:21, 05:24, 05:27, 05:29, 05:31, 05:33, 05:37]. The prank event suggested people gather at Area 51 at 3 AM on September 20, 2019, to coordinate an infiltration [05:37, 05:42, 05:44, 05:46]. It included absurd suggestions, such as using a "Naruto Run" to dodge bullets [05:52, 05:55, 05:57, 06:00, 06:04, 06:05, 06:08, 06:11].

Despite its clear prank nature, over 2 million people confirmed their attendance by the end of August, alarming Matty Roberts [06:13, 06:15, 06:18, 06:19, 06:22, 06:26, 06:31, 06:33, 06:34, 06:37, 06:39, 06:42, 06:44]. He publicly stated he was not responsible [07:03].

Reaching Area 51 is difficult due to its isolated desert location with no infrastructure [07:04, 07:09, 07:12, 07:16, 07:19]. Although military personnel expected around 30,000 attendees, only about 6,000 actually showed up [14:48, 14:51, 14:55, 15:01, 15:11, 15:13, 15:17]. Most attendees came with tents and vehicles, turning the event into a music party called "Alienstock" [15:01, 15:05, 15:07, 15:17, 15:21, 15:23, 15:27]. The event was peaceful, with no attempts to enter Area 51 or property damage, but the increased police presence cost approximately $300,000 [15:35, 15:37, 15:39, 15:42, 15:44, 15:46, 15:49, 15:52].

## Debunking the Myths and Government Declassification

In 1994, the US Air Force revealed that the debris from the [[roswell_incident_analysis | Roswell Incident]] was from a nuclear surveillance balloon developed under Project Mogul [15:54, 15:56, 15:58, 16:01, 16:03, 16:06]. This project aimed to detect sound waves from Soviet nuclear weapons tests using balloons [16:09, 16:15, 16:19]. However, repeated government misstatements had eroded public trust, leading to continued skepticism even after the explanation [16:21, 16:23, 16:26, 16:29, 16:32, 16:34].

Claims made by Bob Lazar have also been debunked [14:17, 14:20, 14:24]. He fabricated his educational background, claiming a fake MIT degree and confidential government research as reasons for lacking official records [18:12, 18:14, 18:19, 18:23, 18:25, 18:30, 18:32, 18:34]. His claim that alien spacecraft were powered by Element 115, which could create its own gravity field, was disproven in 2003 when Russian scientists produced the element (named Moscovium) and found it did not create a gravity field [18:51, 18:57, 19:02, 19:05, 19:06, 19:08, 19:10, 19:12, 19:19, 19:21, 19:25, 19:28, 19:31].

The CIA publicly acknowledged Area 51 in June 2013, declassifying secret details of its history under the Freedom of Information Act [19:31, 19:33, 19:36, 19:41, 19:44, 19:47, 19:49, 19:54, 19:58, 20:01, 20:03]. This release confirmed Area 51's exact location in the Mojave Desert, Nevada [20:10, 20:15, 20:18, 20:21].

Further declassifications occurred in January 2017, when 13 million pages of CIA documents, including records of UFO sightings and CIA experiments, were released online [20:21, 20:23, 20:26, 20:28, 20:30, 20:34]. In January 2021, thousands more documents on UFOs were declassified, with the agency claiming all its UFO records were now public [20:34, 20:40, 21:01, 21:03].

## [[government_stance_on_ufos_and_uaps | Government Stance on UFOs and UAPs]]

Today, the US government avoids the term "UFO" due to its association with aliens, instead using "UAP" (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) [21:16, 21:19, 21:22, 21:26]. In December 2020, the US government directed the National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense to release all UAP records to the public [21:28, 21:33, 21:38, 21:42].

In April 2020, the US Pentagon released three videos, acknowledging that previously leaked videos from 2007 and 2017 were real [21:52, 21:55, 21:58, 22:01]. In August 2020, the Defense Department created a UAP Task Force to detect, analyze, and catalogue UAPs, recognizing them as a potential threat to national security [22:03, 22:07, 22:12, 22:15]. While many UAPs can be explained as weather balloons or other known phenomena, some lack sufficient data for identification [22:40, 22:43, 22:44, 22:46, 22:48, 22:50].

The current belief is that unidentified UFOs are likely part of highly classified programs being developed by government agencies of various countries [22:53, 22:55, 22:58]. Area 51 continues to be a site for testing next-generation aircraft [23:02, 23:05].

Area 51 has become a global sensation and a source of tourism for Nevada [23:09, 23:12, 23:14]. In 1996, Nevada even renamed the highway leading to it the "Extraterrestrial Highway," embracing the conspiracy theories for tourism [23:19, 23:22, 23:26, 23:31]. However, despite its tourist appeal, Area 51 remains an active military facility, and trespassing is prohibited, punishable by arrest [23:34, 23:36, 23:38, 23:41]. A Dutch YouTuber, Ties Granzier, was arrested and spent three days in jail for attempting to trespass [23:43, 23:46, 23:49, 23:52, 23:54, 23:57, 23:59, 24:00].

In July 1940, the political landscape of Europe was dominated by Germany under Adolf Hitler, who had occupied nearly all surrounding countries including Austria, Poland, Norway, Belgium, Denmark, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Hitler had also formed an alliance with Italy's dictator, Mussolini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. At this time, only three major countries remained independent in Europe: Germany, the Soviet Union, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. A peace agreement existed between Germany and the Soviet Union, meaning the Soviets were not a concern for Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Consequently, Britain stood as the sole European nation opposing Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Meanwhile, America chose to remain uninvolved in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Churchill's Defiance and Operation Sea Lion

Hitler initially believed that British Prime Minister Winston Churchill would seek a peace treaty, given the overwhelming strength of the German army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, Churchill defied expectations, delivering an iconic speech declaring, "We shall never SURRENDER!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This speech made it clear that the war against Germany would continue and that no peace treaty would be signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

In response, Hitler planned to invade the UK, codenaming the operation "Operation Sea Lion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. As there is no land connection between the UK and mainland Europe, a direct ground invasion was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Sending ships was also not viable due to the superior British Royal Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Thus, Hitler decided to establish control over British airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

On July 10, 1940, Hitler's German Air Force, the Luftwaffe, which boasted 2,600 aircrafts compared to the UK's 700, attacked Britain from the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The initial objective was to destroy British aircrafts, airfields, and manufacturing factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The smaller British Royal Air Force, one-fourth the size of the Luftwaffe, bravely defended their country but suffered heavy losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Escalation and the Battle of Britain Day

The Germans began attacking at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. On August 24, 1940, German pilots mistakenly bombed London, causing civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Shocked by this, Churchill ordered the UK to retaliate by bombing Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Witnessing his cities being bombed, Hitler, who had not previously been interested in bombing London, decided to destroy the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

On September 15, 1940, Hitler ordered an "all-out decisive attack" on London, deploying over 1,000 fighter jets to quickly overwhelm the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Specifically, 1,120 German aircrafts (620 fighters and 500 bombers) were deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The British Royal Air Force, with only 630 aircrafts, prepared for defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. A historical battle ensued in the sky, during which the British Royal Air Force successfully intercepted and crushed the German waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. They downed over 60 Luftwaffe aircrafts while losing only 29 of their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

This day is now known as Battle of Britain Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Significance and Aftermath

The British victory in the Battle of Britain, despite being outnumbered, stemmed from the profound difference in motivation between the two forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. For the defending country, it was a matter of existence, inspiring soldiers to fight with all their might to protect their homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This high motivation was a key factor in Ukraine's successful defense against Russia in the recent Russia-Ukraine War, despite Russia's larger and more technologically advanced army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The Battle of Britain Day marked one of Hitler's first major losses in [[reasons_for_hitlers_defeat_in_wwii | WWII]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Recognizing the low chance of success for Operation Sea Lion, Hitler postponed the invasion of the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. He then shifted his focus from Britain to the Soviet Union, which he considered a vital step for Germany to become the world's number one superpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. However, this decision to attack the Soviet Union proved to be a major mistake and a turning point in [[reasons_for_hitlers_defeat_in_wwii | WWII]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.# Battle of Britain and its Significance

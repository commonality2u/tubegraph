On February 1, 2003, NASA's [[columbia_space_shuttle_disaster | Columbia Space Shuttle]] was returning to Earth after a two-week mission in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This flight, the 28th for the Space Mission Columbia program, was considered routine for NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, it ended in a catastrophic disaster, claiming the lives of all seven astronauts on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## The Disaster Unfolds

At 8:44 AM, the space shuttle re-entered Earth's atmosphere, with systems initially appearing normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) Charlie Hobaugh was in communication with the shuttle, discussing tire pressure readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Mission Commander Rick Husband's response was abruptly cut off, with only the word "Roger" being heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Despite repeated attempts, communication could not be re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Unbeknownst to the NASA team on the ground, an explosion had occurred in the [[columbia_space_shuttle_disaster | Columbia Space Shuttle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. News reports soon began to show scenes of debris falling from the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Observers on the ground described seeing a blazing light, like a comet, breaking apart into multiple pieces and falling in Texas around 9:12 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. NASA quickly realized the severity of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### The Crew

The seven astronauts who perished were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:
*   Commander Rick Husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:09:57]</a>
*   Payload Commander Michael Anderson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   Pilots William McCool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon from the Israel Space Agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   Three Mission Specialists, including Kalpana Chawla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>

One of the astronauts was Kalpana Chawla, an Indian-born American and Mission Specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Her story became an inspiration, particularly in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

#### Kalpana Chawla's Journey

Born in Karnal, Haryana, India, on March 17, 1962, Kalpana Chawla's interest in space began after observing planes flying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Despite initial discouragement from her family and professors due to societal norms of the 1960s, she pursued Aeronautical Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. She completed her Bachelor's degree from Punjab Engineering College, followed by a Master's at the University of Texas, and a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Chawla began working at NASA's Ames Research Center in 1988, specializing in Fluid Dynamics Aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. She became an American citizen in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. In 1994, she was one of 20 out of 4,000 applicants selected for astronaut training by NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Her first space flight was in November 1997 on the Columbia program flight STS-87, where she served as Mission Specialist and operated the robotic arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. During this mission, a Spartan satellite went out of control, but it was later determined not to be her fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This made her the first Indian-origin woman and first South Asian-American woman to go to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### The STS Program and Columbia

The Space Transportation System (STS) was NASA's official space shuttle program, known for its focus on reusability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The program, which ran from 1981 to 2011, was the longest human space flight program in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. The main shuttles used were the Challenger and the [[columbia_space_shuttle_disaster | Columbia Space Shuttle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The Columbia, first launched in April 1981, had completed 27 successful missions before the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Reusability was not the cause of the disaster, as shuttles underwent extensive inspection and refurbishment after each flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Kalpana Chawla's final mission, STS-107, launched on January 16, 2003, after being delayed 13 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. For 16 days, the crew conducted around 80 experiments across various scientific fields, including microgravity, combustion, crystal growth, and prostate cancer research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. A notable finding was that the smell of flowers changes in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Interestingly, a live group of roundworms survived the disaster, protected in aluminum canisters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Investigation and Lessons from the Columbia Disaster

The astronauts were unaware of any issues until 8:58 AM on February 1, when Columbia's backup flight software indicated a loss of pressure in four wheels on the left side of the shuttle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This warning came just one minute before the signal was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### The Cause: Foam Strike and Negligence

The actual cause of the [[columbia_space_shuttle_disaster | Columbia disaster]] was a seemingly minor event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Eighty-one seconds after Columbia's launch, a small piece of foam (60 cm long, 40 cm wide, 750 grams) detached from the external tank and struck the left wing of the shuttle at an estimated speed of 700-900 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

After the incident, NASA engineers requested imagery to assess the damage, possibly using American spy satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. However, this request was refused by STS Program Manager Ron D. Dittemore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Dittemore later resigned in April 2003, acknowledging his mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The book *Comm Check* by Michael Cabbage and William Hardwood stated that the Department of Defense was willing to use spy cameras, but NASA officials declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

The foam strike created a small hole in the left wing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. As the shuttle descended through Earth's atmosphere, hot air began to leak through this hole, compromising the thermal protection system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. The hole rapidly enlarged, causing a significant portion of Columbia to be exposed to external fire and gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This led to sensor failures in the left wing, followed by tire pressure warnings, and ultimately, the disintegration of the spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

### The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB)

An internal commission, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), was formed to investigate the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. In August 2003, CAIB released a comprehensive report detailing the cause of the disaster and highlighting NASA's negligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. The report specifically mentioned the failure of William Readdy, NASA's human spaceflight chief, to accept the offer to use spy satellites to monitor the shuttle's damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This omission meant the damage was not investigated, and the mission proceeded as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

The CAIB report also noted that such foam strikes were common, having been observed in 65 out of 79 prior missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The issue with this particular foam strike was that it "hit the wrong place at the wrong time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

### Crew Survival Investigation Report

In December 2008, the *Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report* was published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This report found that the astronauts passed away within seconds due to the disruption of cabin pressure, not from heat or damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. It confirmed that even with better equipment, the violent disintegration of the crew module and exposure to hypersonic conditions would have been unsurvivable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>:

> "The breakup of the crew module and the crew's subsequent exposure to hypersonic entry conditions was not survivable by any currently existing capability." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>

### Post-Disaster Changes and Legacy

Following the disaster, NASA halted the space shuttle program for 2.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Crucially, the design of the foam ramp was changed to prevent similar incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. This change has successfully prevented a recurrence of such a disaster for over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

The STS program continued until July 2011, having carried out 135 missions over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Over its three-decade run, 14 astronauts tragically lost their lives in accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

NASA has paid numerous tributes to the [[columbia_space_shuttle_disaster | Columbia]] crew. The landing site of NASA's Mars rover was named Columbia Memorial Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. Additionally, asteroids between Mars and Jupiter were named after the crew members, including "51826 Kalpana Chawla" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

Kalpana Chawla's passion for science education led her to arrange for students from her secondary school in Karnal, Tagore Bal Niketan Senior Secondary School, to participate in NASA's Summer Space Experience Program since 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Each year, two girls from the school were sent to Houston for the Foundation for International Space Education's United Space School, and Kalpana Chawla would invite them to her home for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

The Great Pyramid of Giza, built approximately 4,500 years ago in Egypt, stands as an enduring wonder of the world that continues to fascinate people today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Standing 147 meters tall, it remained the tallest structure globally for over 4,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Constructed using heavy stones, its estimated weight is 6 million tonnes, significantly more than the present-day tallest structure, the [[construction_history_of_burj_khalifa | Burj Khalifa]], which weighs about 500,000 tonnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its construction is particularly puzzling given the lack of modern technology, such as cranes, bulldozers, or even wheels, at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Historical Context and Site Overview

The Great Pyramid is considered one of the most enigmatic structures on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It is estimated to have been built around 2560 BC by Pharaoh Khufu, who was the second monarch of the fourth dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. His reign is a subject of debate among historians, with estimates ranging from 23 to over 60 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Located on the west bank of the River Nile, the Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu) is not isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The site also includes the Pyramid of Khafre, built by Khufu’s son and the second-largest pyramid in Egypt, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, said to have been built by Khafre’s son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Alongside these, the complex features the Great Sphinx, several burial tombs, and smaller pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Out of an estimated 118 pyramids of various shapes and sizes across Egypt, these three are among the most well-preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Purpose of the Pyramids

The primary reason for building these monumental structures was as tombs for the Pharaohs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. [[ancient_egyptian_beliefs_about_the_afterlife_and_tombs | Ancient Egyptians believed in the afterlife]], where the soul would travel to the underworld and be judged by the Gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. To prepare for this, Pharaohs commissioned tombs during their reigns, intending to be buried with food, treasures, jewelry, furniture, and clothes for use in the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. After death, their bodies were mummified and sealed in sarcophagi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

This understanding of the pyramids' purpose is supported by:
*   Scripts discovered on other pyramids and sarcophagi that detail ancient Egyptian customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   The use of a majority of historical pyramids in Egypt and Sudan as tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

While the Great Pyramid of Giza itself yielded no substantial evidence upon archaeological entry, only finding three relics and an empty sarcophagus believed to be Khufu's, historians generally agree that it was built as a tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. It's theorized that its contents were looted before archaeologists arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | Alternative and Conspiracy Theories About the Pyramids]]

The lack of direct evidence for the Great Pyramid's contents has led to various [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | alternative theories]].

*   **Power Plant Theory**: One popular theory suggests the Great Pyramid was a power plant capable of generating electricity, claiming ancient Egyptians were technologically advanced enough to harness electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Artwork from ancient Egyptian temples is sometimes presented as evidence of them building light bulbs, though this artwork actually depicts Egyptian mythological stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Such theories are often "cooked up" due to a lack of substantial evidence and frequently lack logical sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Granary Theory**: Another theory, proposed by American politician Ben Carson in 1998, posited that the pyramid was a granary for storing crops, suggesting it was built by "Jesus Christ's father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This highlights how some theories arise from political or religious motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Alien Construction**: Some individuals claim the pyramids were built by aliens, believing it was impossible for humans to achieve such a feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Historians widely agree that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built as a tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The belief was that a grander tomb with more treasures would ensure a better afterlife for the Pharaoh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## [[theories_and_methods_about_how_pyramids_were_built | Theories and Methods of Construction]]

The construction of the Great Pyramid, a 147m tall structure made of enormous rocks weighing 2.5 to 80 tonnes each, remains the most mysterious aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Each stone was meticulously carved and stacked without modern tools or even wheels, all within an estimated period of 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Labor

A common misconception, often portrayed in films, is that slaves built the pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This idea was first suggested by Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th century BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. However, modern [[archaeological_evidence and historical interpretations of pyramids | archaeological evidence and historical interpretations of pyramids]] indicate this is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The workers were highly skilled laborers who were well-fed—better than the average Egyptian citizen of that era—and not abused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. They lived in cities near the construction site and were supported by various communities, including farmers who helped during their off-seasons, uniting the kingdom for a national project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. An estimated 20,000-30,000 workers were involved, working 10 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Materials

The construction used approximately 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite, and 500,000 tonnes of mortar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Most materials were sourced locally, with some granite coming from as far as Southern Egypt, about 800 km away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Stone Cutting

Copper tools were primarily used for cutting softer rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Harder rocks like granite were broken using dolerite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. A unique method involved finding cracks in rocks, inserting water-soaked wooden wedges, and allowing the expansion of the wood to break the rock apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Stone Transport

Since wheeled vehicles were not used (wheels primarily existed for pottery at that time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, a plausible theory suggests that stones were moved from quarries using rafts on the Nile River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Once at the pyramid site, they were transported using sledges pulled over wet ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This theory is supported by a 2014 study based on a painting from the tomb of Djehutihotep (c. 1900 BC), which shows 170 people pulling a statue on a sledge while a man pours water on the sand in front of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Physicist Daniel Bonn and his team later confirmed that adding 2-5% water to sand significantly reduces friction, making it easier to pull heavy objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Stone Stacking and Lifting

Two main theories propose how the stones were lifted:

*   **Ramps**: An efficient system of ramps was likely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. In 2015, a 4,500-year-old wooden ramp was discovered in a quarry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Scholars suggest a straight slope from the ground to the top could have been used, with wooden pillars on the sides of the slopes for ropes to pull stones up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. To maintain a manageable angle, a long slope would have been built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Levers**: Another theory suggests the use of levers to stack stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This would involve using a higher middle point and a long pole with weight on one side to lift, turn, and place stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. A similar mechanism, known as a "Shadoof," was used in Egypt for millennia to draw water from the Nile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Construction Time and Mortar

While these [[theories_and_methods_about_how_pyramids_were_built | theories]] are fascinating, they face inconsistencies with the estimated 20-year construction time, which would require placing a stone every 3 minutes, every day, all year round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This speed seems unlikely, leaving the exact method a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

The bottom layers of the pyramid were placed without mortar, while upper layers incorporated mortar to increase stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This contributed to the pyramid's ability to withstand thousands of years and multiple earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The chemistry of the mortar is known, but scientists have been unable to recreate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

The outermost layer of the pyramid was made of fine, whitish limestone, causing the structure to shine brilliantly in the sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This outer casing has largely worn off the Pyramids of Khufu and Menkaure, but a part remains visible at the top of the Pyramid of Khafre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## Design and Alignment

The design of the pyramids is notably precise, with the directions pointing almost exactly towards North, East, South, and West, with an error of merely one-fifteenth of a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This accuracy is remarkable given the absence of compasses or modern GPS technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

Researchers have proposed [[theories_and_methods_about_how_pyramids_were_built | theoretical explanations]] for this precision:

*   **Autumn Equinox Theory**: Egyptians may have aligned the pyramids by observing shadows during the Autumn Equinox, when day and night are equal and shadows point directly East and West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. The degree of error in the pyramid's alignment matches the error found in shadows during the Autumn Equinox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Constellation Theory**: This theory suggests that the stars in the sky were used for alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

### Orion Correlation Theory

In 1989, author and Egyptology enthusiast Robert Bauval proposed the [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | Orion Correlation Theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. He claimed that the three pyramids at Giza were aligned similarly to the three stars of Orion's Belt, suggesting intentional astronomical knowledge by the ancient Egyptians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

However, historians consider this a "Fringe Theory" for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>:
*   The three pyramids were not planned or built simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   Astronomical tests in 1999 showed that the pyramids do not align exactly with Orion's Belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   The constellation's position has shifted over thousands of years, meaning its alignment in ancient times would differ from today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

The Orion Correlation Theory is cited as a classic example of humans seeking patterns where none exist, often due to a lack of concrete evidence or exact explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Such exaggerations can lead to bizarre [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | theories]], such as the claim that aliens built the pyramids because humans couldn't have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Scientific thinking, in contrast, prioritizes acknowledging known facts and clearly identifying what remains unknown, leaving room for future research by archaeologists and historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

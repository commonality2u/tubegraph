On 8th March 2014, Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, carrying 227 passengers, 10 flight attendants, and 2 pilots, departed Kuala Lumpur at 12:42 in the morning, bound for Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The flight was under the command of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a 53-year-old highly experienced senior captain, and First Officer Fariq Hamid, 27, for whom it was a training flight before full certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

The flight proceeded normally for about 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. At 01:08 AM, it crossed the Malaysian coastline over the South China Sea, heading towards Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Captain Zaharie confirmed the plane was at 35,000 feet and everything was normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Approximately 11 minutes later, as the aircraft entered Vietnamese Air Traffic jurisdiction, Kuala Lumpur Air Traffic Control instructed MH370 to contact Ho Chi Minh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Captain Zaharie's response, "Good night. MAS 370," were the last words received from the airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. After this, the Malaysian Airlines flight suddenly [[disappearance_of_malaysian_airlines_flight_mh370 | disappeared]], becoming the world's biggest aviation mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The Vanishing Act and Initial Search

Just 30 seconds after entering Vietnamese airspace, at 01:21 AM, MH370 vanished from civilian radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. While Kuala Lumpur Air Traffic Control initially assumed the plane had simply moved out of their range and into Vietnamese airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, Vietnam's Air Traffic Control reported the plane disappearing from their radar after entering their airspace and attempts to communicate received no response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It took 18 minutes of repeated attempts before Vietnamese controllers informed Kuala Lumpur of the plane's sudden [[disappearance_of_malaysian_airlines_flight_mh370 | disappearance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. An emergency response, typically initiated within an hour, only began after four hours had passed, at 06:32 AM, the plane's scheduled landing time in Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

An immediate [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search operation]] began in the South China Sea, involving 34 ships and 28 aircraft from seven different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, no trace of the plane was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### New Data and the "7th Arc"

Four days later, on March 12, it was revealed that military radar had spotted the plane last at 02:22 AM, not over the South China Sea, but near the Andaman and Nicobar islands, westward from Malaysia above the Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This indicated the plane was flying North, away from Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Further evidence emerged from satellite data, showing the plane automatically communicating with a satellite, a common occurrence for large aircraft like the Boeing 777 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While no location data was transmitted, investigators used the angle of the satellite's antenna when it received these "Satellite Handshakes" to approximate the plane's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. MH370 attempted to establish communication with the satellite seven times, generating seven large circles representing possible locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The last of these circles was massive, covering areas from Kazakhstan and China to Indonesia and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. By calculating the plane's speed and remaining fuel, investigators narrowed down the potential crash site to a shaded arc of this last circle, famously dubbed the "7th Arc," located 2,000 km west of Australia in an largely unexplored part of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Extensive deep ocean [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search operations]], the largest and most expensive conducted to date, were carried out based on this data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. After three years and $160 million spent, the operation was called off in 2017, deemed a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, in July 2015, the first piece of debris, a flaperon, was found on Réunion Island, east of Madagascar, confirming the plane had crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In 2018, an American company, Ocean Infinity, conducted a new search on a "no find, no fee" basis, using advanced underwater surveillance vehicles to map the ocean floor, but also failed to locate the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Theories Behind the Disappearance

Investigations into the backgrounds of passengers and pilots led to several theories about what happened to MH370 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The sudden disappearance from radar suggested either an electrical or technical failure, an accident, or manual deactivation of the transponder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Pilot Action Theory

One prominent theory accused Captain Zaharie Shah of intentionally disabling communication and crashing the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Speculation suggested he might have been in a suicidal mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Arguments supporting this theory included:
*   The plane making a nearly 180° turn back towards Malaysia from Vietnam, an action believed to be manual and intentional, not by autopilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   The plane reportedly flying directly along the border between Thailand and Malaysia, possibly to avoid both countries' airspace radars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   The discovery that Captain Zaharie had a flight simulator at home, on which he had mapped out a flight path coincidentally similar to MH370's actual deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

However, the official in charge of the search operation denied this theory, citing counter-arguments:
*   Zaharie was a highly experienced and respected pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   He had no known family or economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   There was no past behavior to suggest he would doubt his integrity or commit such an act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Hijacking/Terrorism Theory

A second theory proposed that hijackers or terrorists were responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Two Iranian passengers traveling with stolen passports were initially suspected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. One had a passport stolen from an Italian man, and the other from an Austrian man, both stolen in Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. It was suggested they intended to use the stolen passports to settle in Europe via Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This theory was eventually rejected, as investigations revealed no evidence of terrorist intent beyond their use of fake passports for immigration purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Interpol also confirmed they were likely not terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### Oxygen Deficiency / Technical Malfunction Theory

Considered the most probable theory, it suggests that everyone on board MH370, including the pilots, became unconscious due to oxygen deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The plane then continued flying on autopilot until its fuel ran out, eventually crashing into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

Possible causes for this oxygen deficiency include:
*   An electrical fire in the cockpit, which could have disabled systems like the transponder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   A sudden accident leading to a rapid loss of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   Even hijackers attempting to create oxygen deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

A typical scenario for this theory suggests that after entering Vietnamese airspace, pilots noticed malfunctions and turned the plane 180° back towards Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. A severe incident then caused oxygen deprivation, rendering everyone unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Several systems failed, and the plane continued on autopilot, detected by military radar before turning south over the Indian Ocean, ultimately crashing 2,000 km west of Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Other Unlikely Theories

Many other theories circulated initially, such as abduction by aliens, the US military shooting down the plane, Russian President Putin knowing its location, or the formation of a new [[theories_explaining_bermuda_triangle_disappearances | Bermuda Triangle]] in the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. These, however, are considered highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## New Developments and a Pinpointed Location (2022)

In 2022, Richard Godfrey, a retired aerospace engineer, claimed to have uncovered the mystery using [[new_technology_and_methods_in_locating_mh370 | new technology and methods in locating MH370]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. He combined data from the British Inmarsat Satellite, Boeing figures, Australian oceanographers, and a new amateur radio wave technology called WSPRnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

Godfrey utilized the reflections of weak radio waves, which can be disturbed by objects like airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. He developed a computer program to recognize flight paths through these weak signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. According to his calculations, MH370 lies precisely on the "7th Arc," 4 km underwater, in an area previously searched but potentially missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Godfrey is highly confident in his calculations, pinpointing the exact location with an accuracy of 40 Nautical Miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. He proposed a new search operation within this small radius, predicting it could take just one year to verify his findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

This new analysis is further supported by a "Drift Analysis," which models how ocean currents would carry debris from the assumed crash site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This analysis predicted debris reaching Madagascar and surrounding islands, which aligns with the 27 pieces of MH370 already recovered globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. While some criticize Godfrey's methodology as not accurate enough, his work offers renewed hope for solving the [[disappearance_of_malaysian_airlines_flight_mh370 | MH370 mystery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

The Baisaran Valley in Pahalgam, often called India's mini Switzerland, recently experienced a terrorist attack that targeted individuals based on their religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Of the 26 people who died, 24 were Hindus, one was a Muslim, and one was a Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Eyewitness accounts reported that terrorists specifically asked victims about their religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> and demanded the recitation of Islamic verses before shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

This attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), a shadow group of the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The overarching goal of terrorists is to spread religious hatred in India, incite conflict between different communities, and ultimately destabilize the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Political Exploitation and Divisive Narratives

After the Pahalgam attack, the official social media handles of BJP Chhattisgarh posted an image with the caption, "They asked for the religion not the caste," "We'll remember" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. This post was criticized by India Today's journalist Preeti Choudhary as an example of using a tragedy for political gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This behavior is seen as a form of [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | political exploitation of religious tensions in India]].

The post is interpreted to suggest two things:
*   A lack of intention to address caste-based discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   A continuation of spreading religious hatred within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

The narrative suggests that this approach aligns with the terrorists' agenda of breaking the country apart by making Hindus fight Muslims, leading to civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. A consistent theme on social media is the focus on "Hindus versus Muslims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, aiming to instill fear among Hindus about their Muslim neighbors and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### "Hindus in Danger" Narrative

Since 2014, a narrative has been propagated that Hindus are in "perpetual danger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. This includes claims about the Muslim population increasing by over 43% while the Hindu population decreased by 7.82% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Such claims are presented as a "conspiracy" to turn India into an Islamic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

## Caste-Based Discrimination

The political post also indirectly highlighted caste-based discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The speaker questions why only Dalits are beaten up for actions like riding horses in wedding processions, while upper-caste Hindus do not face such issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This demonstrates the existence of caste-based violence in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Call for Unity

Despite these divisions, various segments of Indian society have expressed unity against terrorism:
*   Kashmiris observed a shutdown and marched as a mark of unity, holding candlelight marches for victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Prominent Muslim organizations like Jamat-Ulama-e-Hind condemned the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   The head of the All India Imam Organisation, Imam Umer Ahmed Ilyasi, pledged to deliver strong anti-terror messages from 550,000 mosques during Friday prayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   Muslim countries including UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Qatar also condemned the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

The message emphasizes that people should not fight along religious lines to defeat the intentions of terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Any true patriot would want to strengthen their country and promote unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

All acts of violence, whether driven by religion, caste, or language, are detrimental to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Citizens are urged to criticize every violent incident without hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a> and resist "us versus them" propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a> to foster peace and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

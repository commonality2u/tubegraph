While large, terrestrial dinosaurs went extinct after the [[extinction_of_dinosaurs_due_to_asteroid_impact | asteroid impact]] 66 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and evolve: the flying dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Evolution of Flying Dinosaurs

During the [[dinosaur_evolution_through_triassic_to_cretaceous_periods | Jurassic Period]], some dinosaurs began to evolve the ability to fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. One of the earliest feathered dinosaurs was *Archaeopteryx*, which existed around 160 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The *Quetzalcoatlus*, a flying dinosaur from the [[dinosaur_evolution_through_triassic_to_cretaceous_periods | Cretaceous Period]], had an impressive wingspan of 10-11 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Survival of the Asteroid Impact

Small animals, including some birds, were among the few creatures that survived the initial impact of the asteroid and its subsequent effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. They found shelter underground, underwater, in caves, or inside large tree trunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The only group of dinosaurs that survived the mass [[extinction_of_dinosaurs_due_to_asteroid_impact | extinction event]] were these flying dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

## Birds as Modern Dinosaurs

These surviving flying dinosaurs gradually evolved into the birds we recognize today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Most studies confirm that birds belong to the same family as dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Specifically, chickens and ostriches share the closest ancestry with dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. This means that the closest living relative of the formidable T-Rex is, surprisingly, a chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

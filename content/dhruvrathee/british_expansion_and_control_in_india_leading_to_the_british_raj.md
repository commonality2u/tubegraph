The story of the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | British East India Company's]] expansion and control in India, which eventually led to the [[british_departure_from_india | British Raj]], is one of initial defeat, strategic maneuvering, and the exploitation of a declining empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Initial Encounters and Setbacks
In 1686, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | British East India Company]] declared war on the Mughals, who were then ruled by Aurangzeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This act was considered a significant blunder as the East India Company's army was considerably smaller and weaker than the Mughal army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Unsurprisingly, the Mughals easily defeated the Company, seizing their factories in India and arresting many of their officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The Company's governor at the time was forced to submit to Aurangzeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Despite this early defeat, approximately 300 years later, this foreign company would establish control over the entire Indian subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Foundation and Early Trade
The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] was founded in 1600 by a group of merchants as a Joint Stock Company, owned by shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Initially, 125 shareholders raised £70,000 to trade in spices from the Spice Islands of South-East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. In 1601, the Company undertook its maiden voyage, establishing two factories in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, they faced strong competition from established Spanish and Portuguese traders, and more recently, profitable Dutch traders who had a better army and more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Recognizing the lack of scope for competition with the Dutch, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | British East India Company]] decided to shift its operations and focus on India, which was rich in spices and textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Entry into India
In 1608, [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] merchants arrived in Surat, Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. At this time, the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughals]] ruled India with an army of 4 million soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Acknowledging the futility of conflict, the Company sought to establish friendly relations to obtain trading permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Captain William Hawkins traveled to Agra, the Mughal Capital, to meet Emperor Jahangir and request permission to set up a factory in Surat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Jahangir refused, primarily due to his good relations with the Portuguese traders already present in Surat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Undeterred, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] moved to other parts of India not controlled by the Mughals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. In 1611, they successfully established their first factory in Machlipatnam, Andhra Pradesh, with permission from the local ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Conflict and Diplomatic Successes
The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] consistently faced conflict with other European traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. In 1612, they returned to Surat and waged the Battle of Swally against the Portuguese, leading to a Portuguese defeat and the diminishing of their influence in India, primarily restricting them to Goa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This victory established the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] as the major player in the Indian subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

In 1615, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] requested King James I of England to send a royal representative to the Mughal emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Sir Thomas Roe, a diplomat, successfully impressed Jahangir with gifts, leading to a royal edict permitting the English to establish factories in Surat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] was also granted exclusive trading rights in certain territories in exchange for an annual payment to the Mughal emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Over the following decades, the Company's business flourished with new factories in Madras, Ahmedabad, Bombay, Agra, and Patna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. They traded in cotton, indigo, silk, salt, and later opium and tea, leading to economic prosperity in cities with their factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] began forming monopolies and building fortified bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Their ambitions grew, and they sought to establish factories across all Mughal territories, especially in the commercially successful region of Bengal (present-day West Bengal, Bangladesh, Bihar, and Odisha combined) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Evolution into a Political and Military Power
The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | Company's]] desire for political power stemmed from a need to ease trading and eliminate competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Around 1670, King Charles II granted the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] extensive rights, including the power to:
*   Acquire territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>
*   Hold political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
*   Mint money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
*   Oversee civil and criminal jurisdiction in their territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>
*   Maintain a private army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   Form alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   Declare wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

These unprecedented powers transformed the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] into an agent of imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### The Child's War and its Aftermath
In 1682, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] attempted to negotiate with Shaista Khan, the Mughal Governor of Bengal, for easier trade and tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Emperor Aurangzeb, deeming their request arrogant, rejected their petition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Josiah Child, the Governor of the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]], in his new-found arrogance from the royal grants, declared war on the Mughals in 1686 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This ill-fated decision resulted in a bitter defeat for the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]], forcing Josiah Child to beg Aurangzeb for forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Aurangzeb forgave them but levied a fine of ₹150,000 (equivalent to ₹350 million today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Their trading privileges and seized factories were eventually restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Mughal Decline and EIC's Rise
The [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Mughal Empire]] began to significantly weaken after Aurangzeb's death in 1707 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Constant power struggles and infighting among the Mughals led to local Nawabs and kings asserting their sovereign control over their regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Regional powers like the Marathas, Rajputs, Jats, and Rohillas emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The Mughals also faced external threats, including invasions by Persian ruler Nadir Shah in 1739 and Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. These conflicts, combined with regional governors withholding revenue, led to the financial problems and decentralization of the [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Mughal Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

During this period, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] strategically strengthened itself, investing in new technologies, setting up new factories, and recruiting more British soldiers for its private army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. They also trained local Indians, known as Sepoys, to join their army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Gaining Control of Bengal
The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] continued to pressure the Mughal throne for trading privileges in Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. In 1717, Emperor Farrukhsiyar granted the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] tax-free trading rights in Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This new royal edict also allowed the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | Company]] to issue a "Dastak," a trade permit that waived all custom and transit duties on their goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This was a significant win, as it allowed them to establish factories in Bengal and misuse the Dastak system to avoid taxes, severely impacting the Mughal Empire's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

In the same year, the Mughal Governor of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, declared Bengal independent of the [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Mughal Empire]] and became the Nawab of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Recognizing the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC's]] tactics, he ordered them to pay taxes, which the Company officials refused, looking down on the Bengali Nawab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] then decided to get involved in local politics to secure its profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the_17th_and_18th_centuries | European Competition and Imperial Tactics]]
As the [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Mughal Empire]] weakened, other European competitors like the Dutch, Danes, and French also expanded their influence in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The French, led by Governor General Joseph François Dupleix, rapidly established colonies in Pondicherry and Bengal's Chandernagore, aiming to build a French Empire in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. By the mid-1700s, the British and French became the two dominant European powers in the Indian subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

Existing enmity between France and Britain, fueled by wars in Europe (War of Austrian Succession, Seven Years' War) and North America, extended to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The Carnatic Wars (1746-1763) were fought in Southern India, with England emerging victorious, diminishing French political influence to only Pondicherry and Chandernagore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### Exploiting Local Politics
The wars between the British and French influenced Indian rulers, who, observing the superior European armies, formed alliances to utilize their resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This led to Indian rulers becoming dependent on Europeans, who then interfered in domestic politics, eroding local power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. European powers exploited this by bribing opposition leaders, supporting them with armies, and installing puppet rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Direct Control Through Conflict in Bengal
In 1756, Siraj-ud-Daulah became the new Nawab of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Fed up with the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC's]] constant disrespect, he attacked Fort William in Calcutta and jailed several British officers, an incident known as the Black Hole Tragedy of Calcutta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Infuriated, the British resolved to remove Siraj-ud-Daulah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

Under Robert Clive's leadership, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] allied with Siraj-ud-Daulah's rivals, including the powerful Jagath Seth family of bankers and his army commander, Mir Jafar, who desired to become Nawab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Siraj-ud-Daulah, aware of the plot, allied with the French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

### Battle of Plassey (1757)
The Battle of Plassey was fought in June 1757 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Despite Siraj-ud-Daulah's army being 15 times larger, he lost the battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The British installed Mir Jafar as the new puppet Nawab of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Siraj-ud-Daulah was assassinated, and French presence in Bengal ended, with Chandernagore falling under British control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The Battle of Plassey marked a crucial turning point, as the British gained indirect political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### Battle of Buxar (1764)
Mir Jafar, the puppet Nawab, soon disagreed with the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] and allied with the Dutch to expel them from Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | Company]] removed him and installed his son-in-law, Mir Qasim, as the new Nawab in 1761 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Mir Qasim, however, also sought freedom from British interference and went to war with British forces in 1763 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. The powerful British forces defeated him, removing him from the throne and reinstating Mir Jafar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

Mir Qasim then formed a powerful alliance with the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daula, and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, to eradicate British influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Their combined forces fought the British in the Battle of Buxar in 1764, but the British emerged victorious once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Formalizing British Rule: The Treaty of Allahabad
After the Battle of Buxar, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] decided to end the system of puppet rulers and directly govern Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. In 1765, under the Treaty of Allahabad, Robert Clive became the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Crucially, Shah Alam II issued an edict granting "Diwani Rights" of Bengal to the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This meant all revenue from taxes collected in Bengal would go solely to the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | Company]], officially making them the new rulers of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Their revenue grew manifold, allowing them to fund trade, strengthen their military, and invest in infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

## Expansion Across India: Indirect and Direct Control
By this point, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] possessed the funds, resources, and power to expand its territory across India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. They employed several techniques:

1.  **Residents:** British officials, known as Residents, were appointed as diplomats to various states and regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. They established friendly relations with local rulers and subtly interfered in local politics through their "advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.
2.  **Subsidiary Alliance:** Local rulers were pressured to enter into a Subsidiary Alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Under this system, rulers were forbidden from having their own armies; instead, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] would maintain an army on their behalf, for which the local ruler would pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. If a ruler failed to pay, a portion of their territory would be confiscated by the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | Company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. This system indirectly brought vast areas under [[british_east_india_company_in_india | EIC]] control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. These regions later became known as the Princely States of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. Hyderabad was the first state to form a Subsidiary Alliance in 1798 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
3.  **Military Force:** If other techniques failed, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] resorted to brute military force to occupy new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

By 1818, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] had become the most powerful entity in the Indian subcontinent, controlling approximately two-thirds of the land and 78% of its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

### The Doctrine of Lapse
A fourth technique, the Doctrine of Lapse, was introduced in 1847 and primarily enforced by Lord Dalhousie between 1848 and 1856 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This doctrine stipulated that if an Indian ruler died without a natural male heir, their kingdom would automatically "lapse" and become part of the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company's]] territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. This led to the annexation of prominent cities like Satara (1848), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853), Jhansi (1854), and Awadh (1856) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

### Administrative Reforms
The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] also implemented continuous administrative reforms, such as the Regulating Act of 1773, which created the post of Governor General of Bengal, first held by Warren Hastings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. These reforms facilitated the regulation of vast territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. By the early 1800s, the remaining major powers in India, other than the British, were the Maratha Empire and the Mysore Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

## End of Company Rule and the British Raj
Following the Doctrine of Lapse and the Revolt of 1857 (known as the First War of Independence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>, the British government nationalized the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] under the Government of India Act of 1858 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. All territories, military forces, and wealth accumulated by the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | Company]] were transferred to the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This marked the end of the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company's]] rule and the beginning of the [[political_events_leading_to_indian_independence | British Raj]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. The Company was finally dissolved in 1874 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. The [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Mughal Empire]] officially ended after 1857, with the last emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, exiled to Burma and his successors killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

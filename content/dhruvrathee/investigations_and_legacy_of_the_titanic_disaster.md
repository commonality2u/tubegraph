After the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic's sinking]], extensive investigations were launched, leading to the revelation of several shocking facts and controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54"></a>.

## SS Californian's Role

One critical revelation was the presence of another ship, the SS Californian, just 37 kilometers away from the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] on the night of the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05"></a>. This ship could have potentially saved many passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12"></a>.

The SS Californian had issued the last iceberg warning one hour before the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] struck the iceberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20"></a>. However, at 11:15 PM, the Californian's radio operator switched off the radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33"></a>. The ship had stopped for the night due to the danger of icebergs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41"></a>. Because its radio was off, it did not receive the distress signals from the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48"></a>.

Passengers on the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic's]] deck could see the Californian on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55"></a>. An officer even expressed belief that the visible ship would soon arrive to rescue them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04"></a>. Despite rockets and flares being lit from the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]], the Californian did not respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16"></a>. After midnight, the Californian's crew members reportedly saw the rockets and informed their captain, Stanley Lord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21"></a>. However, Captain Lord dismissed them as signals from rich passengers partying, rather than distress calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30"></a>.

Had Captain Lord taken the rockets and flares seriously, many lives could have been saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41"></a>. The next morning, when the Californian's radio was turned on, they received the SOS calls, but it was too late, with only dead bodies found floating in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50"></a>. Both inquiries conducted into the disaster placed blame on Captain Lord of the Californian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01"></a>.

## Contributing Factors and Mistakes

While Captain Lord was blamed, it was recognized that a disaster of this scale could not be attributed to one person alone; others were also responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08"></a>.

*   **Insufficient Lifeboats**: The [[safety_measures_and_failures_on_the_titanic | Titanic]] had only 20 lifeboats, capable of accommodating approximately 1,200 people, despite having about 2,200 people on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15"></a>. This deficiency stemmed from the belief by the ship's manufacturer that the "unsinkable" vessel rendered more lifeboats unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18"></a>.
*   **Cancelled Safety Drills**: Captain Edward John Smith had cancelled a safety drill scheduled for the day the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] collided with the iceberg, deeming them unnecessary due to the ship's unsinkable reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24"></a>.
*   **Steering Error**: The steersman, Robert Hichens, who was at the wheel when the iceberg alarm sounded, panicked and mistakenly steered the ship to the right (towards the iceberg) instead of the instructed left direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39"></a>. By the time he realized his error, it was too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04"></a>.
*   **Excessive Speed**: The British inquiry found that despite numerous iceberg warnings advising caution, the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] continued to sail at full speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08"></a>.
*   **Company Pressure**: A popular theory suggests that Joseph Bruce, the chairman and managing director of White Star Line (the company that built the [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]]), pressured Captain Smith to maintain the ship's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23"></a>. The company had immense pressure for the ship to complete its maiden voyage in six days to break a speed record, showcasing it not just as the biggest and most expensive, but also the fastest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38"></a>. An incident on April 14th, 1912, at 2 PM, reportedly involved Captain Smith showing Joseph an ice warning, suggesting a speed reduction. Joseph allegedly pocketed the paper to prevent crew members from finding out and slowing the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53"></a>.

## Legacy and Regulatory Changes

The [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] disaster irrevocably changed the maritime industry worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12"></a>. Many new regulations and standards were established to prevent similar future disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17"></a>.

*   **International Ice Patrol**: In 1914, an International Ice Patrol was established to alert oncoming ships about icebergs in their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22"></a>.
*   **SOLAS Treaty**: The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) treaty was signed, setting new standards for ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31"></a>.
*   **Lifeboat Regulation**: A new lifeboat regulation was framed, mandating that ships must carry a sufficient number of lifeboats for every passenger on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39"></a>.

## Discovery of the Wreckage

It took over 70 years to find the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic's]] wreckage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46"></a>. In September 1985, American ocean explorer Robert Ballard and a French oceanographer successfully located the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54"></a>. The wreckage was found 3,800 meters (3.8 kilometers) under the sea, in two separate pieces located 600 meters apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05"></a>.

Today, environmental factors have begun to erode the submerged ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16"></a>. Bacteria and other organisms are reportedly consuming its metal framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28"></a>. It is estimated that by 2030, the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] will have completely disintegrated underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33"></a>.

## Continued Fascination and Modern Attempts

Even after 110 years, public fascination with the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39"></a>. In 2012, Australian billionaire Clive Palmer announced plans to build [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] II, an exact replica of the original, intended to sail the same route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46"></a>. While initially projected for completion by 2016, the project has faced delays and was not completed by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05"></a>. It is suggested that public interest in the project has waned because an exact replica would lack modern amenities like TV or Wi-Fi, making it unappealing to contemporary passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11"></a>.

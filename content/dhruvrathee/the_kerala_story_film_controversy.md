From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

*The Kerala Story* is a recently released film that has generated significant discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The film depicts a secret plot in Kerala where innocent women are allegedly forcefully converted to Islam and sent to ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. According to the film and its director, this has happened to approximately 32,000 girls who are now purportedly "buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Propaganda Techniques Utilized

The film appears to employ propaganda techniques, echoing concepts like Adolf Hitler's "Big Lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Hitler's "Big Lie" technique suggests telling such an outrageous falsehood that people believe "no one can make up such an outrageous lie," thus convincing them there must be some truth to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, also emphasized the importance of repetition: continuously repeating the "Big Lie" from multiple sources to convince people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A third technique, the "Half-Truth," involves including elements of truth in speeches to make outrageous lies more convincing to those who might otherwise dismiss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These three techniques are suggested to have been used to mislead people regarding `The Kerala Story` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## [[factual_inaccuracies_in_the_kerala_story_film | Factual Inaccuracies in The Kerala Story Film]]

The director of `The Kerala Story`, Sudipto Sen, cited several "true incidents" that supposedly inspired the film, which upon closer examination, appear to be [[factual_inaccuracies_in_the_kerala_story_film | half-truths]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Most people tend to skim headlines without delving into details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Oommen Chandy's Statement

The director referred to a 2010 statement by former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. An India Today report from 2012 cited Chandy's statement in the state legislature that 2,667 women converted to Islam between 2006 and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, Chandy never used the term "forced conversions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. He explicitly stated that forced conversions would not be allowed and hate campaigns against Muslims, including accusations of Love Jihad, would not be tolerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Furthermore, there was no mention that these converted women were joining ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### V.S. Achuthanandan's Interview

Another citation by the director was an interview with former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan, who served from 2006 to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The video circulated, uploaded by Sunshine Pictures (the film's production company), had inaccurate English subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. In the actual interview, Achuthanandan was criticizing PFI, stating that they were trying to influence youth of other religions by paying them to marry Muslim women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. ISIS was not mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Thirteen years after this statement, Kerala remains a safe and secular state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### The "Fatima" Story

The film's teaser features a girl claiming to be Fatima, imprisoned in Afghanistan's jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. A June 2021 article from The Hindu reported on four women from Kerala who went to Afghanistan with their husbands to join the Islamic State of Khorasan Province between 2016 and 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Their husbands were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. These women included Nimisha alias Fathima Isa, Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha, Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam, and Reffeala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

NIA's 2016 list of 20 most wanted Indians in Islamic State included these four women, plus Ajmala and Shamasia, whose husbands were cousins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Of these six women, three were already Muslims, two converted from Christianity to Islam, and one converted from Hinduism to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The one woman originally Hindu was Nimisha Nair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Nimisha's husband, Eeza, converted to Islam from Christianity (formerly Bexon Vincent), and his brother Bestin, also a convert, was married to one of the other four women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Both brothers and their wives were converts and brainwashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The Indian government recently denied these four women permission to return to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Video interviews of Nimisha, Sonia Sebastian, and Reffeala from 2020 on StratNews Global show their continued radicalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. In contrast, the main character in `The Kerala Story` constantly seeks sympathy, a stark difference from the real-life women's demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### The "32,000 Women" Claim (The Big Lie)

The film states that 32,000 women from Kerala have been sent to ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This claim is widely considered a [[factual_inaccuracies_in_the_kerala_story_film | "Big Lie"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

#### Global and Indian ISIS Recruitment Statistics

*   **Global**: Vladimir Voronkov, UN Undersecretary General of the United Nations Office of Counter Terrorism, stated that nearly 40,000 foreign terrorist fighters from 110 countries went to Syria and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. A 2018 study by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization at King's College, London, estimated 41,490 people from 80 countries were affiliated with ISIS, with 79% being men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The global estimate for ISIS foreign fighters is around 40,000-42,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **India**:
    *   The US Bureau of Counter-Terrorism reported in 2020 that by September 2020, NIA had investigated 34 cases of terrorism and arrested 160 people related to ISIS in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   An October 2019 paper by the Observer Research Foundation stated 180-200 pro-ISIS cases in India between 2014 and 2018, including those spreading propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    *   In 2019, the Indian Home Ministry put this number at 155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   Of the 180-200 cases, approximately 40 were from Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   The US Department of State reported around 66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS as of November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. A 2018 StratNews Global report cited a similar figure of around 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   Of these 60, approximately 13 were women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Only six women were from Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   Of these six, three converted to Islam from other religions (two Christians, one Hindu) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

#### The Reality vs. The Claim

The events depicted in the film, implying a widespread conspiracy, only happened to three women in real life, and not in the manner shown in the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The film's claim of 32,000 women is presented as a "Big Lie" designed to make people believe a smaller, but still exaggerated, number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The director evaded questions about the source of the 32,000 figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. He told Alt News he would share data after the film's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, told The Quint that asking such questions was "cliched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, and at a JNU screening, called 32,000 an "arbitrary number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. When the matter reached court, the film's description was changed from 32,000 to 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

Exaggerating three individual cases to 32,000 is considered misleading and defames the entire state of Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. An analogy is given: if a film titled `The India Story` claimed 32,000 incidents of Indians urinating on co-passengers, based on three real cases, it would be seen as nonsense and defamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### The "Love Jihad" Claim

Another "Big Lie" propagated by the film is "Love Jihad," portraying forced religious conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Official investigations contradict this claim:
*   In 2017, the Kerala government submitted 90 cases to the NIA for investigation into "Love Jihad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The NIA examined 11 and concluded in 2018 that while PFI facilitated conversion, not a single case of forced conversion was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   In 2020, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy told Lok Sabha that no case of "Love Jihad" had been reported by any central agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

This conspiracy theory of "Love Jihad" is spread through political speeches, WhatsApp forwards, and propaganda news channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. It is also criticized for being misogynistic, implying women can be easily manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. If forced conversion occurs, law enforcement can intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

#### Religious Conversions in India

Data shows a balance in religious conversions in India. A 2021 report on Kerala registrations found 47% converted from Christianity or Islam to Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. A 2021 Pew Research Center survey of over 30,000 people found that 0.7% left Hinduism for other religions, and 0.8% left other religions for Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

## Why India Has Fewer ISIS Recruits

Compared to other countries, India has a remarkably low number of ISIS recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. While India has approximately 66 victims of ISIS propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, other countries have significantly higher numbers: 7,000 in former Soviet republics (2,500 from Russia), 1,700 in France, 760 in Germany, and about 700 in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. These countries have much smaller populations than India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

Despite having the world's third-largest Muslim population, India has fewer ISIS recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The ratio of ISIS recruits per million people in India is 0.5, significantly lower than France (18 per million), Belgium (40 per million), and Jordan (315 per million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

Several factors contribute to this:

*   **Indian Agencies' Response**: Indian agencies like the NIA and IB launched "Operation Pigeon," identifying 350 vulnerable Malayali youth and implementing a de-radicalization program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **India's Syncretic Culture**: Former diplomat Talmiz Ahmad attributes this to India's syncretic culture and tradition of "Unity in Diversity," where Muslims coexist harmoniously with Hindus and Christians, rejecting extreme ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. ISIS itself considered Indian recruits "inferior" in 2015, believing that the Islam practiced in India is a "soft" and "liberal" version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Role of Muslim Clerics**: Muslim clerics have played a positive role. In March 2009, Darul Uloom Deoband issued a fatwa declaring India as Dar al-Aman (a country where militant Jihad is prohibited) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. In 2015, 70,000 Indian Muslim scholars issued a joint fatwa against ISIS, Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

The "real Kerala story" is one of pride, showcasing how few Indian Muslims joined ISIS compared to global figures, and how Kerala exemplifies unity in diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Kerala leads in education, healthcare, and human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

## Political Propaganda and Misinformation

The film is seen as part of a larger trend of [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | propaganda and misinformation]]. The Prime Minister has promoted this film of lies in his election speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Home Minister Amit Shah also maligned Kerala during election campaigning in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Such films are compared to those made during Hitler's rule, which distorted history, defamed Jews, and glorified German Aryans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. The goal is seen as spreading hatred and division between Hindus, Muslims, and Christians for political power and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. This represents a shift from WhatsApp forwards to propaganda-enabling media and now to propaganda films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

> [!INFO] Recommendation
> For a more accurate depiction of ISIS recruitment, the Swedish TV series *The Caliphate* on Netflix is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. It tells a true story of ISIS recruiting young girls in Sweden without defamation or propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

The heinous crime involving a 31-year-old trainee doctor at Kolkata's R.G.Kar Hospital has deeply shocked the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This incident led to widespread protests across the country, including West Bengal, with doctors going on strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Protesters were reportedly attacked by goons, and the hospital was ransacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This case brought to the forefront the persistent [[security_issues_in_india | security issues]] and challenges regarding women's safety in India.

## Key Incidents and Official Responses

### The Kolkata Case (2024)

The primary culprit in the Kolkata case was identified as Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer in the West Bengal Police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Roy had a history of domestic violence, with three previous marriages ending due to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This raised questions about the recruitment process for civic volunteers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> and how he gained access to all hospital departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Police arrested Roy using CCTV footage, his Bluetooth device, and DNA samples, and he confessed to the crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

West Bengal's Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, who also holds the portfolios for Home and Health, faced significant scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Her decision to lead a protest rally after the incident was widely questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Amid demands to transfer the case to the CBI, CM Banerjee initially stated she had no problem with it and would transfer it if the police couldn't make progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. However, the Calcutta High Court, citing a lack of trustworthiness in the state police, ordered the case to be handed over to the CBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The High Court emphasized that such demands reflect the public's diminished trust in the state police, marking a failure of the Home and Chief Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Concerns were also raised about the appointment of Sandeep Ghosh as the principal of R.G.Kar Medical College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Ghosh was accused of corruption and running the college like a mafia, with his transfers repeatedly stopped, possibly due to his alleged closeness to TMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He was accused of attempting to suppress the matter, playing it off as a suicide, delaying the FIR, and preventing the victim's parents from seeing the body for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Despite being removed from R.G.Kar, he was then appointed principal of Calcutta National College, a move the Calcutta High Court deemed "nonsense" and subsequently sent him on extended leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The West Bengal government formed an SIT to investigate corruption charges against Sandeep Ghosh, and the CBI has interrogated him multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

In response to public demand for justice, the West Bengal government announced initiatives for women's safety in workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The Supreme Court also took suo-moto cognizance, stating, "What is equality under the Constitution if women can't be safe in their workplace and are being denied basic equality?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Other Recent Incidents

Following the Kolkata case, similar incidents were reported:
*   **Uttarakhand:** A nurse experienced a similar incident involving a bus driver and conductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Bengaluru:** A 21-year-old college student faced a similar crime while returning home from a party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Maharashtra (Badalapur):** A school cleaning staff member was reported for sexually abusing two girls aged 3 and 4, leading to hundreds of agitated parents blocking the railway station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Rising Trend of Violence

While these recent reports might suggest an increase in cases, the speaker notes that rapes happen daily but are not reported or protested every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Large-scale [[protests_and_citizens_rights_in_india | protests and outrage]] have historically occurred around specific high-profile cases:
*   **2012:** Nirbhaya case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
*   **2019:** Hyderabad veterinary doctor case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   **2020:** Hathras case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   **2024:** Kolkata case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>

Despite periodic outrage, the situation has worsened over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   Around 2012, approximately 25,000 rape cases were reported annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   According to the latest NCRB figures, in 2022, 31,000 cases were reported, averaging 85 rape cases per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Compared to population growth (1.14 times since 2012), rape cases have increased at a higher rate (1.25 times), indicating a clear worsening of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Societal Attitudes and Victim Blaming

The speaker highlights an "absurdity" in society: while people protest for a week, they behave as if everything is fine for the rest of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. An uncomfortable discussion is necessary because many individuals indirectly contribute to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

> [!quote]
> Vir Das famously observed that "we are living in Two Indias": one where women are worshipped, and another where they are subjected to heinous crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This truth made people uncomfortable, leading to the banning of documentaries like Leslee Udwin's "India's Daughter," which aimed to highlight the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Conditional Acceptance of Rape as "Wrong"

While everyone intellectually agrees that rape is wrong, many apply "conditions" to this belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

*   **Rape Threats as Justification:** Individuals like Nupur Sharma, a BJP leader, received death and rape threats for objectionable statements about Prophet Mohammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Similarly, historian Audrey Truschke received threats for her historical findings on Aurangzeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. These threats are unacceptable in a civilized society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Condemning Critics of Political Opinion:** Human rights lawyer Indira Jaising faced severe criticism and calls for her imprisonment from Kangana Ranaut for speaking against capital punishment for Nirbhaya's rapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Political Support for Convicted Rapists:**
    *   The release and honoring of Bilkis Bano's convicted rapists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   Silence on cases like Prajwal Revanna, accused of sexually exploiting over 2,500 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    *   Repeated parole for convicted rapist Gurmeet Ram Rahim before elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   Rallies supporting accused rapists like Brij Bhusan Singh, Kuldeep Sengar, and those in the Kathua case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
    *   BJP leader Choudhary Lal Singh, who supported rape accused, later receiving an election ticket from Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

These examples show that while publicly agreeing rape is wrong, people often apply "conditions" based on political opinion or other biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Victim Blaming

> [!quote]
> "Rape is wrong. Full stop. Giving rape threats is wrong. Full stop. But the problem is that people keep on adding ifs and buts." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>

This "if and but" mentality extends to various forms of victim blaming:

*   **Romantic Relationships/Consent Misconceptions:**
    *   In the Hathras case, media outlets like Zee News and News18, and BJP leader Manoharlal Khattar, suggested the victim had a "love affair" with the accused or knew them, implying it was not rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee made similar insensitive statements regarding the 2022 Nadia rape case of a 14-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
    *   The speaker stresses that love does not grant a license to rape; consent is crucial and reversible, and for minors (under 18 years as per POCSO Act 2012), consent is not considered at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

*   **"Out Late at Night" Argument:**
    *   After two minors were raped in Goa, BJP leader and CM Pramod Sawant questioned why the girls were out at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. A Jharkhand MLA made a similar statement after a tribal girl was raped and murdered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
    *   One of Nirbhaya's rapists, Mukesh Singh, held this same belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
    *   This argument is nonsensical; rapes happen because rapists are out, not because girls are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
    *   NCRB reports consistently show that in over 90% of cases, the accused knew the victim (95% in 2015, 93% in 2017, 96.8% in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This includes neighbors, friends, co-workers, and family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

*   **"Loose Character" and Objectification:**
    *   The belief that sexual harassment is a sign of a girl's "loose character" is prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
    *   People often categorize women as either goddesses or mere objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The Constitution guarantees freedom to every woman as a human, regardless of profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
    *   Films perpetuate this by showing characters like Akshay Kumar forcibly kissing a woman for "comedy" in *Kambakht Ishq* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a> or molesting at knifepoint in *Kabir Singh* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
    *   Films like *Anaarkali of Aarah* and *Pink* sensitively counter these narratives, emphasizing a woman's right to her own body and that drinking alcohol does not imply consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

*   **"Short Clothes" Argument:**
    *   This is presented as a "vile, nonsensical argument" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
    *   The speaker refutes this by asking why children, older women, mentally ill individuals, or women in traditional attire are raped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
    *   Despite its absurdity, many people, including 39.2% of surveyed women, believe revealing clothes lead to rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

*   **Alcohol/Intoxication:**
    *   The excuse that "the girl was drunk" is another common form of victim blaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
    *   While alcohol can be harmful, it doesn't judge character or excuse sexual assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Consent is still required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
    *   Section 63 of the BNS states that consent given while intoxicated can be grounds for rape charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Understanding the Act of Rape

### Debunking the "Sexual Urge" Myth

A popular misconception, often perpetuated by media like the film *Maharaja* and old Hindi films, is that rape is caused by uncontrollable "sexual urge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This is false; sexual urge has nothing to do with rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Many rapists have consenting partners or are married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### Categories of Rapists

Rape is primarily about power and control, not sexual desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Rapists generally fall into three categories:
1.  **Power Rapists:** Driven by self-worth issues, they seek to feel powerful through the act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
2.  **Anger Rapists:** Motivated by anger, they are abusive and violent, often killing their victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
3.  **Sadistic Rapists:** Derive pleasure from the victim's physical and mental suffering, often torturing them for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

While some rapists may have a history of mental illness, it's wrong to generalize, as not all rapists are mentally ill; they are simply "monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Root Causes of Rapist Behavior

Research on offenders, including rapists, identified several contributing factors to their personality formation:
*   Child abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>
*   Pornography exposure before age 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>
*   Physical abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>
*   Parental violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>
*   Emotional abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>
*   Cruelty to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>
*   Exposure to violent movies or media in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>
*   Anxious or distant relationships with parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>

Understanding these causes is crucial for preventing the formation of new rapists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## The Pervasiveness of Rape Culture

The expression of dominance, anger, or sadism as rape is facilitated by "Rape Culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. This global term refers to societal attitudes, mass media, and traditions that normalize or trivialize rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

*   **Normalization in Media and Daily Life:**
    *   Films and stand-up comedy often use rape as a shallow plot device or for "comedy," normalising sexual violence through vulgar language and jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
    *   Even in casual conversations, insults directed at mothers and sisters contribute to this normalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
    *   This leads to "rape normalization," where people laugh at rape jokes and feel no guilt watching rape videos or giving rape threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

*   **Lack of Regret Among Rapists:**
    *   Psychologist Madhumita Pandey's research found that most convicted murderers regretted their crimes, but most rapists showed no remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. This explains why many are repeat offenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
    *   This lack of regret stems from regressive views about women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, reinforcing Susan Brown Miller's finding that rape is a "conscious process of intimidation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

*   **Toxic Masculinity and Patriarchy:**
    *   This culture views women as "inferior subhuman" objects rather than free individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
    *   Advertisements and songs often objectify women (e.g., Ranbir Kapoor's ad, Kareena Kapoor's "Tandoori Chicken" song, Badshah's and Honey Singh's lyrics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
    *   Such media glamorize assaulters and stylize toxic masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
    *   This double standard (a man surrounded by girls is a "stud," a girl surrounded by guys is a "slut") further entrenches the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

## Solutions

Addressing the problem of women's safety requires a multi-pronged approach involving everyone:

1.  **Addressing Root Causes and Prevention:**
    *   **Government Initiatives:** Accelerate [[education_and_womens_empowerment_as_solutions | women's empowerment]] across departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
    *   **Education:** Prioritize education, improve employment conditions, and implement sex education in schools, including teaching about good touch and bad touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
    *   **Legal Processes:** Governments must improve legal processes to ensure swift and fair justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

2.  **Changing Societal Attitudes:**
    *   **Eradicate Sexist Language:** Make a commitment to stop using insults targeted at women in daily life or on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
    *   **No Rape Threats/Jokes:** Never make rape threats or laugh at rape jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
    *   **Call Out Sexism:** Actively call out and raise voices against sexist attitudes in ads, films, songs, online content, or stand-up acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

3.  **Strengthening Law and Order:**
    *   **Police Reform:** Fill vacancies in the police force and ensure greater independence from state governments to prevent political interference in justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

By working on these three fronts, society can collectively move towards eradicating the problem of violence against women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

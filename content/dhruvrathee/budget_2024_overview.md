Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented Budget 2024 on July 23rd, leading to a significant negative public reaction across various demographics, including supporters of the current government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Many expressed anger, with sentiments shifting from earlier support to criticism regarding tax policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Comedian Abhijit Ganguly's viral tweet highlighted the frustration with multiple layers of taxation:
> "If I earn money, Nirmala taxes it. If I spend money, then also Nirmala taxes it. If I don't earn or spend both and my money is just lying in investment, Nirmala taxes that too! And the best part is, if I pay tax, there is an additional cess on it, so Nirmala taxes the tax amount." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

This sentiment was further illustrated by a viral flowchart showing direct tax (30% on salary), short-term investment tax (20%), long-term investment tax (12.5%), and GST on spending (12% to 28%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Key Budget Changes and Public Reactions

### Capital Gains Tax Adjustments
A heavily criticized aspect of the budget is the adjustment to the [[impact_of_capital_gains_tax_changes | Capital Gains Tax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This tax applies to profits from selling assets like property or investments in the stock market and mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Short-Term Capital Gains Tax (STCG)**: Increased by 5%, from 15% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Capital Gains Tax (LTCG)**: Increased by 2.5%, from 10% to 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   The exemption limit for LTCG has been raised from ₹100,000 to ₹125,000, meaning profits below this amount are exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

These changes have angered stock market and mutual fund investors, as they are directly detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Securities Transaction Tax (STT)
For Futures and Options trading, the Securities Transaction Tax has also increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   **Futures**: From 0.0125% to 0.02% of the transaction value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Options**: From 0.0625% to 0.1% of the option premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Changes to Non-Financial Assets (Property)
While the LTCG tax on non-financial assets like land or houses appears reduced from 20% to 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, the government has removed "indexation benefits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Indexation adjusts the acquisition cost for inflation, leading to a lower taxable gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Without indexation, the entire non-inflated profit becomes taxable, potentially leading to higher tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This change particularly impacts the lower middle class aspiring to buy their first home, as it aims to discourage property speculation and prevent a "Real Estate bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Angel Tax Removal
The budget proposes removing the Angel Tax, which was levied on startups issuing shares above their fair market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This decision has been praised by opposition parties, as it was a long-standing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### Income Tax Adjustments
Minor changes were made to Income Tax, offering negligible benefits to the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>:
*   **Standard Deduction**: Increased from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Tax Slabs**: Slight adjustments to the lower income brackets, for example, the 5% tax rate now applies up to ₹700,000 annual income, compared to ₹600,000 previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
These changes are seen as minimal compared to the more frequent slab increases under previous governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. For instance, LTCG tax was 0% in 2004 under Dr. Manmohan Singh, only to be reintroduced by the Modi government in 2018 and now increased to 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## Government Justifications and Economic Survey
The government's justification for increased taxes on investments may be found in the Economic Survey of 2023-2024, presented before the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The survey suggests that excessively high equity market claims can be a "harbinger of market instability" rather than resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, implying a desire to discourage excessive stock market speculation, particularly in risky Futures and Options trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

The Economic Survey also detailed the problem of unemployment, noting that 7.85 million jobs are needed annually until 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. It admits that one out of two Indian graduates is unemployable due to lack of skills and highlights Artificial Intelligence as the "biggest disruption for the future of work" across all skill levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Government Schemes and Initiatives
The budget allocates ₹2 Trillion for five key schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>:
1.  **First Time Employment Support**: Up to ₹15,000 from the government for those joining their first job and registered with EPFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
2.  **Manufacturing Sector Benefits**: More benefits for employees and employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
3.  **Employer Support**: Government contribution of up to ₹3,000 per month for two years in EPFO to encourage hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
4.  **Skilling Scheme**: To skill 2 million youth over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
5.  **Internship Opportunities**: Promise to provide 12-month internship opportunities for 1 million youth in top 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

Skepticism exists regarding the implementation of these job schemes, as the Finance Minister has stated they will not be compulsory for companies but merely a "nudge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## [[regional_budget_allocations_and_political_implications | Regional Budget Allocations and Political Implications]]
The budget has been criticized for its distribution of funds among states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Significant allocations were made to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, particularly:
*   **Andhra Pradesh**: ₹150 billion for the development of Amravati capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Bihar**: ₹600 billion for infrastructure projects (expressways, power plants, airports) and ₹115 billion for flood mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Bihar also received the largest share of the Tourism Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

This focus is perceived as an effort by the BJP minority government to appease its allies, TDP and JDU, leading to Rahul Gandhi calling it a "Seat Conservation Budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Previously, the BJP government often favored Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## Conclusion: Income Inequality and Taxation Philosophy
A major point of criticism is the perceived favoritism towards the wealthy and large corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Income tax accounts for 19% of government revenue, GST for 18%, but corporate tax contributes merely 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This contrasts with periods before 2014-15, when corporate tax was the majority share of government revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

The budget is viewed by some as squeezing the middle class while granting benefits to millionaires and billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This contributes to growing income inequality, a situation described as worse than during the British Raj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Critics advocate for promoting small businesses over large corporations and taxing billionaires more instead of burdening the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. The future impact of these policies remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

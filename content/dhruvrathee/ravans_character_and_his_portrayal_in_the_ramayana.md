Ravan, a central figure in Valmiki's Ramayan, is traditionally known as the demon lord who kidnapped Sita, leading to a war with Lord Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This conflict is typically presented as a triumph of good over evil, and justice over injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## [[the_shift_in_perception_of_ravan_in_modern_times | The Shift in Perception of Ravan]]

Despite the traditional narrative of "Hero Ram versus Villain Ravan," there has been a recent [[the_shift_in_perception_of_ravan_in_modern_times | shift in perception]] where some social media posts and WhatsApp messages go against this established view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This includes a growing sympathy for Ravan and his brother Kumbhkaran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Across the political spectrum, both left-wing and right-wing individuals have developed a "soft corner" for Ravan, coming up with justifications for his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## [[temples_and_worship_of_ravan_in_india | Temples and Worship of Ravan]]

Contrary to his villainous portrayal, there are [[temples_and_worship_of_ravan_in_india | temples in India]] where Ravan is worshipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Examples include:
*   A temple in Madhya Pradesh's Ravangaon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   The Dashanan Ravan temple in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   A temple in Greater Noida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Temples in Rajasthan's Jodhpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Temples in Andhra Pradesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Worshippers at these temples chant "Jai Lankesh" and "Jai Ravan Baba" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Online, poems expressing admiration for Ravan, such as "Let the world emulate Ram, I like being Ravan," have gained millions of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Some people acknowledge his negative actions but highlight his positive aspects, such as his scholarship, devotion to Lord Shiva, and Brahmin identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. They believe he was a scholar of the Vedas and holy scriptures, a master at playing the Veena, and question why his effigies are burned instead of respecting his virtues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

> "People believe him to be wrong, be he wasn't." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
>
> "Ravan will be remembered forever. Ravan will be immortal." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>

## Arguments and Rebuttals Regarding Ravan's Character

Analysis of religious texts like the Ramayan is encouraged to gain new perspectives and counter hate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Historical discussions and debates on such texts have been an integral part of Indian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Ravan's Positive Qualities vs. His Actions

The argument that Ravan's scholarship, devotion to Shiva, and Brahmin identity make him worthy of respect is countered by the idea that positive attributes do not nullify criminal actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Examples of other individuals with notable talents or intelligence who committed heinous crimes are given to illustrate this point:
*   Adolf Hitler, a skilled painter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British Pakistani terrorist, who was intelligent enough to get into the London School of Economics, was a chess champion, and fluent in five languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

These examples highlight that intelligence or talent does not excuse evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Similarly, Ravan's talents or knowledge do not make his crime of kidnapping Sita any less evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The point is that even a scholar, Shiv devotee, and Brahmin can be a Ravan too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Ravan as a Good Administrator

Some argue that Ravan was a brilliant administrator who ruled his kingdom well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. However, Valmiki's Ramayan contains no evidence to support this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. In fact, his sister Surpanakha criticized him as:
*   Addicted to vulgar pleasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   Unguided, lustful, greedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   A king who neglected his masses and couldn't protect his country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   A fool surrounded by ordinary ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   Harsh, arrogant, intoxicated, short-tempered, evil-minded, and lacking good qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
Ravan, described as arrogant, acknowledged his wrongdoings after hearing these accusations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Kidnapping of Sita as Revenge for Surpanakha

A common justification for Ravan's kidnapping of Sita is that he sought to avenge his sister Surpanakha, whose nose and ears were cut off by Lakshman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. However, Valmiki's Ramayan (Aranyakand, Chapters 17 and 18) provides a different account:
*   Surpanakha first approached Ram for marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   She insulted Sita, calling her "ugly, deformed, disfigured, fearful woman with a flat belly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   She threatened to eat Sita and Lakshman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   After Ram redirected her to Lakshman, and Lakshman rejected her, Surpanakha explicitly said she would eat Sita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   She then attempted to kill Sita, prompting Lakshman to cut off her nose and ears with a sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
Furthermore, when Surpanakha recounted the events to Ravan, she did not ask him for revenge. Instead, she described Sita's beauty and lied that Lakshman cut off her nose when she tried to bring Sita to him. She then suggested Ravan kill Ram to take Sita as his wife, indicating a motivation of desire, not revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Treatment of Sita

It is sometimes claimed that Ravan treated Sita with dignity and respect despite kidnapping her, and did not force himself upon her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. However, detailed accounts in Valmiki's Ramayan (Aranya Kaand, Chapters 49-52, and Sundarkand 22:8 and 22:9) describe Ravan threatening Sita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. He gave her a two-month deadline to agree to become his wife, threatening to have her cooked for his breakfast if she refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This behavior is presented as far from respectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Ravan's Other Atrocities and Downfall

Ravan is depicted as committing numerous evil deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   He was responsible for Marich's death, forcing him to aid in Sita's kidnapping under threat of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   He mercilessly killed Jatayu, who tried to help Sita during the kidnapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Being a Shiv devotee did not nullify his crimes of murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   The claim that being a Brahmin implies good values is questioned, as Ravan's actions dishonored women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The text challenges judging people based on identity (tribe, faith, deity worship) rather than their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Role of [[the_addition_of_uttar_kand_to_the_original_ramayana | Uttarkand]]

Other atrocities committed by Ravan are detailed in [[the_addition_of_uttar_kand_to_the_original_ramayana | Uttarkand]], an epilogue to the Ramayan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While some scholars argue that Uttarkand was a later addition and not part of the original Ramayana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, its inclusion significantly magnifies Ravan's wrongdoings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. In Uttarkand, Ravan is described as:
*   Attacking his half-brother Kuber and stealing Lanka and the Pushpak Viman (flying chariot) from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   Killing a peace messenger sent by Kuber and having the demons eat the dead body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   Attacking King Marut's holy rites, killing monks, and drinking their blood (Uttarkand 18:20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
These accounts portray Ravan as a demonic murderer, robber, and even a cannibal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

It is important to note that Uttarkand also contains [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | accusations levied on Ram]], such as banishing Sita and killing Shambuk, a person from a so-called lower caste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Ravan's Death

Ravan's death in Valmiki's Ramayan (Yudhkand 108:16 and 108:17) describes Ram shooting a special arrow that hit Ravan's heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. There is no mention of a "pot of elixir in Ravan's stomach" or Ram needing to aim at his naval; this detail was added in later versions of the story, highlighting [[misinterpretations_and_later_additions_to_the_ramayana | later additions]] to the original text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

Even Ravan's own brother, Kumbhkaran, acknowledged Ravan's evil deeds and foretold his downfall (Yudhkand, chapter 63) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Kumbhkaran stated that those who do evil are sure to face a downfall and that Ravan's doom was before him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Despite knowing his evil, Kumbhkaran participated in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Ultimately, Lanka's destruction was not caused by Vibhishan's actions (who sided with Ram), but by the evil deeds of Ravan and Kumbhkaran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Ravan is considered a symbol of evil because of the many evil deeds he committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

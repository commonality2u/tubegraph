Singapore, once grappling with widespread issues like poverty, unemployment, high crime rates, and illiteracy in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, underwent a remarkable transformation to become one of the cleanest and greenest countries in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, with next to no corruption or other crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Focus on Cleanliness
[[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]], the first Prime Minister of Singapore, believed that cleanliness is the hallmark of civilisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. He launched a sustained effort to keep Singapore clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

> [!info] Keep Singapore Clean Campaign
> On October 1st, 1968, the Prime Minister launched a nationwide "Keep Singapore Clean Campaign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. This campaign was periodically in effect every two to three years between 1958 and 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. It was not a superficial event but a concrete initiative with multiple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

Key measures implemented included:
*   **Waste Collection**: Public waste collectors were licensed by the National Environment Agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   **Recycling Infrastructure**: Each public housing estate was equipped with blue recycling bins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Public Toilets**: A large number of public toilets were created, and programs like the "Happy Toilet Program" were run to ensure they were clean and well-maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Chewing Gum Ban**: In 1992, chewing gum was banned in Singapore, demonstrating a no-compromise stance on cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

### Strict Penalties
Major laws were enacted to levy heavy fines for actions that compromise cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>:
*   **First Offence**: S$1,000 for spitting, littering, or smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.
*   **Second Offence**: S$2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Third Offence**: S$5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Urban Planning and Beautification
Singapore also tackled the problem of widespread slums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a> and focused on comprehensive urban planning.
*   **Slum Clearance and Housing**: More than 26,000 families were relocated from slums to high-rise buildings and public housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. These new homes were provided with water, electricity, and gas supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. By 2021, approximately 80% of Singaporeans lived in government-provided public housing, leading to almost no homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **Organized Informal Economy**: Over 4,900 hawkers were relocated to food centres, and new wholesale markets were developed for vegetable sellers to organize the informal economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.
*   **River Cleaning and Environmental Relocation**: Pig farms and duck farms were phased out from catchment areas, and rivers were cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Additionally, more than 2,800 industries were relocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

## Environmental Initiatives
In 1972, the Singaporean government launched the "Tree Planting Day" initiative, where all residents came together to plant trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
*   **Successful Afforestation**: Within 10 years, the number of trees planted equaled the population of Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
*   **Clean Rivers**: Rivers were cleaned within 10 years of this initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
*   **Green City and Tourism**: Today, Singapore boasts some of the best indoor gardens, and its widespread greenery has become a significant tourist attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.

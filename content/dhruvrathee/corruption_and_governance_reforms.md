In a hypothetical scenario where Dhruv Rathee assumes the role of Prime Minister, a core focus would be on tackling corruption and implementing comprehensive governance reforms to ensure peace, prosperity, and the safety of every citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The prevailing mindset of colonialism and feudalism, which devalues the life of a common person compared to a dignitary, would be challenged and changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The aim is to uphold the Constitution's guarantee of equality and equal protection under the law for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## The Problem of Corruption

Corruption is identified as a significant obstacle to progress and safety in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. It is cited as the reason for fatalities due to illegally erected hoardings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a> and the circulation of adulterated medicines that pass safety checks due to bribery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Even cancer-causing chemicals found in spice mixes are attributed to food safety officials taking bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

### Root Causes of Corruption

Three main reasons are identified for the prevalence of corruption:
*   **Top-down Approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>: This is considered the biggest reason, forming an entire chain where lower-level officials pay their superiors, extending up to the Chief Minister or Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Breaking this chain requires pure intentions from the leader at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Overworked and Underpaid Personnel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>: Police officers and other government employees are often overworked, sometimes for 12 hours straight, and not paid properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This also applies to courts and judges, who are overburdened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
*   **Greed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>: This is considered the least significant reason. It is believed that solving the first two issues would make it easier to address greed through strict laws and harsh punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

## Proposed Governance Reforms

The proposed reforms focus on both **preventive solutions** (stopping problems before they occur) and **punitive solutions** (fighting existing problems and punishing perpetrators to discourage others) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Transparency and Accountability
A fundamental aspect of reform is to diagnose and accept problems rather than sweeping them under the carpet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Many politicians are criticized for ignoring issues and suppressing reports of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Under-reporting of crimes, especially against women, is a known issue according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The media would be encouraged to report freely on safety issues and crime incidents without fear of being labeled anti-national <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. A strong, unafraid media is deemed essential for a functioning democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

### Police and Judicial Reforms
*   **FIR Filing Mechanism**: If a local police station refuses to file an FIR, a facility would be established for complainants to file it directly at the SP's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. A departmental inquiry would also be initiated to investigate the police officer's refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This system has already been implemented in Rajasthan in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Increased Personnel**: To address understaffing and overburdening in the police force, the number of police personnel would be doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Similarly, the number of judges and courts would be increased to alleviate their workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **State-Level Investigating Agencies**: Recognizing the public's perception of state police's inability to investigate important cases, and the demand for CBI transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, every state would establish a CBI-type organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Investigating officers for each case would come from this specialized branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. This is part of broader [[systemic_issues_in_law_enforcement_and_governance | police reforms]].
*   **Respectful Conduct**: Police officers would be instructed to address every citizen as "Sir" or "Ma'am," regardless of their socio-economic status, to foster a change in mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

### Addressing Overwork and Underpayment
All police officers and government officials would receive good salaries, mental health care, medical insurance, life insurance, and family benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. A strict 8-hour workday limit would be implemented for all, with sufficient force to manage the workload and fill all vacancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### Funding Reforms
Funds for these reforms would come from:
*   **Increased Corporate Tax**: Raising corporate tax to its 2017-18 levels could generate an additional ₹1 Trillion for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   **Budget Reallocation**: Money allocated for highway construction (approx. ₹2 trillion) would be reallocated, given that only 8% of Indian families own cars, and 50% use cycles, bikes, or scooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. This money would be better invested in education and building cities for humans, not cars, which would also reduce pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Ending Corruption**: Eliminating corruption at all levels would free up significant funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

## Vision for India

By implementing these preventive and punitive solutions, the vision is to create an India that is not only safe and secure for every Indian but also for every foreigner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. The goal is for India to rise to rank 1 on the Global Peace Index, becoming the world's most peaceful and prosperous country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

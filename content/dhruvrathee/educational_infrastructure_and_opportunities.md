Unemployment has emerged as a significant issue in India, with one out of three youths being unemployed, according to the India Employment Report 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The unemployment rate for graduates specifically reached 29.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite India being the 5th largest economy, there is a severe shortage of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A major contributing factor to this crisis is the state of the country's educational infrastructure and the limited opportunities it provides.

## The Problem with Current Educational Infrastructure

India's educational system faces significant challenges in accommodating the large number of students seeking higher education and vocational training.

### Lack of Seats for Higher Education
Approximately 28.5 million students enroll in higher secondary schools annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Including dropouts, the total number of students eligible for higher education is estimated to be between 33 million and 34 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. However, the existing colleges across the country cannot accommodate this vast number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

#### Medical Education
As of July 2023, there were only about 108,000 MBBS seats and approximately 140,000 total MBBS plus BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) seats nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. In contrast, over 2 million applications were received for NEET UG in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, meaning only 1 out of 15 aspiring doctors secures a seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This highlights a severe shortage of doctors, not a lack of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The problem is exacerbated by the high fees in private medical colleges, which constitute half of all medical seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The median fee in private medical colleges is ₹1.15 million per year, totaling nearly ₹6 million for a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. For Deemed Universities, the median fee is even higher at ₹2.1 million per year, exceeding ₹10 million for the full degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Given that 90% of Indians earn less than ₹25,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, these fees are largely unaffordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

#### Engineering Education
Despite a growing population, the total number of seats in engineering colleges has decreased over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. From 1.465 million seats in 2017-18, it fell to about 1.253 million in 2021-22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Furthermore, a significant number of seats remain vacant (33% in 2021-22, approximately 421,000 seats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Four main reasons contribute to this:
1.  **High Fees**: Fees at institutions, including IITs, have increased significantly, with a 4-year B.Tech degree costing an additional ₹800,000 in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Private engineering colleges can charge up to ₹2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
2.  **Low Quality of Education**: Many private engineering colleges have sub-standard faculties who are either poorly paid or unqualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. In June 2023, Ministry of Education data showed that only 44.51% of engineering college faculty held PhDs, and 55.49% held Master's degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
3.  **Shortage of Faculty**: In December 2022, it was reported that 4,500 faculty posts were vacant in prestigious IITs, and overall, 40.3% of teaching positions were vacant in 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
4.  **Inadequate Infrastructure**: Many colleges lack proper infrastructure. AICTE reduced 40,000 seats in government engineering colleges in 2019 due to lack of faculty or infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. In Tamil Nadu, over 50% of engineering colleges lacked adequate infrastructure in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

As a result, most engineering graduates are not employable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. A 2019 report revealed that 60% of engineering graduates do not do an internship, and only about 3% possess new-age technological skills in fields like AI, machine learning, and data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Ultimately, over 80% of Indian engineers are not employable, not due to laziness, but due to systemic issues in the educational infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This highlights a critical need for [[educational_background_and_interest_in_engineering | improved engineering education]].

#### Vocational Training (ITIs)
Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) offer skills training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. In December 2022, there were around 15,000 ITIs with a total seating capacity of about 2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Even when combining seats from medical, engineering, and ITI courses, the total capacity is under 5 million, significantly less than the 30 million eligible students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Like engineering colleges, about 50% of ITI seats are vacant, and most graduates are not employable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## Government's Role and Solutions

The government plays a crucial role in addressing the unemployment crisis through targeted interventions in education and employment.

### Unfulfilled Promises and Criticisms
Prime Minister Modi had previously promised millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, launching initiatives like "Make in India" to provide local employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. However, some media channels have "fact-checked" these claims, stating no specific job targets were promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Despite the promises, unemployment rates have surged, with Haryana, for example, recording the highest unemployment at 37.4% in December 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Some media figures blame citizens for seeking government jobs due to desires for bribes or easy work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, and for not being "skilled enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This implicitly questions the efficacy of government initiatives like Skill India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Necessary Government Actions
To address unemployment, the government must take several steps:

1.  **Fill Vacancies**: The central government has over 950,000 job vacancies, and state governments report over 6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Filling these would provide immediate employment.
2.  **Focus on Education**: There is a dire need for [[improving_mental_health_and_education_infrastructure | improved infrastructure]] in government schools, colleges, and institutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. New educational institutions need to be established to increase seats for aspiring engineers and doctors, bridging the demand-supply gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
3.  **Promote Cooperatives and Small Enterprises**: The government should actively promote cooperative models (like Amul and Lijjat Papad) and small and micro enterprises, which are significant job creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Unlike large corporations that contribute minimally to employment despite massive turnovers, these sectors provide widespread job creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. This means providing not just loans but also means of production, storage space, and market mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Historical examples like the Great Depression recovery in America, Mao Zedong's efforts in China, and Singapore's development in the 1960s show the effectiveness of government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. India's own history with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru setting up public sector undertakings and nationalizing banks, and the White Revolution through government intervention, demonstrates this capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. The development of Hyderabad as an IT hub is another example of successful government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
4.  **Support Small Businesses**: While the Prime Minister may suggest self-employment like street food stalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, the government needs to genuinely support them by controlling costs (e.g., gas cylinders, oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a> and encouraging their growth instead of reducing corporate taxes for large businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

## Individual Actions for Skill Development

While waiting for government action, individuals can take proactive steps to improve their employment prospects.

1.  **Learn a Skill**: Acquire any skill, whether it's cooking for a cloud kitchen, baking, or setting up a small stall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
2.  **Seek Practical Experience**: If hesitant to start a business, work with another salesperson, learn jewellery design, or work with a handicraft worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This aligns with the concept of [[alternative_employment_opportunities_and_skill_development | alternative employment opportunities]].
3.  **Be Sincere and Dedicated**: No work is insignificant if done with sincerity. Initial low pay can be treated as an internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. Developing confidence through work can lead to starting one's own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

Ultimately, the problem is not a lack of skilled people but a shortage of jobs and inadequate educational and vocational training infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Both governmental policy changes and individual initiatives are crucial for addressing this complex issue.

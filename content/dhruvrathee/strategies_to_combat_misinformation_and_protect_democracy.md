The prevalence of intense, sometimes irrational, political support highlights a concerning trend of widespread public [[election_strategies_and_brainwashing_tactics | brainwashing]] across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This phenomenon leads individuals to make extreme sacrifices for their preferred political figures, even when confronted with undeniable economic hardships or a lack of demonstrable achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

Instead of dismissing those affected as "blind devotees," there is a need to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to such mental enslavement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Unity within society, rather than division, is essential to address this issue and move the country forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## The Rise of WhatsApp University

A significant contributor to this widespread [[election_strategies_and_brainwashing_tactics | brainwashing]] is identified as "WhatsApp University" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This informal network circulates messages that are not only false but often dangerously misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Why WhatsApp is More Dangerous than Mainstream Media

Unlike pro-government media anchors who face accountability through police cases and FIRs for spreading [[claims_of_spreading_hatred_and_misinformation | fake news]] or inciting discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>, [[whatsapp_misinformation_and_its_impact_on_society | WhatsApp misinformation]] operates without such fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. The anonymity and forward-chain nature of WhatsApp messages make it nearly impossible to trace the original source, thus preventing legal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. However, when authorities choose to act, as seen in cases like the murder of Mohammad Azam due to a fake child kidnapping rumour, the source can indeed be traced and action taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

### The Role of the BJP IT Cell

The primary reason this "factory of lies" on WhatsApp remains unchecked is its alleged operation by the BJP IT cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. An employee of the BJP IT cell described their team's main task as commenting to defame others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Political leaders have openly acknowledged their capability to circulate any message, true or false, to millions via WhatsApp groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. This includes promoting [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | propaganda films]] like "The Kerala Story," despite their claims being debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

## The Four-Pronged Strategy of Misinformation (WhatsApp Mafia)

The WhatsApp mafia targets the majority community, typically upper-caste Hindus, to gain control, drawing parallels with historical dictatorships that aimed to [[election_strategies_and_brainwashing_tactics | brainwash]] their majority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. This strategy involves four key departments:

### 1. Racial or Religious Pride
The initial phase involves instilling a sense of pride in one's race or religion, promoting the idea of a glorious past and superior culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. This often involves propagating pseudo-scientific claims, such as the healing properties of rituals or the idea that ancient scriptures contained cures for modern diseases, without any factual basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. The aim is to encourage people to switch off their critical thinking and accept messages without verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

### 2. Victimisation and Self-Pity
Once pride is established, narratives of victimisation are introduced, claiming that the group has suffered centuries of oppression and has been prevented from succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

### 3. The "You Are in Danger" Narrative
Following victimisation, constant messages are circulated to instill fear, suggesting that the group is still in danger from "people of other religions" and anyone who opposes the ruling party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

### 4. The Cult of Personality (Modi)
Finally, with fear ingrained, a leader is presented as the sole saviour, transforming them into a divine or infallible figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Ahead of elections, messages become more active, framing votes for the ruling party as essential for the community's survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

### Historical Parallels
These [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | propaganda techniques]] mirror those used by dictators such as Hitler, who first fostered racial pride among German Aryans, then painted them as victims, declared them in danger from Jews, and finally presented himself as the supreme saviour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. This historical context reveals how similar emotional manipulation can lead to widespread [[election_strategies_and_brainwashing_tactics | brainwashing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.

## Combating Misinformation: A Call to Action

To counter this "WhatsApp mafia" and protect democracy, a multi-faceted approach is proposed:

### United Front Against Misinformation
There are reportedly about 10,000 individuals in the BJP IT cell running this misinformation network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20:00">[27:20:00]</a>. A larger, united front of citizens is needed to counteract their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>.

### Individual Actions
1.  **Join and Share:** Join trusted WhatsApp channels for factual information and forward daily messages to a wide network of contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:43:00">[27:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Download Backup Apps:** Install backup applications (e.g., Dhruv Rathee app) as a failsafe if main channels are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:00">[28:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32:00">[28:32:00]</a>.
3.  **Create Debunking Content:** Record and share short videos (1-minute long) that debunk false narratives using hashtags like #Mission100Crore on social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:00">[28:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>. This amplifies the truth and challenges the "factory of lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:59:00">[28:59:00]</a>.

### Protecting Democracy
The ultimate goal is to educate the one billion voters in the country about the importance of protecting the Constitution and democracy, and to free them from mental slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:22:00">[29:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>. This effort is seen as a duty, echoing the struggles of historical figures who fought for India's freedom and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.
Voting is identified as a crucial step in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>.

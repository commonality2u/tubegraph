The integrity of examinations in India has faced significant challenges, particularly highlighted by the recent [[neet_2024_exam_irregularities_and_fraud | NEET]] pre-medical exam results, which caused nationwide commotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While 2.3 million students appeared for this exam, the implications extend to every student in the country who expects a fair chance at a bright future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Impact on Students

The high pressure and tough competition in India's education system, coupled with a shortage of seats in good colleges, make fair exams crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. When exams are not conducted properly, it shatters the hopes of students who study hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Students, often 16-17 years old, dedicate an entire year to preparing for a single exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. News of scams and irregularities can render all their hard work wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This frustration and disappointment can have severe consequences; in 2022, over 13,000 students committed suicide due to depression related to the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

It is advised that students always have a Plan B and Plan C in life, and not bet their entire future on one exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Impact on the Education System

### Commonality of Irregularities
[[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | Paper leaks]] and misconduct in exams have become increasingly common in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Patna police, for instance, arrested 13 people for leaking exam papers, charging students ₹3 million to ₹5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. A racket was busted in Gujarat where an education consultancy owner, a school teacher, and a BJP leader charged ₹1 million for exam assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Investigations by the Indian Express revealed 41 paper leaks in the last five years, affecting 14 million job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### NEET 2024 Exam Irregularities
The declaration of [[neet_2024_exam_irregularities_and_fraud | NEET results]] on June 4th, 2024, exposed "unbelievable irregularities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>:

*   **Unprecedented Perfect Scores**: 67 students scored a perfect 720 out of 720, achieving All India Rank 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This is significantly higher than previous years, where only 2 perfect scores were recorded in 2023, and 4 in 2022 (none with full marks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Contradictory Justifications for Scores**:
    *   The [[Issues with National Testing Agency NTA | National Testing Agency (NTA)]] initially claimed the exam was "very easy," contradicting student and expert predictions of a tough paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   The NTA also cited a higher number of candidates (300,000 more than 2023) as a reason for higher scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Grace Marks Controversy**:
    *   50 out of 67 toppers received grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   44 students received grace marks due to discrepancies in answer keys, notably for a physics question with two correct answers depending on the NCERT textbook edition (old vs. new) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This raises questions about the competence of a national exam body that cannot get questions right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
    *   The remaining 6 students received grace marks due to time-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. These 6, along with other students, were from the same Jhajjar Centre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
    *   Scores like 718 or 719, which are technically impossible under the scoring system (+4 for correct, -1 for incorrect), were reported for some students, indicating the impact of grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   The NTA justified grace marks by citing a 2018 Supreme Court judgment related to the CLAT law exam, which explicitly stated it could *not* be applied to engineering and medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **OMR Sheet Discrepancies**: Many students found significant differences between their OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) answer sheets and their final scorecards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. For example, 18-year-old Arshita's score dropped from an expected 384 to 308 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### Strategic Result Declaration
The NEET results were declared 10 days earlier than expected, on June 4th, coinciding with the 2024 General Election results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This timing led to accusations of attempting to cover up a scam amidst the media frenzy surrounding the elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Lack of Accountability
The [[Issues with National Testing Agency NTA | National Testing Agency (NTA)]], established in 2017 under the [[role_of_indian_government_and_education_ministry_in_exam_management | Ministry of Education of India]] to ensure transparency, has become a target of public anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The [[role_of_indian_government_and_education_ministry_in_exam_management | Education Minister, Dharmendra Pradhan]], despite being reappointed, has been criticized for focusing more on political PR than on addressing educational issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This lack of accountability at the leadership level contributes to the mismanagement of the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Addressing the Problem

The widespread issues led to protests and demands for re-examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The Supreme Court intervened, stating that "the sanctity of the exam has been affected" and demanded answers from the NTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Opposition leaders also demanded an investigation and promised to raise the issue in Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

Under pressure, the NTA announced on June 8th that the [[role_of_indian_government_and_education_ministry_in_exam_management | Education Ministry]] would establish a 4-member panel to examine the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. As a latest update, the NTA has agreed to remove grace marks, offering the 1,563 affected candidates the option to retake the exam or accept their original scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. However, the NTA has yet to provide answers for other significant issues like paper leaks, inflated scores, and multiple toppers from the same centre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

Despite these challenges, collective voice and sustained pressure are seen as crucial for reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

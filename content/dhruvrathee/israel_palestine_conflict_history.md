A new conflict erupted between Israel and Palestine on the morning of October 7th, at 6:30 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This surprise attack is considered the largest in recent decades in the [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Israel-Palestine conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## The October 2023 Surprise Attack

While most Israelis were asleep, air raid sirens began to blare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Shortly after, thousands of rockets were fired at Israeli cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The Israeli Defence Forces estimated 2,200 rockets, while Hamas claimed 5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Israel's Iron Dome system, considered one of the world's best air defense systems designed to intercept rockets mid-flight, failed when faced with 5,000 rockets fired within 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This led to thousands of people being killed and injured in Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Multi-Pronged Offensive

In addition to rocket strikes, Hamas launched a multi-pronged attack from ground, sea, and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   The boundary wall on the Israel-Gaza border was broken down by a bulldozer, allowing Palestinians to enter Israeli territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Some entered on motorcycles, others used motor-powered hang-gliders to enter through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Hamas also attacked from the sea using speedboats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Key events included an attack on a military base on the Israel-Gaza border, the capture of an Israeli tank, and the capture of many Israeli soldiers held hostage by Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Armed Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israeli villages and cities near the border, resulting in many innocent civilian deaths and hostage-takings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Hamas's military commander, Mohammad Al-Deif, named this attack "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood," stating it was a response to Israeli "atrocities on the Palestinians" and specifically to events at the Al-Aqsa mosque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Israeli Response: Operation Iron Swords

In response, Israel declared a state of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> and launched its own attack named "Operation Iron Swords" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) deployed their Navy, Air Force, and Ground Forces, and launched drone strikes in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Israel's Energy Minister signed an order to cut electricity supply to Gaza, which largely received its electricity from Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated, "Citizens of Israel, we are at war," vowing that "the enemy will have to pay an unprecedented price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The defense minister declared that Hamas "made a huge mistake" and Israel "will win this war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

The IDF carried out airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in thousands of Palestinian deaths and injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Israel claims to issue warnings before airstrikes, such as a 10-minute warning before striking a 14-story building in Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, or a 15-minute warning in August 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. However, many Palestinian civilians have been killed in these Israeli airstrikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Geographical and Political Landscape

Israel and Palestine are located in the Middle East, bordered by Lebanon to the North, Syria to the Northeast, Jordan to the East, Egypt to the Southwest, and the Mediterranean Sea to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The Palestinian territories are divided into two parts:
*   **The West Bank**: Located west of Jordan, it contains many Israeli settlements that are under Israeli control and considered illegal by the United Nations and many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The West Bank is administered by Palestinian Authorities under the control of Fatah, a political party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **The Gaza Strip**: Located southwest of Israel and bordering Egypt, it is controlled independently by Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

There has been a separate historical conflict between Fatah and Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, as well as a historical conflict between Fatah and Hamas more recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Hamas: Designated Terrorist Organization

Hamas is an extremist Palestinian organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   It is designated as a terrorist organization by most countries, including Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, Australia, the USA, and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Conversely, Brazil, China, Egypt, [[iran_and_israel_conflict_and_missile_attacks | Iran]], Norway, Qatar, Russia, Syria, and Turkey do not consider it a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   Some countries, like New Zealand and Paraguay, consider only Hamas's military wing as a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. These geopolitical stances influence how countries react to the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Historical Context and Parallels

The current surprise attack harks back to the Yom Kippur War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Exactly 50 years prior, in October 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a similar surprise attack on Israel, leading to the Yom Kippur War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This attack is described as "no less than a full-scale war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

A more detailed historical context of the [[israels_military_response_and_international_reactions | Israel-Palestine conflict]] involves understanding how Jews, persecuted in Europe for centuries, migrated to Palestine to save their lives, leading to Palestinians becoming refugees in their own country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Intelligence Failures

A significant talking point in this conflict is the apparent failure of Mossad, Israel's world-famous intelligence agency, to intercept this attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Despite being considered one of the most powerful intelligence agencies with informants in Palestinian military groups and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, questions are being raised about how they did not know thousands of rockets were being stockpiled in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The Gaza-Israel border fencing, equipped with cameras, ground motion sensors, and regular army patrols, also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Domestically, the Israeli government faces criticism, with former head of the Israeli Navy calling it a "huge failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. A major investigation into this [[controversies_and_failures_of_israeli_intelligence | intelligence failure]] has begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Allegedly, Egyptian intelligence officials had repeatedly warned Israel of an impending major event, but these warnings were ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | International Reactions]]

*   **United States**: President Joe Biden condemned the attack and expressed "rock-solid and unwavering support" for Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **European Union**: The foreign policy chief strongly condemned the attack, affirming Israel's right to defend itself under international law and demanding the immediate release of Israeli hostages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Iran**: A main supporter of Hamas, Iran's foreign ministry stated that Hamas's attack was an act of "self-defence by the Palestinians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Egypt**: Egypt's foreign ministry is in talks with Saudi Arabia and Jordan to de-escalate [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Israeli-Palestinian tensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Palestine (Palestinian Authority)**: President Mahmoud Abbas stated that Palestinians have the right to protect themselves against "the terror of the settlers and foreign troops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **India**: Historically, India has supported the Palestinian cause of self-determination under various Prime Ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Prime Minister Modi, the first Indian PM to visit Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, expressed shock at the terrorist attacks and solidarity with Israel and its victims, viewing Hamas's actions as terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations

The speaker emphasizes that while the Palestinian cause deserves support, it should not be through supporting terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. The actions of Hamas, including disturbing videos of treatment towards women and civilians, are condemned as terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. While there has been injustice against common Palestinians, killing common people in Israel cannot be justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

Israel, as a powerful country with a democratic government, is urged to use its powers responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. The speaker calls for empathy for ordinary Israeli and Palestinian families who live in fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>, warning against those who celebrate the eradication of either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

The war is expected to continue for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. For a detailed understanding of the historical context and reasons behind the Israel-Palestine conflict, a previous video is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

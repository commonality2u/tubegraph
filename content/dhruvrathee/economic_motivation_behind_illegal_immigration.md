Illegal immigration, particularly through methods like the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_india | 'donkey process']], is often driven by a desperate pursuit of economic opportunity and a better life. Many individuals, especially from villages like Dingucha in Gujarat, leave their homes and countries due to a lack of jobs and dire financial circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Cost of the Journey

The journey, often facilitated by [[role_of_visa_agencies_in_illegal_immigration | visa agencies]], can be incredibly expensive and risky. For example, the Patel family from Dingucha paid ₹6.5 million (approximately $78,000 USD) to an agent for their journey to America via the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_india | 'donkey process']] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This substantial sum was raised despite Jagdish Patel earning only ₹9,000 - ₹10,000 monthly as a former teacher turned garment business helper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The family was motivated by poverty and unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, with Vaishali Ben dreaming of working in a beauty salon and Jagdish hoping for better education for his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Agencies charge anywhere from ₹2.5 million to ₹6 million for their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. To afford these exorbitant fees, individuals often resort to selling their farms, homes, or depleting their entire life savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Primary Economic Motivations

Three main reasons underpin the decision to embark on this perilous journey:

### 1. Pursuit of Economic Opportunities and the "American Dream"
Many believe that once they reach countries like America, their lives will significantly improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This belief in the "American Dream" is a powerful motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. While the upper and upper-middle classes might share similar aspirations, they typically have access to legal avenues like job applications abroad or foreign university admissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. However, those from the lower-middle class often lack the financial resources or educational qualifications required for legal visas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

Success stories, like that of Mitesh Trivedi, an engineer who left India for Canada 30 years ago due to career stagnation and lower-middle-class origins, further fuel this motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. His eventual Canadian citizenship and profitable restaurant inspire others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Such stories can create societal pressure, where having a family member settled abroad becomes a matter of reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### 2. Rising Unemployment in the Home Country
A significant driver for illegal immigration is high unemployment rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Haryana, for instance, held the highest unemployment rate in India in September 2022, at 37.3%, four times the national average, with a notable prevalence in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Faced with such dire conditions, individuals view this life-threatening path as a better alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Villages in Jind district like Dhatrath, Morkhi, and Kalwa have become focal points for those seeking the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_india | 'donkey process']] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

Nishchay Sharma, a young man from Haryana with a weak educational background, resorted to the "Donkey Flight" after failing to secure a student or job visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. He traveled through nine countries, enduring jungles and extreme weather, to reach California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Dangers Despite Economic Drivers

Despite the clear economic motivations, the journey itself is fraught with danger, as highlighted by the tragic death of the Patel family who froze to death 12 meters from the US-Canada border due to -35°C temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The [[risks_and_dangers_of_the_usmexico_border_crossing | US-Mexico border crossing]] presents even greater hazards, including the Darien Gap jungle, which is controlled by drug cartels and guerrilla groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, leading to violence, imprisonment, and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. In 2021 alone, over 650 people died attempting to cross the US-Mexico border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

<p>Individuals who fall prey to [[role_of_visa_agencies_in_illegal_immigration | visa agencies]] may not realize that regular visa fees are never this high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. These agencies often mislead people with false promises of smooth journeys and abundant job opportunities, concealing the real challenges and legal hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.</p>

Ultimately, while the desire for economic betterment is a powerful driving force, the risks involved in illegal immigration routes are immense and often fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

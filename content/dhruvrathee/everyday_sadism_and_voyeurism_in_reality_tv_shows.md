The claim of popular YouTuber Dhruv Rathee making a wildcard entry into Bigg Boss OTT 2 was widely published by various media houses, including India TV, India Times, ABP News, India Today, Zoom TV, Pinkvilla, and Economic Times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, Dhruv Rathee confirmed that this news was false; he had not been asked to join Bigg Boss this season, nor had he expressed a desire to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This incident highlights the standard of some Indian media, which publishes unverified information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The Economic Times article even included a disclaimer, shifting responsibility for content verification onto the reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Dhruv Rathee unequivocally stated that he would never participate in a show like Bigg Boss, regardless of the financial compensation, deeming it a "nonsense show" and a "very cheap way to earn money and fame" that has a negative [[impact_of_reality_tv_shows_on_society_and_mental_health | impact on society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Origin of Bigg Boss

The concept of "Big Brother" originated in the Netherlands in 1999, inspired by George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel *1984* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Orwell's book warned of a dictatorial government with an omnipresent "Big Brother" constantly watching citizens, using surveillance, propaganda, and manipulation to control people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The TV show adopted a similar premise, with participants living under constant surveillance and Big Brother's command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This concept became globally popular, leading to adaptations like India's Bigg Boss, which launched in various languages and later on OTT platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Ironically, while Orwell's novel served as a warning against authoritarian control, shows like Big Brother and Bigg Boss provide "the cheapest form of entertainment" by exploiting "everyday sadism and voyeurism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Everyday Sadism

Sadism is defined as "the tendency to derive pleasure from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Psychological studies have identified a less extreme category called "Everyday Sadism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### Examples of Everyday Sadism

*   **Ancient Roman Colosseum**: Audiences found entertainment in gladiators' suffering, even voting to kill injured fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Street Fights**: Many people gather to watch and enjoy street fights rather than intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Bullying**: Individuals who enjoy humiliating others in schools or colleges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Animal Cruelty**: People who kick or throw stones at animals for pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Workplace Harassment**: A boss who constantly criticizes an employee not for work improvement, but for the pleasure of inflicting mental pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Mob Lynching**: Crowds engaging in violence, often rationalizing their actions but deriving sadistic pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Political Binarism**: Celebrating the death of political opponents, demonstrating sadistic pleasure in another's suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Online Content**: Entire YouTube channels dedicated to insulting, abusing, or bullying others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Violent Video Games & Torture Films**: Studies show everyday sadists prefer violent video games, and films like *Saw* or *Human Centipede* exploit this tendency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Everyday Sadism in Bigg Boss
Reality TV shows like Bigg Boss actively exploit and appease Everyday Sadism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The show's formula thrives on conflict and humiliation:
*   **Constant Fights**: Contestants are frequently involved in physical altercations, throwing objects, or even hot water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Torture Tasks**: Contestants are given "tasks" designed to humiliate, such as throwing chili powder on faces, bathing in cow dung, or drinking from a dog bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Personal Revelations & Humiliation**: Contestants reveal personal matters, often leading to tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Body Shaming & Backbiting**: Criticism of physical appearance and "backbiting" are crucial components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **[[misogyny_and_objectification_in_media | Misogyny]] and Homophobia**: These elements are regularly featured, along with incidents like mixing soap in water or breaking into washrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Toxic Relationships**: Both real and fake toxic relationships are presented to boost TRP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Voyeurism

Voyeurism is defined as "taking cheap pleasure in watching other people's lives" or "enjoying closely watching what happens in other people's private lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Examples of Everyday Voyeurism

*   **MMS Leaks**: People actively search for leaked private content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Daily Vlogs**: Viewers derive entertainment from watching mundane aspects of YouTubers' personal lives, such as waking up, brushing teeth, or shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Some YouTubers exploit this by filming personal family moments, like a child crying or a fight, for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **CCTV Footage**: People enjoy watching CCTV footage of crimes, accidents, or other incidents, which media houses often broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Voyeurism in Bigg Boss
Bigg Boss heavily exploits Everyday Voyeurism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   **Extensive Surveillance**: Bigg Boss 16 had 98 cameras inside the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **24x7 Live Feeds**: Audiences can watch contestants live 24/7 through multiple camera feeds, allowing them to indulge in voyeuristic pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Public Confessions**: Contestants are encouraged to share their personal secrets on national television for content and TRP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## The [[the_artificial_and_scripted_nature_of_bigg_boss | Artificial and Scripted Nature]] of "Reality" TV

Despite being marketed as "reality" TV, much of Bigg Boss is manipulated:
*   **Self-Conscious Behavior**: Contestants are aware of constant surveillance, preventing natural behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Artificial Conflict**: The show creates a competitive environment and forces setups to generate arguments and fights, which are termed "performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **No Auditions**: Contestants are handpicked by producers based on their potential to create intrigue, not through open auditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   **Heavy Editing**: Hours of footage are condensed into short episodes, with specific moments selected and edited to portray misunderstandings, controversies, or even misrepresent interactions, as stated by contestants like Shweta Tiwari, Aashka Goradia, and Hina Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. For example, Aashka Goradia claimed editors made her look like a lesbian by selectively showing her applying balm to another contestant's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Producer Control**: The show's makers decide eliminations, contestant re-entries, and wild-card entries based on "saleability" and TRP, not solely public voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.
*   **Scripted Segments**: Shekhar Suman, a host for a Bigg Boss 16 special episode, admitted he followed a script provided by the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **Pre-planned Deals**: Some contestants, like Aman Verma, had pre-planned deals with producers regarding their duration in the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.
*   **Content Prerequisites**: Contestants like Shilpa Saklani noted that while not fully scripted, everyone knows they must "react and give content, to fight with each other, to put across their point of view, and to be assertive" to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

Intellectual discussions, social issues, philosophy, or science are absent from these shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. The focus remains on conflict, personal lives, backbiting, and insultsâ€”a "cocktail of Everyday Sadism and Voyeurism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

## [[impact_of_reality_tv_shows_on_society_and_mental_health | Impact on Viewers and Contestants]]

Watching such reality TV shows can have negative consequences:
*   **Increased Aggression in Viewers**: Psychologist Brian Gibson's study at Central Michigan University found that watching reality TV shows leads to increased aggression in viewers, even more so than violent media or crime TV shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Normalization**: Psychiatrist Dr. Marcia Sirota states that similar to junk food affecting physical health, bad reality TV makes viewers ruder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. When viewers see celebrities gaining fame and wealth by abusing others or behaving as "self-serving egoistics," they may adopt this perception as a viable path to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Mental Health Issues for Contestants**: Many former contestants have reported experiencing significant [[media_portrayal_of_mental_illnesses | mental health issues]] after the show, requiring therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
    *   Contestants often regret revealing personal secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
    *   Producers can manipulate public perception, unfairly turning contestants into villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
    *   The intense public criticism post-show can cause severe anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
    *   Examples include Shamita Shetty, Sana Khan, Kushal Tandon, Nikki Tamboli, Kavita Kaushik, Shalin Bhanot, Rahul Vaidya, Himanshi Khurana, Apurva Agnihotri, and Shilpa Shaklani, all of whom sought therapy after participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

It is crucial for individuals to choose content wisely and consider the impact of entertainment on their mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

The content creator celebrated reaching 10 million subscribers, an "unbelievable number" equivalent to the population of countries like Switzerland or Norway, by sharing personal stories from his past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Early Life and Childhood Interests

Born in Rohtak, Haryana, in October 1994, to a middle-class family, the creator's parents were a teacher and an engineer earning about ₹4,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. His maternal grandfather worked in the BSF, which led to significant travel during his infancy, captured in photos from Srinagar to Jaisalmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

His earliest memories are from Rohtak, playing by the lake and at his paternal grandparents' home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Around 2002-2003, his parents moved to Delhi for better job opportunities, increasing their combined salary to about ₹17,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. In 2003, his father moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for an even better job, though the family remained in Delhi due to living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This allowed the creator to visit Malaysia annually, marking his first foreign trip in the summer of 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. During this trip, the family acquired their first digital camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. He also discovered Lego, which would later have a significant impact on his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

### First Foray into Video Making

At 8-9 years old in 2003, he made his first video using a new computer webcam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. He learned that taking 24 photos in succession could create a 1-second video, grasping the concept of frame rates (24fps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This revelation led him to create "Claymation" films by moving clay characters incrementally and capturing photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

### Influences and Hobbies

*   **Comics and Cartoons**: He enjoyed reading comics, particularly Tinkle, and watching cartoons like Popeye, which instilled an "obsession with eating healthy," promoting spinach and vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. He notes a concern about modern cartoons promoting unhealthy food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. He stopped drinking soft drinks like Pepsi and Coca-Cola at 12 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   **Reading**: Around 14-15 years old (2008), reading became a passion, specifically Satyajit Ray's Feluda detective series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. This inspired him to want to be a criminal investigator or detective, a dream that faded upon realizing modern detectives were not like those in novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
*   **Robotics**: Around the same time, he developed an interest in mechanical robots, particularly Lego blocks that could be programmed with sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. He spent hours building and programming his own robot to carry a digital camera and change direction upon hitting objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. He emphasizes that he was an above-average student (70%-80% marks) and believes anyone given such toys and enough time could build similar things, especially without the distractions of [[Social responsibility among influencers | social media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   **Television Programs**: By 2010, he aspired to be a host on National Geographic or Discovery Channel, admiring shows like Bear Grylls' "Man vs. Wild" and travel programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. He notes he is fortunate to be doing something similar on his vlog channel today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

## Entry into Politics and YouTube

*   **Political Awakening**: In December 2011, the creator's interest in politics began with the anti-corruption [[Activism and raising political awareness through social media | protests]] led by Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal, which received positive media coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. He highlights his lack of family connection to politics, refuting misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   **Deepening Interest**: His interest deepened after 2012-2013 with the formation of the AAP government in Delhi and when [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Narendra Modi]] became Prime Minister in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Initially delighted by the Congress government's loss, his ideology was "100% anti-Congress," driven by media narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   **Disillusionment and First YouTube Upload**: Within months, he realized the "misdirections" as promises like black money repatriation weren't fulfilled, RTI was diluted, and foreign funding for political parties was legalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. Frustrated, he published his initial videos on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. His very first video uploaded in 2014 was a travel vlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

## Educational Journey and Career Philosophy

*   **12th Grade Philosophy**: After completing his 12th board exams in 2012 with 85%, he subconsciously applied the "80-20 rule" to his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. He aimed for a good enough score (around 80%) to be considered a capable student, rather than striving for 100% perfection, which he believed required disproportionate effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.
*   **Post-12th Decisions**: He took various college admission tests (Manipal University, IIT, JEE) but did not secure admission to top institutions, admitting the 80-20 philosophy wasn't ideal for IIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.
*   **Desire for Army**: His first choice was to join the Indian Air Force or Army due to the adventurous nature of the work compared to "boring" office jobs, and because several relatives were in the Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>.
    *   **NDA Interview Experience**: After passing the NDA written test, he attended the SSB interview in Varanasi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Despite confidence in the physical test, he struggled in the group debate, being unable to voice his points effectively due to his slow speaking style, which ultimately led to his failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.
*   **Studying Abroad**: His parents encouraged studying abroad rather than a "C-grade" Indian engineering college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. They chose Germany due to its almost free tuition compared to expensive English-speaking countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.
    *   He secured admission to Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany (and Eindhoven University in Netherlands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. He credits this to luck (less competition in 2012 for foreign applicants) and foreign universities' focus on other skills, hobbies, and experiences over marks, possibly including his interest in Lego robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.
    *   He moved to Germany at 17 in August 2012 to study Mechanical Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>, a choice influenced by childhood interest in robotics and the common advice to pursue engineering if unsure of a career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. He completed his Bachelor's in 2015 and Master's in Renewable Engineering from Karlsruhe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

## YouTube as a Career

*   **Inception**: His fascination with YouTube began in 2014, a few months after meeting his now-wife Juli during an internship commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>. Having been interested in making videos since childhood, he started regularly uploading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Challenges**: By 2017, despite crossing 50,000 subscribers, his parents didn't believe YouTube could be a viable career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. He himself initially doubted it would generate a respectable income, so he continued his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.
*   **Commitment and Growth**: After 2017-2018, he made YouTube his number one priority, with education as number two, driven by his passion and belief in its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>. He emphasizes that passion makes consistency and discipline easier, though effort and hard work are still necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.
*   **Philosophy of Excellence**: Citing the dialogue from *3 Idiots*, he states he never focused on subscriber numbers but instead on continuously improving himself, video quality, and message delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>.
*   **Time Management Course**: He mentions his course on Time Management, sharing practical techniques from his experience on how he manages his channels and travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

On the night of May 18, 2024, a tragic accident occurred in Pune, Maharashtra, involving an underage driver in a Porsche Taycan that resulted in the deaths of two individuals. The incident and its aftermath sparked widespread public outrage due to alleged attempts at cover-ups, preferential treatment, and the initial lenient bail conditions granted to the accused.

## The Night of the Accident

On the night of May 18, 2024, Aneesh, 24, and Ashwini, 24, from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, were working in an IT company in Pune and were partying with friends at the Ballr club in Pune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Meanwhile, Vedant, who is under the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, met 12 friends at a pub called Cosie, located 3 km from Ballr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Vedant and his friends entered Cosie at 10:40 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> and accumulated a bill of ₹48,000 within 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. CCTV footage shows Vedant and his friends drinking alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Around 12 AM, Cosie stopped serving them alcohol, so they left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. They then proceeded to another club, Blak, at Marriott Suites, also about 3 km away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. At approximately 2 AM, Vedant and two friends departed Blak in his electric Porsche Taycan while intoxicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. His driver was also present in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Around 2:30 AM, Aneesh and Ashwini were returning home on a motorcycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. As their motorcycle made a U-turn on Kalyani Nagar Airport Road, Vedant's Porsche, reportedly speeding between 160 kmph and over 200 kmph, collided with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The collision caused the car's airbags to deploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, and in moments, Aneesh and Ashwini passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Onlookers at the scene apprehended Vedant and handed him over to the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Initial Police Involvement & Controversies

Vedant Agarwal was taken to Yerwada police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. An hour after the incident, at 3 AM, MLA Sunil Tingre arrived at the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Tingre stated in an interview that he went because he had known Vedant's family for 30 years and considered them friends, having been called there by Vedant's father, Vishal Agarwal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

An "interesting incident" also occurred at the police station that night: a man arrived in a Mercedes, accompanied by other cars, carrying 6-7 pizza cartons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Reporters outside reported a "feast" with pizza being served <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Sunil Tingre left the station at 6 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

An FIR was filed against Vedant at 8:26 AM on May 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
The FIR was registered under Section 304A (D€ath by Negligence), which carries a maximum punishment of 2 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This was controversial, as many argued it should have been filed under Section 304 (Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder), which applies when one knows their actions could lead to death but still commits them, and carries a maximum punishment of 10 years imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The key difference lies in the knowledge of the potential fatal outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Critics questioned if MLA Sunil Tingre influenced this decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

It was also revealed that the Porsche Taycan's permanent registration had been pending since March because Mr. Agarwal had not paid the ₹1,758 fees, meaning the car did not have a number plate at the time of the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Vedant's grandfather stated the car was a gift for Vedant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Investigation Frauds and Cover-ups

Police required Vedant's blood test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The test was conducted at 11 AM, approximately 8 hours after the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Despite the delay, which would normally allow alcohol to dissipate, the test results were negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This was due to a fraudulent act: the doctor who conducted the test at the hospital allegedly threw away the real blood sample and replaced it with another, clean sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The Agarwal family reportedly paid ₹300,000 to two doctors, Dr. Ajay Taware and Dr. Shrihari Halnor, to change the blood samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Both doctors have since been arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Further attempts at cover-up included Vedant's mother requesting their driver to take the blame for the crash, and his grandfather threatening the driver to admit he was driving that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. However, the presence of many witnesses prevented this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Juvenile Justice Board Decision & Public Outrage

The most shocking part of the case initially was the Juvenile Justice Board granting Vedant bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. As part of the bail conditions, Vedant was instructed to study traffic rules, prepare a presentation, and write a 300-word essay on road accidents and their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This lenient outcome, given that his drunk driving killed two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, caused national uproar and widespread outrage on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

> "A rich family's son, drives a Porsche under the influence of alcohol, and ends up k!lling 2 people, so he is told to write an essay." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

> "Look at the ease at which the accused get away because of their political or social connections. Do you feel it's all a lost cause?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>

> "Has justice been reduced to a joke? For the rich, is the cost of our lives worth less than that of a cockroach?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>

## Subsequent Legal Actions & Further Developments

Public outrage pressured the police, leading them to move the Sessions Court on May 20, seeking to try Vedant as an adult and to modify Section 304A to Section 304 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The Sessions Court directed the police to approach the Juvenile Justice Board for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Police also booked more individuals in the case, including the owner and manager of Club Cosie, his father, and the managers of Blak restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. When three of them were brought to court for a remand application, Judge S.P. Ponkshe made a controversial statement, asking, "what will the people on the streets do? Because those coming to big pubs will not go home walking. They will drive their vehicles," suggesting that alcohol servers should limit how much they serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This statement was criticized for potentially shifting blame from the driver to the pub owners, whose primary fault was serving alcohol to an underage individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Due to continued pressure, police lodged an FIR against Vedant's father, Vishal Agarwal, under Section 75 (willful neglect or exposure to illness of a child) and Section 77 (supplying intoxicating liquor or drugs to a child) of the Juvenile Justice Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Additionally, Sections 3, 5, and 199A of the Motor Vehicles Act were cited for allowing Vedant to drive without a license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

On May 20, Vishal Agarwal was reported to be on the run after securing bail for his son, having bought a new SIM card to evade tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. However, he was arrested the next day, May 21, in Aurangabad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

On May 22, Vedant was produced in the Juvenile Court, and Section 185 (driving under the influence of alcohol) was invoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Police requested the court to try Vedant as an adult, and he was remanded to the Nehru Udyog Kendra Observation Home in Yerwada until June 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Legal Technicalities and Precedents

A legal technicality makes it challenging to impose strict punishment on Vedant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Under the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act, 2015, an amendment brought after the Nirbhaya case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, individuals aged 16-18 who commit "heinous crimes" can be tried as adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. A "heinous crime" is defined as one with a minimum imprisonment of at least 7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

However, even though Section 304 of the IPC (Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder) has a maximum sentence of 10 years, it does not specify a *minimum* sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This means that, technically, the crime does not fall under the "heinous crime" category for the purpose of trying a minor as an adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Coincidentally, Vedant was only four months shy of his 18th birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

The concept of *Doli Incapax* (age of criminal responsibility) posits that children below a certain age cannot intentionally commit crimes and should be reformed rather than punished like adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. While the specific age varies by country (e.g., 6, 9, 12, or 15 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, the philosophy aims to provide opportunities for reform, especially for children from disadvantaged backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. However, critics argue this should not apply to individuals like Vedant, who come from privileged backgrounds and have access to education and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

This legal loophole has allowed criminals like Vedant to evade justice in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **2016 Delhi Case:** Four days before his 18th birthday, a three-time repeat juvenile offender ran over a 32-year-old man in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The family's driver initially took the blame but later withdrew his statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The Juvenile Justice Board ruled he should be tried as an adult due to his age and repeat offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. However, in 2020, the Supreme Court denied this, stating that Section 304 is "technically not a heinous crime," and he should be tried as a minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Kanpur Case:** Days before the Pune incident, a similar case emerged in Kanpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. A 15-year-old boy killed two people in October 2023 in a motor accident under Section 304, receiving easy bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. In March 2024, he committed another hit-and-run, killing four more people, but again got off "scot-free" with Sections 279 and 338 imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. He was finally arrested on May 22, amidst the widespread social media outrage over the Pune incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Broader Systemic Issues

The incident has highlighted perceived systemic corruption, where wealth appears to enable preferential treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

> "Everything is legal for rich people. If you have money, you can do anything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>

> "You can drive a car without a licence plate. You can drink alcohol despite being underage. You can drink and drive your car at 200 kmph. On committing a crime, MLAs will be at your service to help you. With enough bribes, doctors will change your blood samples. The courts will ask you to write an essay as punishment for your crime and everything will be forgiven." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>

In contrast, common citizens who follow rules and pay taxes may face arbitrary actions from authorities, such as demolitions despite court orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, police brutality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, or even death from illegal infrastructure or adulterated goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

The incident underscores the need for greater accountability, particularly for parents who allow underage or unlicensed driving and whose "bad parenting" contributes to such crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The collective voice of the people and social media outrage in this case has forced authorities to take stricter actions, leading to the arrest of the doctors involved in changing blood samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. This emphasizes the power of public unity in fighting a corrupt system, as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar advocated: "Educate, Agitate, Organise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

On December 24, 1999, Indian Airlines flight IC 814, bound for Delhi from Kathmandu, was hijacked by five individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This incident became the largest and last plane hijacking in Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The hijackers initially demanded $200 million and the release of certain terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The week-long crisis unfolded on television screens across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## [[ic_814_hijacking_incident_timeline | Incident Timeline and Initial Responses]]

The hijacking occurred shortly after the flight took off from Kathmandu, with four masked men announcing the takeover during lunch service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Captain Devi Sharan was forced at gunpoint to fly westwards, with the hijackers intending to reach Pakistan, specifically Lahore Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Indian air traffic controllers (ATC) learned of the hijacking at 4:40 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, while Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Principal Secretary, Brajesh Mishra, were informed an hour later at 5:20 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Attempts to Land in Lahore

Pakistani air traffic controllers in Lahore initially "strictly forbade" the flight from landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Captain Sharan communicated that the plane was running low on fuel and requested India to ask Pakistan for landing permission, as the hijackers were threatening to kill passengers if not allowed to land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The Indian High Commission in Pakistan formally requested permission at 6:30 PM, but it was denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Captain Sharan eventually convinced the hijackers to land in Amritsar for refueling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The flight began its descent at 6:44 PM and landed at Amritsar Airport at 7:01 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:31]</a>. This landing presented a "golden opportunity" for Indian authorities to regain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

However, a series of "historic blunders" and "several mistakes" occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>:
*   Punjab's Director General of Police, Sarabjit Singh, learned about the hijacking through TV news an hour before the landing, highlighting a "communication failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   A crisis management group was formed to delay the plane for commando strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, but hijackers refused to communicate with local police, insisting on Delhi officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Despite repeated requests from Captain Sharan for refueling, which the hijackers threatened to escalate if denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, refueling was not initiated for 40 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:41]</a>. During this delay, passenger Satnam Singh was attacked and injured with a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   A plan to puncture the plane's tires by hiding officers near a fuel tanker was formulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:54]</a>. However, another plan to block the plane with a fuel tanker was executed poorly; the tanker moved too fast, then stopped abruptly due to miscommunication, alerting the hijackers to a planned intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   Frustrated, the hijackers forced Captain Sharan to take off without refueling, narrowly avoiding the tanker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:07:12]</a>. The plane became airborne at 7:49 PM, precisely when NSG commandos arrived at the airport, too late to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:29]</a>.

A controversial theory suggests that the plane was allowed to take off from Amritsar to ensure the safety of Shashi Bhushan Singh Tomar, the brother-in-law of Prime Minister Vajpayee's Secretary N.K. Singh, who was among the passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:30]</a>. Critics also noted that top leaders, including then-Home Minister LK Advani, learned about the hijacking from TV news rather than official channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:56]</a>.

## Pakistan's Complicity and Actions

After taking off from Amritsar, the plane again headed towards Lahore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:50]</a>. Pakistan's ATC again denied permission to land, even turning off all airport lights and navigational aids to prevent a forced landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:08:12]</a>. However, facing an imminent highway crash, Captain Sharan made a final request, and Lahore ATC finally agreed to allow the plane to land at 8:07 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:49]</a>.

India requested Pakistan to prevent the plane from taking off again and planned to send the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad, G Parthasarathy, to negotiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:09:03]</a>. The plane was refueled, and lights were turned off again, with Pakistani commandos surrounding the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:18]</a>. Pakistan reportedly attempted to negotiate the release of women and children, but these negotiations failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:30]</a>. Another passenger, Rupin Katyal, returning from his honeymoon, was brutally stabbed to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:54]</a>.

Despite the measures, the plane took off from Lahore again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:10]</a>. The Indian High Commissioner was provided a helicopter 3 hours late, arriving only after the plane had departed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:10:07]</a>. The transcript notes that "We do not have much information about this" regarding how the plane took off despite the lights being off and commandos surrounding it, but suggests "some clues later on in the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:20]</a>.

### Hijackers' Identities and Pakistani Links

The hijackers used code names: Chief (leader), Burger, Doctor, Shankar, and Bhola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:36]</a>. Most of them were identified as being from Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:52]</a>.

When the plane landed in Kandahar, Afghanistan, after leaving Dubai, the Indian government suspected the Taliban's intentions due to their members surrounding the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:23]</a>. Indian analysts believed this was to prevent Indian military operations against the hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:40]</a>. Ajit Doval, part of the negotiation team in Kandahar, claimed the hijackers received support from active ISI (Pakistan's intelligence agency) presence in Kandahar, guaranteeing them a safe exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:56]</a>. He further stated that without ISI involvement, the hijacking would not have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:14:03]</a>.

The hijackers demanded $200 million (â‚¹16.5 billion) and the release of 36 prisoners, plus the dead body of Sajjad Afghani, founder of Harkat-Ul-Mujahideen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:55]</a>. Harkat was a Pakistan-based militant group active in PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir), and 33 of the 36 demanded prisoners were Pakistanis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

When the demands were met and three prisoners were released in Kandahar on December 31, 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:17]</a>, the Indian team expected the hijackers to be arrested by the Taliban. However, the Taliban's supreme leader and another member drove the hijackers and the released terrorists towards the Pakistani border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:38]</a>. This action made Pakistan's involvement "clear to India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:42]</a>. An official statement noted that "2 of the released persons have surfaced there. Only goes to confirm that [[pakistans_support_of_terrorism | Pakistan is neck deep in this dirty game of hijacking]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:52]</a>. The hijackers "safely crossed the border to reach Pakistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:08]</a>.

## Aftermath and [[impact_of_ic_814_hijacking_on_indian_aviation_security | Security Changes]]

The passengers were finally released and returned home on December 31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:20]</a>. The hijacked plane, being 20 years old, was retired in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:27]</a>.

Blame for the incident largely fell on the hijackers and their supporters, including the Taliban and "Pakistani forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:35]</a>. The incumbent Indian government also faced criticism for its "terrible" handling of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:45]</a>. The "big blunders" and "communication gap" at Amritsar were highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:57]</a>. It is believed that the mishandling by Indian authorities contributed to the later formation of the Jaish-e-Mohammad group and subsequent attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:20:02]</a>.

A positive outcome of this incident is that no other plane hijacking has occurred in India since, as regulations and processes have been made "extremely difficult" to hijack any plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:12]</a>. The security breach at Kathmandu's airport, which is said to have used Dawood Ibrahim's Nepal network, remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:29]</a>.

The **Taj Mahal**, often hailed as the "7th Wonder of the World" and a symbol of love, has been the subject of numerous claims, particularly concerning 22 closed doors within its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Some theories suggest these doors conceal idols of Hindu Gods, while others whimsically claim they hide "fabled good days" like cheap petrol, diesel, and employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. More significantly, a persistent theory posits that the **Taj Mahal** is not a Mughal construction but rather a Shiv Temple known as Tejo Mahalaya, originally built in the 13th century by Raja Paramardi Dev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Recent Controversy and Legal Challenge

A recent iteration of these [[Controversies about Taj Mahal being a Hindu Temple | controversies about the Taj Mahal]] emerged when BJP politician Rajneesh Singh filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The petition demanded the opening of the 22 closed rooms to investigate claims of hidden Hindu idols, asserting the **Taj Mahal** was originally a Hindu temple, Tejo Mahalaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The petitioner sought a directive to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to form a special committee for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Court Dismissal

The Allahabad High Court dismissed the petition, stating that such filings mocked the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The court questioned the legal or constitutional grounds for the petition, emphasizing that historical research is the domain of historians who must follow proper methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## ASI's Explanation

Despite the court's dismissal, the debate continued in media and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. To put an end to the speculation, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) publicly released photographs of the closed rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

According to ASI sources, these 22 "rooms" are not individual chambers but a long corridor with doors on its sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. These doors have not always been locked; ASI staff routinely clean the corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. A retired ASI official clarified that there is nothing on the walls, and having such underground rooms is typical for Mughal monuments like the Humayun's Tomb and Safdarjung Tomb in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. These areas serve as structural elements supporting the monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Another retired ASI official explained that the area was cordoned off because there was nothing for tourists to see, and keeping them open unnecessarily would lead to overcrowding and potential wear and tear on the monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The **Taj Mahal** is a protected World Heritage Site attracting over 100,000 visitors daily, necessitating measures to preserve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The released photos showcased the ongoing restoration work within these areas and the dedication of ASI staff in preserving monuments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Historical Claims and Refutations

The claim that the **Taj Mahal** was a Hindu temple is not new. In April 2015, a similar suit was filed in Agra court by six lawyers claiming the **Taj Mahal** was a Shiv Temple and seeking permission for Hindu worship there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. They asserted that Raja Paramardi Dev built Tejo Mahalaya in 1212 AD, which was later inherited by Raja Maan Singh and then Raja Jai Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. They alleged that Shah Jahan annexed the property in 1632 and converted the temple into a memorial for Mumtaz Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

The government, through the Union Ministry of Culture, denied these claims in November 2015, stating there was no evidence that the **Taj Mahal** was a Hindu Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The ASI reiterated this stance in 2017, confirming the **Taj Mahal** is a tomb, not a temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### The Role of Raja Jai Singh

The claim about Shah Jahan annexing Raja Jai Singh's land for the **Taj Mahal** has also been addressed. Historians explain that Raja Jai Singh, who lived in the area where the **Taj Mahal** stands, had friendly relations with Shah Jahan due to long-standing ties between their royal families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Raja Jai Singh actually intended to donate his land for free for the empress's tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, Shah Jahan did not accept the donation and instead exchanged it for four other palaces, a transaction recorded in official papers dated December 28, 1633, and verifiable in Jaipur's City Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### [[Influence of PN Oak on Taj Mahal conspiracy theories | P.N. Oak's Influence]]

The propagation of the Tejo Mahalaya theory largely stems from Purushottam Nagesh Oak (P.N. Oak), a self-proclaimed "history enthusiast" who, despite not being a trained historian, "rewrote history" with his own versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Oak's methodology involved drawing superficial similarities between words to assert historical connections, such as claiming the Vatican was once a Hindu temple because "Vatican" sounds like "Vatika" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. He even claimed Westminster Abbey was a Hindu temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

Oak initially stated the **Taj Mahal** was an ancient Hindu wonder, but after historians refuted this, he revised his claim, stating it was built in 1155 by Raja Paramardi Dev's chief minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. In 1989, he published "Taj Mahal: The True Story" and filed a PIL in 2000 based on his pamphlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The Supreme Court dismissed his petition as "misconceived" and even "ridiculed" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

With the rise of WhatsApp and social media, Oak's fictional narratives have been widely circulated, leading to repeated petitions in courts and public debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. For instance, Oak's 1155 AD claim morphed into 1212 AD in a recent petition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## [[Myths about Shah Jahan and Taj Mahal workers | Other Myths]]

Another widely circulated [[Myths about Shah Jahan and Taj Mahal workers | myth about the Taj Mahal]] is that Shah Jahan ordered the hands of 20,000 labourers to be chopped off after its construction to prevent them from building another equally beautiful monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This claim has even been repeated by public figures like Union Agricultural Minister Narendra Singh Tomar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

Logically, such an act involving 20,000 workers is improbable and lacks any historical or archaeological evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. No skeletal remains or historical accounts from court historians or foreign travellers of the era mention this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

In contrast, historical evidence suggests Shah Jahan fostered a thriving architectural environment. He built a large settlement called Taj Ganj for thousands of masons, artisans, and workers, whose descendants still live and work there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. After the **Taj Mahal**, Shah Jahan's workers built an entirely new city, Shahjahanabad (later Delhi), which includes monuments like the Red Fort and Jama Masjid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This era is known as the Golden Period of Mughal Architecture, made possible by Shah Jahan's respect for his workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[History of the Taj Mahal | history of the Taj Mahal]] is well-documented through Mughal autobiographies, court historians' records, and contemporary accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The mystery surrounding the 22 closed doors has been resolved by the ASI, which has provided clear explanations and photographic evidence. Despite recurrent baseless rumors, the **Taj Mahal** remains an architectural marvel, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of India's most popular tourist attractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

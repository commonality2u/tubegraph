Scientists indicate that the [[extinction_of_dinosaurs_due_to_asteroid_impact | asteroid strike]] which caused the extinction of dinosaurs was the fifth major extinction event in Earth's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Following this, the sixth extinction event is believed to have already begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. This ongoing event, named the Holocene Extinction Event, is attributed to human activities rather than natural phenomena like volcanic eruptions or asteroid impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

## Unprecedented Biodiversity Loss

Over the last 100-200 years, there has been an unprecedented scale of biodiversity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Animal and plant species are rapidly going extinct due to human actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Biologists generally agree that this constitutes a mass extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. The current rate of extinction is estimated to be more than 100 to 1,000 times higher than the normal background extinction rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## Causes

The primary drivers of this human-induced extinction event include:
*   Deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>
*   Pollution in oceans and the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>

These activities lead to the destruction of animal habitats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Thousands of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians are now categorized as endangered or have already become extinct because of human impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

## International Efforts to Mitigate

To address this destruction, international efforts have been initiated:
*   **2010 UN Convention on Biological Diversity Meeting**: Held in Japan, this meeting set 20 biodiversity targets to be achieved by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. Unfortunately, only six of these targets were partially met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.
*   **2020 Paris-style Plan**: In January 2020, a new plan, similar to the Paris Agreement, was established to prevent biodiversity and ecosystem collapse, with a deadline set for 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Key objectives of this plan include:
    *   Designating 30% of global land and oceans as protected areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
    *   Reducing pollution by at least 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.
    *   Limiting annual extinctions to 20 species or fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

The success of these targets is crucial, as unchecked extinctions could potentially threaten human survival itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

## Human Timeline in Perspective

Humans originated merely 300,000 years ago in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. In contrast, dinosaurs were the dominant species on Earth for 174 million years, a period 600 times longer than human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The ability of humans to surpass this record will depend on collective efforts to protect the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

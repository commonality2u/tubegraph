People often associate money with happiness and fulfillment, but a deeper look into the lives of the wealthy and the reflections of those nearing the end of their lives reveals a different truth about what truly matters.

## The Illusion of Wealth
While money can provide many things, it cannot buy fundamental aspects of human well-being. For instance, money can buy a home, but not a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, or a bed, but not sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It can buy a watch, but not time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, and food, but not the desire to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The pursuit of wealth often leads to [[the_downsides_of_wealth_and_fame | misery]] for many rich people and celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Billionaires and Unhappiness
Despite immense wealth, many billionaires experience significant personal struggles:
*   **Elon Musk**
    *   His 20-year-old daughter filed a petition to disavow any relationship with him upon turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. His biographer revealed he was hurt by this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   Musk has publicly stated that his reality involves "great highs, terrible lows, and unrelenting stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   Reports indicate he takes microdoses of ketamine for depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   He has also had multiple failed marriages and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   When asked how to become like him, Musk advised against it, stating he's not sure he wants to be himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **High Divorce Rates**
    *   A Forbes study found that 49% of billionaires' marriages end in divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This includes prominent figures like Bernard Arnault, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates, and Sergei Brin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This highlights that money cannot buy a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Family Disputes**
    *   Even with millions, rich families often fight over money, as seen in the Ambani brothers' lengthy court cases and public disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Celebrity Mental Health Struggles
Many famous and wealthy individuals have faced severe mental health challenges:
*   **Suicides:**
    *   Pratyusha Banerjee, lead in the TV serial Balika Vadhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   Hollywood actor Robin Williams, a renowned stand-up comedian whose jolly face hid his sorrows and depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
    *   Kurt Cobain, lead singer of Nirvana, who committed suicide at 27 at the peak of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Depression:**
    *   Kapil Sharma revealed he was depressed and had suicidal tendencies, learning to enjoy small things in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
    *   Deepika Padukone, a successful Indian actress, openly discussed her struggle with depression and promotes mental health awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Money did not provide happiness for these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## The Fisherman and the Businessman: A Parable of Contentment
A famous story illustrates different life priorities:
A businessman encounters a fisherman leisurely enjoying the beach after catching only a few fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The businessman advises him to work harder, buy more nets, a bigger boat, hire employees, and accumulate wealth to eventually relax on the beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The fisherman points out that he is already doing exactly thatâ€”relaxing on the beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

This parable highlights that true contentment is not necessarily found in the accumulation of wealth but in appreciating what one already has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Many people who don't earn a lot are still happy and satisfied, while many rich millionaires are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Beyond Material Possessions: The True Worth of Money
Money cannot buy self-image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. People on their deathbeds do not regret not earning more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Social Responsibility and Consumerism
Some film actors, despite earning billions, engage in surrogate ads for tobacco products out of greed, sacrificing their [[social_responsibility_and_consumerism | social responsibility and conscience]] for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This demonstrates that endless accumulation does not lead to satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Critiquing "Hustle Culture" and Consumerism
Many motivational gurus promote the idea that becoming a millionaire is the sole purpose in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This contrasts with the idea that money is merely a by-product of one's work and efforts, not the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Social media further fuels this race for money by showcasing luxury items, making people feel the need to acquire more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### Money as a Base
Money is essential up to a certain level to achieve a decent living standard, covering necessities like housing, medical insurance, education, and basic food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This base level of money is necessary for attaining [[money_and_happiness | happiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. However, the exact amount needed to maximize satisfaction varies for everyone and is not as high as often perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

## The Top 5 Regrets of the Dying
Bronnie Ware, an Australian nurse working in palliative care, documented the most common regrets of terminally ill patients in her book "The Top 5 Regrets of the Dying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>:

1.  **"I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a> People regretted not living on their own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
2.  **"I wish I hadn't worked so hard."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a> They regretted being overly focused on work and money, wishing they had spent more time with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
3.  **"I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a> They regretted not having the courage to express their true feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.
4.  **"I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a> They regretted losing friends along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
5.  **"I wish I had let myself be happier."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a> They regretted not allowing themselves to be happier with what they had and not pursuing their happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Crucially, **not a single person on their deathbeds regretted not earning more money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This highlights the real worth of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Embracing a Balanced Life
Instead of prioritizing endless work and consumption, it is important to enjoy life as it happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Philosophies like non-possessiveness in Hinduism and Jainism, or Gautam Buddha's "Middle Way" (living without total immersion in things), emphasize that freedom lies in minimalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. The more one owns, the more maintenance and responsibility one acquires, potentially becoming a slave to their lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

Real happiness is found in doing what one truly enjoys, having a sense of purpose, helping others, and sharing (Daan in Hinduism, Zakat in Islam, Dasvandh in Sikhism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Prioritizing happiness and satisfaction over money is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

The conduct of influencers and content creators on digital platforms has become a significant concern regarding [[social_responsibility_and_consumerism | social responsibility and consumerism]]. The discourse often highlights the need for content creators to consider the impact of their actions and promoted content on their audience, especially the youth.

## The Problem of Irresponsible Influence

Certain content creators, like Elvish Yadav, are criticized for exhibiting uncivilized behavior such as using vile language, engaging in violence, spreading hatred, abusing intoxicants, promoting addiction to betting, and objectifying girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. These actions are seen as a "threat to our society and our country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The speaker argues that such individuals should be exposed so the public understands they are "following idiots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

A major concern within [[challenges_with_influencer_ethics_and_promotion_standards | challenges with influencer ethics and promotion standards]] is the "bad publicity is good publicity" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, which can lead influencers to disregard ethical standards for increased visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This often results in [[paid_social_media_trends_and_fake_pr | paid social media trends and fake PR]], where influencers promote harmful products for financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Examples of Irresponsible Conduct

*   **Promoting Gambling/Betting Apps**: Influencers are criticized for promoting apps that waste youth's time and money and disturb their mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Some influencers readily promote "any harmful substance if they are paid enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Misleading Information**: Spreading baseless lies, such as claiming a public figure shared pornographic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, or making factual errors about organizations and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, demonstrates a lack of accountability.
*   **Hate Speech and Division**: Influencers contribute to societal division by spreading hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, using religious themes to promote division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>, and displaying cover pictures on social media that reflect "thirst for the blood of Muslims all over the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a> by celebrating characters with genocidal intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. This behavior attacks the unity of the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.
*   **Objectification of Women**: Some influencers promote apps for "objectifying girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, make inappropriate comments about women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>, and glamorize the objectification of women in their songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.
*   **Disrespecting Religious Sentiments**: Mocking Hindu mantras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>, making fun of Hanuman Chalisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>, and using religious imagery for "cheap theatrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a> or to sell merchandise with distorted scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a> are highlighted as unacceptable.
*   **Glorifying Violence and Intoxicants**: Creating content that glamorizes weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a> or portrays consumption of intoxicants positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a> is seen as leading youth "towards a wrong direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

## Personal Standards for Responsible Influence

The speaker emphasizes that as a "biological human being," they do not possess divine knowledge to foresee the future of companies they promote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. However, upon realizing an issue, they immediately remove problematic ads and set new, stricter standards for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This aligns with [[personal_philosophies_and_influence_of_media | personal philosophies and influence of media]].

The speaker's explicit standards for promotion include:
*   **No betting, gambling, or fantasy apps** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, to prevent youth addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **No tobacco products or cigarettes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **No Chinese companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **No fast food or soft drink companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, due to their harmful health impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The speaker expresses a desire for more influencers and actors to adopt similar ethical standards to have a "positive impact on society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This reflects the broader theme of [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | influence of media on social behavior and norms]].

## Call to Action for Influencers

The speaker outlines ten specific tasks for influencers to adopt more responsible behavior, aiming to foster positive change and set the right example for their followers:

1.  **Stop Spreading Hatred**: Remove hateful profile pictures and promote "Indian Unity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
2.  **Cease Promoting Betting Apps**: These apps ruin youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The speaker offers to find alternative sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
3.  **Edit Out Offensive Content**: Remove portions of videos that are anti-Hindu, use Lord Ram's name cheaply, or mock Hanuman Chalisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.
4.  **Redesign Merchandise**: Stop selling merchandise with distorted Hindu scriptures; instead, use actual quotes from scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.
5.  **Delete Problematic Videos**: Remove videos that normalize or encourage harmful activities, like consuming intoxicants (e.g., "Holi Pe Bhang Peeke Set Hogye") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.
6.  **Eradicate Misogynistic Content**: Delete videos that disrespect women or attack their dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. This is not freedom of expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
7.  **Improve General Knowledge**: Learn basic concepts (e.g., how gold rates are decided) to avoid spreading misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
8.  **Promote Respectful Language**: Encourage followers to stop using vile language and insulting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
9.  **Create Positive Content**: Choose themes for songs that contribute positively to Indian culture instead of glamorizing violence or objectifying women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
10. **Avoid Illegal Activities**: Stop engaging in violence, threats, or activities that could lead to legal trouble, such as criminal defamation or disturbing communal harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

While the speaker acknowledges that not all influencers engage in [[activism_and_raising_political_awareness_through_social_media | activism and raising political awareness through social media]] or challenge the [[impact_of_political_influence on media | impact of political influence on media]], they emphasize the moral imperative to avoid actions that harm society.

After the collapse of Somalia's central government in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>, its coast guard ceased to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This absence of maritime law enforcement turned Somalia's waters into a free-for-all zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>, leading to widespread illegal activities by foreign entities.

## Illegal Fishing

The sea near Somalia is rich in marine life and biodiverse, featuring numerous coral reefs and high concentrations of fish, particularly tuna, sardines, shrimps, and rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. With the country's instability, many foreign fishing vessels exploited the situation by illegally fishing for tuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

According to a 2006 United Nations report, seafood worth around $300 million was being stolen annually from the Somali coastline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. These foreign vessels often used steel-made drag fishing nets, which are destructive as they are dragged on the seafloor, dislodging coral reefs and endangering the future livelihoods of local fishermen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. When local fishermen complained, foreign fishermen would retaliate with bullets and water cannons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

## Toxic Waste Dumping

Alongside illegal fishing, foreign companies began dumping toxic industrial waste on the Somali coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. Since the 1980s, European companies had been dumping toxic elements such as uranium, lead, cadmium, and mercury in northern Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. This trend significantly increased after the government fell in 1991, with waste being dumped directly into the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

Swiss and Italian companies were primarily blamed for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>, including the Swiss company Achair & Partners and the Italian company Progresso Sri, both registered as waste management companies but involved in waste trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. Waste from German, French, and Italian nuclear power plants and hospitals also contributed to the dumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

The cost difference was a significant motivator: proper waste disposal in Europe cost $250 per tonne, whereas illegally dumping it in the Somali sea cost only $2.5 per tonne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

### "Guns for Waste"

To facilitate dumping, foreign companies often contracted with local warlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. Local Somali goons from different clans were given weapons in exchange for permission to dump waste, a practice known as "Guns for Waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. This system brought more weapons into Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. These companies also benefited doubly by using the same ships to dump toxic waste and then illegally transport fished tuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

The Italian mafia was also involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. Italian TV journalist Ilaria Alpi and her cameraman Miran Hrovatin were murdered in 1994 while investigating the "Guns for Waste" trade, having collected evidence of these activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. Francesco Fonti of the Italian Mafia later admitted to sending toxic waste to Somalia, with major politicians and even Italy's peacekeeping troops being told to turn a blind eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. Other countries like Russia, Germany, and the USA were also implicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.

## Environmental and Health Impacts

In December 2004, a terrible tsunami hit the Indian Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. The tsunami caused toxic waste containers in Somali waters to break, releasing waste onto the Somali coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

> "The tsunami took the lives of some 150 people in Somalia, and poisoned the precious little water supply that people had here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>

This incident led to widespread illness in many villages, including acute respiratory infections, cough, bleeding gums and mouth, brain hemorrhages, unusual skin rashes, and even deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. A local doctor noted an unprecedented number of cancer cases in that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. The combination of civil war, poverty, starvation, depleted fish stocks, and toxic waste created a dire situation for common Somali citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

## Emergence of Somali Pirates

Fed up with the encroachment on their country's resources and waters, Somali fishermen began patrolling together, attacking foreign illegal fishing vessels and calling themselves "Coast Guards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>. Initially, these attacks aimed to protect their rights, but as they realized the potential for profit, piracy began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

These fishermen allied with armed local goons to form groups like the Somali Coastguards and National Volunteer Coastguards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. They hijacked foreign fishing vessels, brought them to the coast, and demanded ransom for the crew's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. The success of this led to poor and troubled youth adopting piracy as their main occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>, contributing to the narrative of [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates Robin Hood or villains]].

The food and job shortages in Somalia were so severe that piracy became the only means for young boys to support their households and feed themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>. In the local Somali language, pirates refer to themselves as "Badaadinta Badah" (The Saviours of the Sea) or the "coast guard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>. They justify their actions, stating that hijacking and demanding ransom is a legitimate tax due to the absence of a central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Current State

A survey by a Somali news website found that about 70% of Somali people support piracy as a form of national defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>. A pirate interviewed by the Pulitzer Center stated that those who illegally enter Somali waters, steal fish, and dump toxic waste should be labeled "pirates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>. No effort has been made to clean up the toxic and nuclear waste dumped in Somalia's waters, nor has the country received any compensation for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:00">[29:49:00]</a>.

International organizations identify poverty and unemployment as the root causes of this piracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>, noting a correlation between illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing areas and the prevalence of pirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>.

A similar situation is observed in Nigeria, where the Gulf of Guinea has become a new piracy hotspot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a>. Nigerian pirates loot oil tankers, driven by the local population's resentment towards multinational companies that profit from their oil while simultaneously destroying their environment and causing diseases like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>. This has led locals to destroy oil pipelines, kidnap oil workers, and loot tankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>.

Despite the grievances, the narrative concludes that injustice from one side cannot justify injustice from the other, and that most pirates are local gangsters rather than helpless individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:53:00">[30:53:00]</a>. The article implies that while revolting against injustice is humane, such revolution becomes useless if it takes the form of more injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>.

Political parties in Maharashtra have resorted to offering monetary "freebies" to various segments of the population, including women, unemployed youth, students, and farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. While the Maha Yuti Alliance promises ₹2,100 to women and senior citizens, ₹10,000 to students, and ₹1,250 to farmers, the Mahavikas Agadi Alliance offers ₹3,000 to women and ₹4,000 to unemployed youth monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This approach is seen as a way to garner votes and maintain a form of "slavery," rather than genuinely empowering the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

The funds for these freebies are derived from taxes, largely borne by the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This strategy contributes to a shrinking middle class and a decline in consumer demand, impacting sectors like automobiles, housing, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The unemployment rate among educated individuals in Maharashtra reached 15% by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, with many struggling with low salaries and high tax burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Failures in Public Services

Despite the tax contributions, the middle class receives inadequate public services, leading to significant challenges in daily life:
*   **Education** Public government schools lack quality, forcing parents to send children to increasingly expensive private schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. For instance, a school in Dadar, Mumbai, demanded ₹86,000 for first-grade admission, and another in Borivali charged ₹135,000 for third grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Public Transport** Mumbai's local trains suffer severe overcrowding, leading to over 51,800 deaths in 20 years from people falling off trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure** Roads are plagued by potholes due to poor drainage, despite promises from the Chief Minister to make Mumbai roads pothole-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Healthcare** Government hospitals are in "unacceptable" conditions, as noted by the Bombay High Court, with incidents like 31 deaths in 72 hours at Dr. Shankar Ravchand Government Medical College and Hospital and 18 deaths in 24 hours at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This forces the middle class into exploitative private healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Environment** Maharashtra ranks second in India for deaths due to air pollution, with 149,118 lives lost in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. A 2022 World Bank paper revealed that 97.6% of Maharashtra's population breathes air beyond safe levels, exacerbated by inadequate waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Economic and Social Disparities
Maharashtra, despite being the richest state by projected GDP, ranks 12th in Net State Domestic Product Per Capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Rural poverty in Maharashtra is higher than the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The state leads in farmer suicides, accounting for 38% of the national total in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

Geographical inequality is evident, with Western Maharashtra (Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Raigad, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur) being affluent, while Eastern Maharashtra (Vidarbha region) faces dryness and poverty, leading to demands for statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Even within cities, stark contrasts exist, such as Mumbai housing the highest number of billionaires in Asia (92) alongside Asia's largest slum, Dharavi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Mission Swaraj: Sustainable Solutions for Development

Instead of distributing money, the focus should shift to sustainable solutions that empower citizens and foster true growth. The following proposals are inspired by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's vision of Swaraj, which emphasizes local empowerment and non-discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>:

1.  **Agriculture and Rural Development**:
    *   Implement successful farming models by appointing 9,000 agricultural assistants (5 villages per assistant) to teach advanced techniques like soil testing, natural farming, drip irrigation, crop rotation, mulching, and multi-layer farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
    *   Replicate the Hiware Bazar model of rainwater harvesting and water conservation to transform drought-prone villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
    *   Establish local markets and farmer cooperatives for direct consumer connections and promote food processing to increase farmer income to ₹1.5 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. This represents a significant shift from debt waivers to long-term economic stability.

2.  **[[Employment and Skill Development Initiatives|Alternative employment opportunities and skill development]]**:
    *   Promote small and medium businesses and cottage industries, which are labor-intensive, to address unemployment and reduce pollution from mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
    *   Support artisans and craftsmen in setting up their shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

3.  **[[Educational infrastructure and opportunities|Education and womens empowerment as solutions]]**:
    *   Provide free, quality education by reforming teacher appointments, hiring administrative assistants for non-teaching tasks, doubling permanent teachers, and revitalizing education department officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

4.  **Healthcare**:
    *   Ensure free, quality healthcare for all citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

5.  **Law and Order**:
    *   Increase the police force to 585,000 personnel (2.5 times the current number) for effective crime eradication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
    *   Establish a separate investigation team and ensure equal justice for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

6.  **Infrastructure and Cleanliness**:
    *   Revamp roads, buses, and trains to ensure safety and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
    *   Prioritize cleanliness and waste management, drawing inspiration from initiatives like Afroz Shah's beach clean-up efforts in Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a> and Rwanda's successful monthly community clean-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. This includes implementing proper drainage, footpaths, and sidewalks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

These solutions, while requiring significant political will to abandon "crony capitalism" and "kickback models," promise increased farmer income, exponential growth in the informal sector, economic expansion, increased tax revenue, and resolved unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. It is crucial for voters to demand these changes, holding political parties accountable for genuine development rather than short-term monetary handouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

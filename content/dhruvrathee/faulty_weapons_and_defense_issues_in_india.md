The film *Jawan* highlights the issue of faulty weapons in India, depicting how soldiers are martyred not by enemy bullets, but due to their own country's defective weaponry, which is manufactured by "crony capitalists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. These depictions are reportedly inspired by real-life incidents and numerous reports over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

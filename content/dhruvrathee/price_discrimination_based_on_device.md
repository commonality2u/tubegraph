Companies have been increasingly employing various tactics to manipulate customer pricing, including [[misleading_marketing_tactics | price discrimination]] based on the device or even battery level used by the consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This systemic issue results in different prices for the same product or service depending on the customer's device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Device-Based Price Differences

Reports indicate that prices for goods and services can vary significantly between different operating systems.

### iPhone vs. Android Pricing

Several instances highlight price discrepancies where iPhone users are charged more than Android users for identical items:
*   In January 2025, on Zepto's Android app, 1 kg of onions was priced at ₹43, while on an iPhone, it cost ₹57 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.
*   Similarly, 500 grams of grapes were sold for ₹146 on iPhone, compared to ₹65 on Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   Zepto was also accused of pricing green bell peppers at ₹21 on Android phones, but ₹107 on iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   A tweet from December 2024 by Saurabh Sharma noted that a suitcase on Flipkart's Android app was priced at ₹4,119, while the same suitcase cost ₹4,799 on the iOS app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

### Subscription Fee Disparities

This [[misleading_marketing_tactics | price discrimination]] extends to subscription services:
*   A YouTube Premium subscription costs ₹195 on an iPhone, but only ₹149 on an Android device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   A Premium Plus subscription on Twitter is ₹2,299 per month on an iPhone, whereas on Android, it costs ₹2,150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

## Battery-Level Based Pricing

Cab booking apps have been observed to adjust prices based on a user's phone battery level, taking advantage of a user's urgency when their battery is low.
*   In a simulated scenario, a user with only 5% battery left on their phone quickly books a cab, finding the prices to be double the normal rate, assuming it's "surge pricing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, the app might have increased prices specifically because of the low battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   A 2023 study by a Belgian newspaper found that Uber was charging more for a taxi booking on a phone with 12% battery compared to one with 84% battery from the same location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Uber has denied this practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, in a 2016 interview with NPR, Keith Chen, Uber's Head of Economic Research, stated that Uber has identified that people are willing to pay more when their phone's battery is about to run out, and the Uber app can check device battery levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. He claimed this information was not used for pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   In January 2025, Rishabh Singh, founder of the Engineer Hub, conducted an experiment that confirmed Uber was charging more for cab bookings on devices with low battery levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Consumer Action

As customers, awareness and collective action are crucial to counter these tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Raising voices against such [[misleading_marketing_tactics | misleading marketing tactics]] through social media, emails, and short videos can pressure companies to take corrective actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. Governments are also urged to implement stricter regulations and penalize companies engaging in these practices, similar to actions taken in developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

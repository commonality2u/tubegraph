On August 21, 1911, a Monday morning in Paris, France, three men emerged from the Louvre Museum carrying a blanket-hidden property of the museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. They had spent the previous night inside the museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. After exiting, they went to a nearby railway station, caught a train at 8:45 AM, and disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The world was initially unaware that they had stolen the planet's most renowned painting: the [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Mona Lisa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Mastermind and Motive

The orchestrator of this significant theft was Vincenzo Peruggia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. He carried out the crime with two friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Peruggia was an employee of the Louvre Museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, and he hid in the museum overnight before walking out with the painting the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

Peruggia's motive was rooted in Italian nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. He believed that the [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Mona Lisa]], painted by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, rightfully belonged in an Italian museum, not in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. After the theft, he took the painting to Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Discovery and Recovery

The theft of such a valuable painting, estimated to be worth close to $1 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, instantly made headlines worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Numerous detectives were assigned to the case, but Peruggia remained unfound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

For two years, Peruggia kept the painting hidden in his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Growing impatient, he eventually attempted to sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a> to an art dealer in Florence named Giovanni Poggi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Poggi became suspicious and confirmed the painting's identity by checking its stamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. As a result, Peruggia was apprehended and sentenced to six months in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

The [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Mona Lisa]] was returned to the Louvre Museum on January 4, 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Today, it is displayed behind bulletproof glass in strictly climate-controlled conditions, with humidity maintained at 50% +/- 10% and temperature between 18°C and 21°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Impact on Fame

Perhaps the most remarkable outcome of the 1911 theft is its direct influence on the [[the_role_of_the_theft_in_increasing_the_fame_of_the_mona_lisa | Mona Lisa]]'s popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Before the incident, the painting was not widely famous outside of art circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. It was only after the theft that the [[the_role_of_the_theft_in_increasing_the_fame_of_the_mona_lisa | Mona Lisa]]'s renown skyrocketed, making it the world's most famous painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The crowds of people surrounding the painting at the Louvre Museum today can largely be attributed to Vincenzo Peruggia's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

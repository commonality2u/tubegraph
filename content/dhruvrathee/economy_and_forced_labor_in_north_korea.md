North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), operates under a family-led totalitarian dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:02">[07:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:02">[07:54:02]</a>. While the government attempts to control every aspect of its citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:03">[08:03:03]</a>, its economic policies and reliance on forced labor have led to severe hardships for the majority of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:04">[04:44:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:02">[20:32:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:06">[24:13:06]</a>.

## Historical Economic Context

North Korea's economic situation was not always dire. In 1980, its Per Capita GDP was higher than both India and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. Citizens received free healthcare, education, housing, heating, and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:02">[05:12:02]</a>. Between 1950 and 1980, North Korea's GDP grew by approximately 4.5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:07">[05:17:07]</a>.

However, the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s marked a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:02">[05:24:02]</a>. The Soviet Union had provided North Korea with cheap oil and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:07">[05:39:07]</a>. After the USSR's dissolution, North Korea's economy crashed, leading to power station shutdowns, blackouts, and widespread starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:03">[05:42:03]</a>. The USA offered aid on the condition of shutting down its nuclear weapons program, but North Korea refused, leading to international isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. A heavy flood in August 1995 further exacerbated the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:02">[06:02:02]</a>.

### The Famine of the 1990s
The famine in North Korea between 1995 and 1998 is considered one of the largest man-made catastrophes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:04">[04:44:04]</a>. While the exact number of deaths was never revealed, estimates range from 500,000 to 2 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:01">[04:51:01]</a>. During this period, people were so hungry they resorted to hunting frogs for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:02">[04:33:02]</a>. Andrew Natsios's book 'The Great North Korean Famine' notes that families allowed elderly relatives to starve so younger members could survive, with many grandparents choosing to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:07">[06:37:07]</a>. The government tried to cover up the crisis, removing homeless and starving people from the capital, Pyongyang, which was showcased as a model of socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:05">[06:15:05]</a>.

## Economic Hardship for Citizens

The economic condition of common people in North Korea is terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:02">[20:32:02]</a>. 69% of the population lacks money for basic necessities like food, clean water, education, and hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:05">[20:35:05]</a>. Most homes lack common appliances like fridges, washing machines, or even bicycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:05">[20:44:05]</a>.

A primary reason for this poverty is that almost all men are assigned government jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. Their salaries are still based on pre-1990s rates, equivalent to only 7-9 kg of corn per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. In 2014, a doctor who defected stated that a monthly salary of 3,500 won could not even buy 1 kg of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.

### Rise of Jangmadang (Black Markets)
Due to men's low earnings, women primarily support most families in North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>. Married women, not forced into government-assigned jobs, work at local markets called Jangmadang, contributing over 70% of household income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. These markets emerged after the government failed to provide food in the 1990s, becoming a crucial source of income and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>.

Jangmadang offer everything from food and drugs to illegal USBs containing South Korean films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>. They also serve as vital information hubs about other countries and the outside world, eroding the government's propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>. The growth of these markets has significantly weakened the government's control, as it was unable to suppress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:00">[32:16:00]</a>.

## Forced Labor

North Korea extensively uses forced labor, a form of modern-day slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:06">[24:13:06]</a>. This labor supports the entire economy, with people compelled to work 12-18 hours daily in construction, farms, mines, and factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>. Much of the nation's wealth is spent on weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>.

Most forced labor is performed by prisoners in detention centers and [[guilt_by_association_and_political_prison_camps_in_north_korea|political prison camps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>. North Korean law punishes accused individuals with years of forced labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>.

### Conditions in Political Prison Camps
The conditions in these camps are described as horrific, with prisoners often starved to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>. Around 30-40 prisoners are housed in a 50 square meter room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>. Prisoners are forced to work 16-18 hours daily in mines and farms for minimal food rations, causing approximately 40% of them to die of hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>. To survive, they resort to eating grass, rats, snakes, or even pig fodder, and meticulously collect fallen food crumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a>. Violations of camp rules are met with extreme brutality; a 7-year-old girl was beaten to death for eating fallen grains, and a prisoner was executed for stealing potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>. Those attempting to escape are killed by guards or electric fences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.

### Forced Labor Abroad
North Korea also sends its citizens for forced labor and slavery to countries like Russia, China, Gulf nations, Poland, and Africa, with about 100,000 North Koreans involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:43:00">[27:43:00]</a>. There are reports of North Korean soldiers being sent to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war on Russia's behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>.

## Economic Control and Corruption

The [[government_control_over_personal_lives_in_north_korea|government control over personal lives in North Korea]] extends to nearly all aspects, including who lives where, what work they do, and where they study, all dictated by the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. The Songbun system, a three-class system based on political loyalty, determines where individuals live, their occupation, food rations, healthcare, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>. Those from the "Hostile" class are not permitted within a 50 km radius of Pyongyang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>.

Bribery has become a pervasive part of [[daily_life_under_dictatorship_in_north_korea|daily life under dictatorship in North Korea]], with government officials often relying on bribes for their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:31:00]</a>. This widespread corruption means that strict dictatorial rules can often be circumvented by paying bribes, leading to a decline in people's fear of the government's rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>.

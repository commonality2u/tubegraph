Boeing, a prominent private company known for manufacturing airplanes, has recently faced significant challenges in both its aviation and space divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These issues range from software glitches and hardware defects in its spacecraft to manufacturing flaws in its commercial airliners.

## Boeing Starliner Spacecraft Issues

The Boeing Starliner spacecraft, still in its developing stage, was launched on June 5, 2024, for its final test mission, the Boeing Crew Flight Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This mission carried two experienced NASA astronauts, Commander Barry E. Wilmore and Pilot Sunita Williams, to the International Space Station (ISS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Despite a successful docking with the ISS, which made Boeing the second private company after [[spacex_versus_boeing_in_commercial_space_missions | SpaceX]] to make and fly a human orbital spacecraft, the mission soon encountered problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The initial 8-day mission was extended indefinitely, with the astronauts now projected to remain in space for eight months due to issues with the spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Pre-Launch and In-Flight Anomalies

The Starliner's launch faced multiple delays:
*   **Faulty Pressure Valve**: The original launch on May 6, 2024, was stopped two hours before countdown due to a faulty pressure valve in the Atlas V rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Computer Abort System**: A second attempt on June 1 was cancelled just four minutes before launch by a computer abort system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Helium Leaks**: Before the successful June 5 launch, engineers were managing a helium leak caused by a defective seal, which is crucial for the spacecraft's propulsion system and thrusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. After launch, two more leaks were discovered, followed by a fourth leak upon reaching the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Boeing's Commercial Crew Program Manager admitted uncertainty about the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Thruster Malfunctions**: Hours before docking, 5 out of 28 thrusters on the Starliner were not working properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Commander Barry Wilmore had to manually control the spacecraft, and after resetting, 4 of the 5 thrusters began working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Post-docking tests revealed that these thrusters were overheating due to direct sunlight exposure on the manual control system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Due to these persistent issues, NASA decided that the [[boeing_starliner_spacecraft_mission_issues | Boeing Starliner spacecraft mission issues]] would return to Earth uncrewed, with the astronauts remaining on the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. They will be returned on a [[spacex_versus_boeing_in_commercial_space_missions | SpaceX]] Crew Dragon spacecraft in February 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This decision prioritized safety, avoiding a repeat of past tragedies like the 2003 [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | Challenger disaster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Prior Test Failures
*   **Orbital Flight Test (2019)**: The first uncrewed test flight on December 20, 2019, was aborted after just two days, failing to dock with the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. An investigation found that the thrusters could not fire on time due to a computer system's miscalibration of timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. NASA's Steve Stich noted insufficient oversight to Boeing regarding software problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **Orbital Flight Test 2 (2022)**: While this test on May 19, 2022, was successful in reaching the ISS, it also experienced glitches, including thrusters not operating properlyâ€”the same problem seen in the 2024 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

Notably, when NASA awarded contracts for its Commercial Crew Program in 2014, Boeing's contract was worth $4.2 billion, significantly more than [[spacex_versus_boeing_in_commercial_space_missions | SpaceX]]'s $2.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

## Aviation Division Challenges

Boeing's problems extend beyond space into its commercial aviation sector, particularly with its 737 MAX aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### Recent Incidents (2024)
*   **Alaska Airlines Door Plug Incident**: On January 5, 2024, a door plug on an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX broke apart mid-flight at 16,000 feet, causing rapid decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration found the cause to be loose hardware, specifically bolts that needed additional tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. Following this, Alaska Airlines and United Airlines grounded their 737 MAX fleets, revealing loose parts in many Boeing airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This highlights concerns about [[airplane_structural_fatigue_and_corrosion | airplane structural fatigue and corrosion]] or general manufacturing quality control.

### Prior Fatal Crashes (2018-2019)
*   **Lion Air Flight 610 (2018)**: A faulty sensor led to the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia, killing all passengers and crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (2019)**: A similar incident occurred with Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, also resulting in fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Investigations revealed that problematic software installed by Boeing took control away from pilots, leading to the crashes despite their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

These incidents led to a 20-month grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX planes globally for safety re-evaluation, with them re-entering service only after December 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

Boeing's CEO has announced his resignation by the end of 2024 amidst these ongoing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The recurring problems in both its space and aviation divisions suggest systemic challenges within the company regarding quality control and software reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

Mass hysteria, also known as Mass Psychogenic Illness, is a psychological phenomenon where a group of people exhibit unusual, irrational behavior, believe in illogical things, and experience irrational feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[01:47]</a>. It is a contagious form of human behavior, spreading quickly among people, particularly in tightly-knit communities where individuals care about and are friendly with each other, such as neighbors and extended family members in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[12:00]</a>. Triggers for mass hysteria can include stress, anxiety, environmental factors, and psychological factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[12:18]</a>.

## The Delhi Monkey-Man Incident (2001)

The phenomenon of mass hysteria was notably observed during the "Monkey-Man" incidents in Delhi and its neighboring areas in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[10:30]</a>.

### Initial Attacks and Spread of Fear

On April 5, 2001, in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, a man named Anil Gopal was attacked while sleeping on his rooftop. He described his attacker as a monkey-like figure that disappeared into the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Similar incidents followed, with victims like Vinod and Raihasuddin also reporting attacks by a monkey-like creature, leading to widespread terror of the "black monkey" across Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Between April and May 2001, Delhi Police received approximately 100 calls from people claiming to be attacked by the Monkey-Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Reports came from Ghaziabad, East Delhi, Noida, and other parts of Delhi, consistently describing sudden attacks at night, leaving scratches, injuries, and bite marks, with the attacker disappearing without a trace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Varied Descriptions of the Monkey-Man

Victims' descriptions of the Monkey-Man varied greatly because no one had seen him up close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Initial accounts suggested a more human-like figure, with one victim describing him as fair-complexioned, with blue eyes and a big nose, possibly of Nepali origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Later, descriptions leaned more towards a monkey-like creature, with varied heights (8 feet tall, 4-5 feet tall, or even like a housecat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Popular descriptions included wearing a helmet, a t-shirt with buttons that granted powers (turning into a monkey, super strength, invisibility), long, sharp, metallic nails, red eyes, and the ability to jump incredibly high (e.g., 20 feet between roofs), possibly with springs on his feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. With each new incident, the Monkey-Man's description became increasingly supernatural, leading people to believe he was a shapeshifter to mislead and confuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Public Impact and Panic

The widespread terror of the Monkey-Man led to three deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. When shouts of "Monkey-Man is coming, run for your lives!" echoed, people would run in panic, often hurting themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Dozens suffered fractures, with one person dying from jumping off a rooftop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. A pregnant woman died after slipping from stairs in terror after merely seeing a shadow she assumed was the Monkey-Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

The fear turned into paranoia, causing people to stop sleeping outdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Minor things like shadows or random sounds would lead to police calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Vigilante groups armed with sticks formed to patrol areas, but their paranoia led them to attack innocent people, mistaking them for the Monkey-Man. One incident involved 150 people attacking a man who was later found innocent, and another saw a van driver severely injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Police Involvement and Decline of Incidents

Facing the widespread panic, Delhi Police deployed over 3,000 officers to "hotspot" areas and ensured uninterrupted power supply to alleviate environmental stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. They even released two different sketches of the Monkey-Man based on victims' descriptions, describing him as more human than monkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A reward of â‚¹50,000 was offered for information leading to his arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

After May 25, 2001, the incidents slowly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[19:17]</a>. Police took strict action against fake calls and issued warnings that spreading rumors or misleading them would lead to jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Out of 379 calls received, 303 were fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Several people were arrested for spreading false rumors, including a doctor who inflated a surgical glove, painted it brown, and claimed it was the Monkey-Man's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This deterred people from making false reports, and the media eventually lost interest, leading to the complete cessation of incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[10:14]</a>.

### Scientific Explanation of the Phenomenon

Doctors S.K. Verma and D.K. Srivastava from Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in New Delhi investigated 397 calls related to Monkey-Man attacks and found that only 51 warranted medical examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[12:24]</a>. Their 2003 study in the *Indian Journal of Medical Sciences* classified the Monkey-Man case as a typical example of mass hysteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[12:43]</a>.

#### Triggers and Contributing Factors

*   **Triggers:** The primary trigger was a shadow or random sound at night, which people believed to be the Monkey-Man, spreading fear like a virus among families and neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[13:01]</a>.
*   **High Population Density:** Incidents occurred in high-population density areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[13:26]</a>.
*   **Socio-Economic Status:** 94% of the victims were from poorer sections of society, living in low socio-economic locales. Less educated individuals tend to be more superstitious and rely on imagination, readily believing made-up stories when surrounded by others who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_media_in_spreading_mass_hysteria | Role of Media]]:** The Indian media played a crucial role in spreading the "virus" of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[14:14]</a>. Newly established private news channels in 2001 competed for viewership, sensationalizing the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[14:18]</a>. People, eager for media attention, made up false stories to appear on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[14:14]</a>. At the time, people blindly believed news channels, assuming anything shown was true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[14:54]</a>. The police also blamed the media for the mass hysteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[15:19]</a>.
*   **Psychological and Environmental Stress:** Mass hysteria cases are common among those suffering from psychological or environmental stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[15:23]</a>. Two-thirds of Monkey-Man attack cases involved men aged 20-30 in low-income, stressful jobs, experiencing high physical stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[15:34]</a>. The summer heat and frequent power cuts also contributed to significant environmental stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[15:47]</a>.

#### Explaining the Injuries

While the injuries reported by victims were real, investigations by Delhi Police and doctors concluded they were not from a supernatural Monkey-Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[16:24]</a>. Bite marks were attributed to rodents and stray dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[16:50]</a>. Most scratches were caused by blunt objects, likely from people running in panic in the dark and colliding with objects or falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[16:53]</a>. A significant portion of attacks (two-thirds) occurred between midnight and 6 AM, during power cuts, when people were in deep sleep and would run in disorientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[17:06]</a>.

#### Mass Self-Delusion and False Reports

The Indian Rationalist Association suggested some Monkey-Man cases were instances of "Mass Self-Delusion," where attention-seeking individuals intentionally inflicted injuries to gain media attention and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[17:23]</a>. Delhi Police also suspected that people from areas with frequent power cuts were making false Monkey-Man reports to ensure electricity restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[17:43]</a>. Authorities noticed a pattern: restoring electricity in reported Monkey-Man areas would calm the situation, as people would go inside to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[18:10]</a>.

## Other Examples of Mass Hysteria

Mass hysteria is a recurring phenomenon globally:

*   **England's Spring-Heeled Jack (1837-1904):** People in London believed a man in a trench coat with red eyes and metal nails scratched women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[18:53]</a>. No trace of him was ever found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[19:10]</a>.
*   **India's Braid Chopping Incidents (2017):** In Haryana and Delhi, women reported fainting and waking up to find their braids chopped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[19:14]</a>.

These incidents, like the Monkey-Man, typically occur in areas with less educated, poor, and superstitious populations, exacerbated by psychological/environmental stress and the spread of rumors, often amplified by media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[19:26]</a>.

This article compares the international standing and influence of India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, drawing directly from claims and counter-claims presented in the provided transcript.

## Claims Regarding India's International Standing Post-2014

Since May 2014, claims have been made that the world began to acknowledge India anew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Pro-government media and supporters often assert that India has become a world leader due to the [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles | Modi government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, and that its international renown is a recent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Prime Minister Modi and his supporters claim that before 2014, India was "a barren jungle" and that its popularity surged after May 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. There was also a claim that Indians lacked cultural confidence and were ashamed of themselves before 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### "When India Speaks, the Whole World Listens"

This phrase has been reiterated by PM Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, BJP leader Rajnath Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, and former Foreign Minister Late Sushma Swaraj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, implying that before 2014, India was not listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

However, the original statement, "When Manmohan Singh speaks, the whole world listens," was made by former US President Barack Obama for Dr. Manmohan Singh, praising his deep understanding of economics and acknowledging India's emergence as a superpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Assertions of Popularising Indian Culture and Achievements

*   **Konark Sun Temple**: Home Minister Amit Shah stated that PM Modi popularized Konark's Sun Temple worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. However, UNESCO's official website indicates Konark's temple became a World Heritage Site in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **International Yoga Day**: Rajnath Singh and Mansukh Mandaviya claimed Yoga's international celebration is due to the Modi government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. While PM Modi's efforts led the UN to proclaim June 21st as International Yoga Day in December 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, Yoga's "universal appeal" was recognized before May 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Yoga was practiced globally decades prior, with figures like Justin Trudeau (2013) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, Baba Ramdev (2007) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, and Yehudi Menuhin (since 1952, introduced by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru via B.K.S. Iyengar) popularizing it internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Swami Vivekananda first introduced Yoga spiritually in the West, and many gurus like Indira Devi and K. Pattabhi Jois contributed to its fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Stopping Wars**: Pro-government channels claimed PM Modi stopped the war between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> and paused the war on Gaza for Ramadan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. The transcript states that "nothing of this sort ever happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> and that both wars are ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

### [[influence_on_indian_media_and_political_environment | Media Portrayal]] and International Rankings

## Jawaharlal Nehru's International Standing and Influence

Before 2014, India was already a major global player. In terms of purchasing power parity, India was the third-largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, and the 10th largest in nominal terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. India had already won Oscars, Nobel Prizes, Booker Prizes, Ramon Magsaysay Awards, Olympic medals, and Cricket World Cups by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### State Visits and Global Acclaim

Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, received unprecedented welcome during his state visits:
*   **United States**: In October 1949, President Harry Truman personally received Nehru at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, honoring him with a 19-gun salute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Truman praised Nehru as a "respected and loved leader of a great nation of free people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Later visits in 1956 and 1961 saw Nehru meet Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, with Kennedy also receiving him at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union**: In 1955, Nehru received an extraordinary welcome, with Nikolai Bulganin personally greeting him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

Even though India was a newly independent, poor country post-British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, Nehru garnered global respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. He was beloved in America, Canada, Mexico, the Soviet Union, UK, France, Poland, Vietnam, Indonesia, Egypt, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Influence on World Leaders and Thinkers

Nehru's influence extended to many international figures:
*   **Tomio Mizokami**: Japanese author and Padma Shri awardee, stated he chose to learn Hindi because of Nehru, calling him a leader with "great influence in the world" and an "ideal for world peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Martin Luther King Jr.** called Nehru "a man of three extraordinary eras," praising his leadership in anti-colonial struggles, his fight for peace after WWII, and his establishment of India's peaceful stance amidst Cold War struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. King emphasized that the world needed an "honest mediator" with "reputation, wisdom, and courage," which Nehru possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   **Nelson Mandela**: The South African leader considered Nehru his hero, studied his writings, and even derived his autobiography's title, *Long Walk to Freedom*, from a Nehru quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Aung San Suu Kyi**: The Nobel Prize winner and Myanmar's leader felt closest to Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru among Indian leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

### Policy of Non-Alignment and Global Leadership

Nehru's foreign policy was based on India's inherent "mental outlook" of peace and non-alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.
*   **Bandung Conference (1955)**: Nehru's speech questioned why Asian and African nations should align with communist or anti-communist blocs, asserting their independent ideological leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)**: Its groundwork began with the Bandung Conference, leading to the first NAM conference in Belgrade in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This movement, now comprising 120 countries, remains relevant globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
*   **UN Security Council**: Nehru rejected offers of a permanent seat in the UN Security Council from both the US and Soviet Union, believing it would weaken the UN and increase war possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. He chose to lead a third group of non-aligned nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### Stance Against Apartheid and Support for Africa

Nehru openly spoke against apartheid in Africa at the Bandung Conference, highlighting the tragedy of slavery and advocating for Asia to help Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. He created scholarships for Africans, leading to over 600 African students studying in India by 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Notable beneficiaries included John Samuel Malecela (later PM of Tanzania), Olusegun Obasanjo (military head of state, then elected president of Nigeria), and Bingu wa Mutharika (later President of Malawi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

### Promotion of Science and Culture

Government initiatives under Nehru fostered India's soft power:
*   Lalit Kala Academy (1954) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>
*   Sangeet Natak Academy (1952) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>
*   National School of Drama (1959) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>
*   Film Institute Pune (1960) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>
*   Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (1954) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>
*   Establishment of ISRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>

Nehru also engaged with world-renowned scientists like Albert Einstein and Vikram Sarabhai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

The transcript suggests a contrasting picture of India's international standing under the two leaders. While [[narendra_modis_image_and_cult_of_personality | PM Modi's supporters]] portray a new era of global recognition for India, the transcript highlights a decline in various international indices and increased global criticism of India's human rights record and democratic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. In contrast, Jawaharlal Nehru, despite leading a newly independent and poor nation, earned significant global respect through his policies of non-alignment, advocacy for peace, and support for decolonization, leading to India being a respected voice on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. The article implies that to achieve a high international standing, leaders should strive to "raise one's level" rather than attempting to "pull down" historical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

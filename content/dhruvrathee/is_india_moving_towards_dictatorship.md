The question of whether democracy is still alive in India is a serious one, prompting a deeper examination beyond the simple fact of regular elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While some might believe that the ability to vote for any political party confirms democracy's existence, a closer look at recent incidents suggests a concerning shift towards a "One Nation, One Party" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This includes actions such as eradicating opposition voices from the media, alleged horse-trading of MLAs, taking power from elected governments through new laws, weaponization of investigative agencies, pressuring and imprisoning opposition politicians, interfering in state governments, withholding funds, and suppressing the [[protests_and_citizens_rights_in_india | right of citizens to protest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Defining Democracy

Many people misunderstand the concept of democracy, often believing that regular elections and the ability to vote are sufficient indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. However, elections are also held in countries widely considered dictatorships, such as North Korea, which even includes "Democratic" in its official name (Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In North Korea, failure to vote for the official candidate can lead to severe repercussions like job or home loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Similarly, elections in Russia are held, but candidates who challenge the ruling party are often disqualified or face mysterious deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Therefore, merely having elections does not equate to democracy; elections must be free and fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. "Free" implies the freedom to vote for one's chosen candidate, while "fair" means that different candidates and political parties have an equitable chance of winning, without one party holding significant advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Recent incidents raise [[preservation_of_democracy_and_challenges_to_electoral_integrity_in_india | concerns about the integrity of elections in India]]:
*   **Chandigarh Municipal Corporation Mayor elections** In February 2024, the presiding officer allegedly invalidated eight votes from the Congress and AAP alliance, despite their clear majority, leading to the BJP being declared the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This alleged election fraud was captured on CCTV, prompting the Chief Justice of India to call it a "murder of democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The Supreme Court later had to intervene to save the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **EVM Malpractices** In 2021, an EVM machine was found in a BJP candidate's car in Assam, leading to a re-poll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. In February 2024, three unknown individuals attempted to steal an EVM control unit from a Tehsil office in Pune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Allegations of Election Commission Bias

The Election Commission (EC) is expected to conduct free and fair elections, but it has faced accusations of partiality and bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Historical Accusations** Even current Prime Minister Modi accused the Election Commission of bias before the May 2014 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Recent Bias Claims** In the last decade, critics like Prashant Kishore have called the EC an "extension of BJP," claiming it has bent rules and scheduled elections to benefit the ruling party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Violation of Campaign Rules** Despite clear directions against mentioning the Indian Army in political campaigns, PM Modi asked for votes using martyrs and airstrikes before the 2019 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath even referred to the Indian Army as "Modi's Army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Complaints filed with the EC on these matters received no action for 21 days, followed by clean chits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. PM Modi received clean chits in at least four such cases, and along with Amit Shah, received clean chits in seven cases, despite one Election Commissioner having a dissenting opinion in five of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Removal of Dissenting Commissioner** Ashok Lavasa, the dissenting Election Commissioner, later had his family members receive notices from government agencies, and a Citizen Commission on Elections report stated he was "silently removed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Changes to EC Appointments** The Supreme Court had ordered that the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners be appointed by a three-member committee including the Prime Minister, opposition leader, and Chief Justice of India, to ensure independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. However, a few months ago, the government passed a new law removing the Chief Justice of India from this committee, replacing him with a government minister, effectively allowing the government to control appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The Supreme Court did not strike down this law, citing separation of powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Campaign Finance Violations** The Election Commission sets spending limits for elections (e.g., ₹9.5 million for an MP election) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, the BJP's reported spending in the last elections (₹12.64 billion) far exceeded its limit for 437 seats (₹4.15 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The Center for Media Studies estimated BJP's total expenditure at ₹270 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Electoral bonds worth ₹160 billion have been sold, with over ₹100 billion going to BJP, vastly surpassing spending limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. These financial disparities make it extremely difficult for social workers or smaller parties to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## [[challenges_to_indian_democracy_and_opposition | Challenges to Indian Democracy and Opposition]]

Even when opposition parties manage to form governments, they face significant obstacles.
*   **Horse-Trading** Numerous allegations of "horse-trading" have been levied against the BJP, accusing them of buying MLAs with "unimaginable amounts of money" to destabilize elected governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Weaponization of Investigative Agencies** Investigative agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are allegedly used as tools against opposition leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. In the last year, 14 political parties complained to the Supreme Court about over 3,000 raids on political leaders, a four-fold jump since 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Targeting Opposition Politicians** 95% of ED cases against politicians are registered against opposition parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. While the ED claims a high conviction rate (96%), this is based on only 25 cases out of over 5,900 registered since 2005, meaning only 0.5% of cases are substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **"Washing Powder Modi"** A recurring pattern is that once an opposition politician accused of corruption joins the BJP, all charges and cases against them "vanish suddenly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Examples include Himanta Biswa Sharma, who faced corruption allegations while in Congress but no investigations since joining BJP, despite new allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Many such politicians were previously cited by PM Modi as examples of corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Imprisonment Without Conviction** Opposition politicians who do not join the ruling party are often jailed for months without conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. AAP MP Raghav Chadda asserted that if jailed opposition leaders like Manish Sisodia and Satyendra Jain joined BJP, their cases would be dismissed, and they would be released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### Interference in State Governments

States with opposition governments have repeatedly accused the Modi government of using governors to interfere in day-to-day affairs and prevent them from working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Governor Obstruction** West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Kerala governments have made these accusations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The Kerala government accused its governor of delaying bills passed by the state legislature for two years, prompting the Supreme Court to declare such delays unconstitutional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Delhi Government Powers Reduced** The conflict between the LG and the Delhi government has been prolonged, with CM Kejriwal repeatedly stating they are prevented from working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Although the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the elected government, stating real power should be with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, the Central Government responded by passing the GNCTD (Amendment) Act, 2023, which transferred many powers from the Delhi government to the LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Suppression of Dissent and [[influence_on_indian_media_and_political_environment | Media Control]]

A core tenet of democracy is the right to protest and an independent media that holds the government accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Curbing Protests** The [[protests_and_citizens_rights_in_india | right to protest]] is increasingly curtailed. When farmers protested recently, they were met with sharp nails, dug-up roads, rubber bullets, and tear gas drones, creating a "war zone" atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. Reports indicate at least three farmers were blinded by rubber bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Similar treatment was seen during the wrestlers' protest and the previous farmers' protest, where at least 600 farmers lost their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Many other protests, such as those by Kashmiri Pandits, government employees, and unemployed youth, receive minimal media coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **[[influence_on_indian_media_and_political_environment | Media Bias and Lack of Accountability]]**
    *   **Praise for Government** The media is often accused of constantly praising the government and repeating its talking points, with TV anchors acting as spokespersons for the ruling party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
    *   **Lack of Press Conferences** PM Modi has held zero unscripted press conferences, where accountability is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. In contrast, former PM Dr. Manmohan Singh held or addressed the press 117 times, with his last proper press conference over 10 years ago involving 62 unscripted questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
    *   **Censorship and Acquisitions** NDTV, one of the last channels to question the government, was taken over by Gautam Adani, an associate of PM Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. The government reportedly uses tax money to fund 'advertisements' on TV channels that then suppress citizens' voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
    *   **Suppressed News** Significant events like the 77-day unrest in Manipur received no special reports on TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Similarly, 12 CAG reports revealing irregularities and corruption in government departments, such as 900,000 Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries using only 3 mobile numbers or millions spent on treatment for 3,400 deceased patients, were not widely reported, and CAG officers were transferred after the reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

## Democracy vs. Majoritarianism

Another misunderstanding is confusing democracy with majoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. True democracy involves principles of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and Justice, as outlined in the Preamble to the Indian Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. A majority vote does not grant the right to strip away natural rights, discriminate, or impose irrational rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Examples of Majoritarianism** Local examples include society rules in Gurgaon banning two-wheelers or discriminating against air hostesses for rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. In Noida, some societies impose entry and exit fees for tenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. These rules, though imposed by elected management, highlight how majoritarianism can lead to arbitrary or discriminatory practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
*   **Unconstitutional Decisions** Some government decisions are considered unconstitutional, like the Electoral Bonds Scheme, which the Supreme Court struck down, calling it an "arbitrary rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Constitutional Principles and Accountability

Holding the government accountable is not solely the Supreme Court's duty, but also the responsibility of the opposition, media, civil society, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. Mechanisms like the Right to Information (RTI) Act exist for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.
*   **Citizen Action** A positive example of citizen power occurred recently in Uttar Pradesh, where the government initially banned coaching classes for girls after 8 pm for "safety" reasons, effectively putting girls in cages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. However, protests by citizens led the UP government to withdraw the ban, demonstrating the power of the people in a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

The incidents highlighted, including issues with electoral integrity, challenges to the opposition, interference in state governance, suppression of dissent, and media control, collectively point towards [[concerns_about_dictatorship_in_india | concerns about dictatorship in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. If these trends continue, India risks deteriorating to the level of countries like North Korea and Russia, where democracy exists only on paper, and in reality, has "breathed its last breath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

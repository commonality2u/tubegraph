World War I, which lasted four years and resulted in over 20 million deaths, was not triggered by a single incident, but rather by a "long and complex chain of reasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The assassination of the Austro-Hungarian Prince on June 28, 1914, by a 19-year-old student, was merely the "spark" that ignited the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## European Political Landscape (1914)

In 1914, the map of Europe was dominated by large empires:
*   **Austro-Hungarian Empire** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   **German Empire** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   **Russian Empire** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
*   **Ottoman Empire** (in present-day Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   The United Kingdom and France were also significant powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Poland did not exist as a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Most European countries were monarchies at this time, with rulers making key decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Only France, Switzerland, and San Marino were democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The monarchs paid "no heed to the people's opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Notably, the rulers of Germany (Kaiser Wilhelm II), Russia (Tsar Nicholas II), and Britain (King George V) were first cousins, making World War I akin to a "Game of Thrones" or "family feud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The **Balkan Countries** (Serbia, Bosnia, Romania, and Bulgaria) were crucial to the unfolding events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Many people in Eastern Europe, particularly those identifying as South Slavs, desired a united South Slavic nation, or Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Bosnian Crisis and Diplomatic Maneuvers

The story begins in 1878 with the **Russo-Turkish War**, where Russia aided Balkan countries in separating from the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The war concluded with the **Treaty of Berlin** in 1878, which granted the Austro-Hungarian Empire the temporary right to administer Bosnia-Herzegovina, though it officially remained part of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

However, in October 1908, the Austro-Hungarian Empire unilaterally annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This act angered the Bosnians, who desired freedom, and infuriated neighboring Serbia due to their shared Slavic ethnicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Serbia viewed the annexation as an invasion of the South Slavs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Before the annexation, Austria-Hungary's foreign minister had a secret agreement with Russia's foreign minister: Russia would not object to the annexation of Bosnia in exchange for Austro-Hungarian support for Russia gaining control of the Strait of Bosphorus (connecting the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. However, Russian public protests against the control of Slavic people by the Austro-Hungarian Empire forced Russia to backtrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

In 1909, the Austro-Hungarian Empire sought Germany's assurance of help if Russia interfered in a potential invasion of Serbia, which Germany agreed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Russia, in turn, asked France for support against the Austro-Hungarian-German alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. France, however, refused to interfere, leading Russia to accept the annexation of Bosnia, and temporarily averting a major conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## The Assassination and the "Chain of Friendship"

The Bosnians, seeking freedom and unification with Serbia to form Yugoslavia, did not meekly accept annexation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. A revolutionary student group, the "Young Bosnia," supported by Serbians, aimed to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

On June 28, 1914, Austro-Hungarian Prince Ferdinand and his wife Sophie visited annexed Bosnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. After an initial failed bomb attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, they were assassinated by Gavrilo Princip, a 19-year-old student and Yugoslav Nationalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Enraged, the Austro-Hungarian emperor declared war on Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This act triggered a "Chain of Friendship" among the European powers:
*   Russia intervened to "save" Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   Germany intervened to "save" the Austro-Hungarian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   France supported Russia and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   Italy, though part of an alliance with Austria-Hungary and Germany, reneged on its agreement because the latter initiated the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   The Ottoman Empire, due to its enmity with Russia, supported the Austro-Hungarian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   The United Kingdom joined the conflict due to its Triple Entente alliance with Russia and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

This led to the Great War, with further involvement from countries like the USA and Japan supporting Britain and France, and countries under British rule, such as India, also participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Underlying Reasons for Conflict

Beyond the immediate triggers, four main reasons explain why countries were eager to engage in war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>:

### 1. Nationalism and Imperialism
*   **Nationalism**: Not based on liberation or independence, but on an aggressive, race-based belief in the superiority of one's own country and an aggressive attitude toward others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Rulers exploited this sentiment to encourage people to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Imperialism**: The desire to capture and occupy other countries for "pride," "power," and to "exploit the resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This was seen as the "highest stage of capitalism," where raw materials and cheap labor were exploited for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### 2. Militarism
*   Imperialism necessitated significant military spending to invade more countries by "brute force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   The combined military spending of Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Italy increased fourfold from £94 million in 1870 to £376 million by 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### 3. Alliances
*   **Triple Alliance** (formed 1882): Germany, Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Italy pledged mutual support if any of them were attacked by a Great Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Triple Entente** (formed 1907): Great Britain, France, and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   These alliances were primarily driven by [[role_of_nationalism_and_imperialism_in_world_war_i | Imperialism]] and the fear that rival countries would capture more territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Anti-War Sentiments

Despite the eagerness of rulers to go to war, the common people generally did not desire World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Soldiers, often poor and seeking employment, were motivated by money rather than a desire to conquer other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

Propaganda played a significant role in glorifying war and soldiers, portraying military service as a noble and selfless act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Newspapers and media exaggerated heroic acts to encourage enlistment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

However, not everyone was swayed. Various groups and individuals opposed the war:
*   Socialist parties in America, Italy, Britain (Labour Party), and Russia (Bolsheviks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
*   Anarchists and Syndicalists who believed in internationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   Individuals like Henry Ford and Valentine Bulgakov opposed it on religious and humanitarian grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
*   Poets and intellectuals, such as Rudyard Kipling and Wilfred Owen, exposed the harsh realities and inhumane conditions of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Thomas Hardy's poem "The Man He Killed" highlighted the arbitrary nature of conflict between common soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

These anti-war sentiments led to cases of mutinies, with soldiers refusing to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The most notable example was the **Christmas Truce of 1914**, where British and German soldiers temporarily ceased fighting to celebrate Christmas together on the battlefield, exchanging food and singing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Commanders eventually ordered them to resume fighting, punishing those who refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

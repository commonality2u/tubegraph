On March 8, 2014, [[disappearance_of_malaysian_airlines_flight_mh370 | Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370]], carrying 227 passengers, 10 flight attendants, and 2 pilots, departed Kuala Lumpur for Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. After 20 minutes of normal flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, and a final "Good night. MAS 370" from Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, the flight disappeared from radar at 01:21 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This sudden [[disappearance_of_malaysian_airlines_flight_mh370 | disappearance]] became the biggest aviation mystery in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Initial Search Efforts

An emergency response began four hours after the plane’s disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. By 06:32 AM, the time MH370 was scheduled to land in Beijing, a [[Search and Rescue Operations | search operation]] was immediately launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Initially, search efforts focused on the South China Sea, where the plane was last seen on civilian radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This was an international endeavor, involving 34 ships and 28 aircraft from 7 different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Despite the extensive resources, no trace of the plane was found in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Expanding the Search: Military Radar and Satellite Data

Four days later, on March 12, new information emerged from military radar data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This data indicated that MH370 was last spotted at 02:22 AM, not over the South China Sea, but near the Andaman and Nicobar islands, west of Malaysia, flying north towards India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Further investigation utilized satellite data, which revealed that the plane had attempted to automatically communicate with a satellite seven times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. While no specific location data was transmitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, scientists and investigators used the satellite's antenna angle during these "Satellite Handshakes" to approximate the plane's possible location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

This led to the identification of the "7th Arc," a massive curved area 2,000 km west of Australia in the Southern Indian Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Calculations based on the plane's speed and remaining fuel suggested that MH370 likely crashed somewhere along this arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This region was largely unexplored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Extensive Deep Ocean Search Operations

By April 2014, surface searches were halted, and deep ocean searches commenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This became the largest and most expensive [[Search and Rescue Operations | search operation]] ever conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. For three years, search teams scoured vast areas of the ocean floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. After spending $160 million, the operation was called off in 2017, deemed a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Debris Discovery

Despite the primary search ending without success, the first piece of debris confirmed to be from MH370 was found in July 2015 on Réunion Island, east of Madagascar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This piece was identified as the plane's flaperon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. To date, 27 pieces of the plane have been recovered from various islands worldwide, which aligns with drift analysis of ocean currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

### Ocean Infinity's Subsequent Search

In 2018, an American company named Ocean Infinity signed a "no find, no fee" contract with the Malaysian government to conduct a new [[Search and Rescue Operations | search operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Using highly advanced underwater surveillance vehicles, they mapped the ocean floor within the 7th Arc, discovering numerous underwater volcanoes, cliffs, and mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Despite their advanced technology, this mission also concluded without finding the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## New Hope for Locating MH370

In 2022, retired aerospace engineer Richard Godfrey claimed to have solved the mystery of MH370's location using [[new_technology_and_methods_in_locating_mh370 | new technology and methods in locating MH370]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. His methodology combines data from British Inmarsat Satellite, Boeing figures, Australian oceanographers, and the WSPRnet amateur radio wave technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. This technology uses the reflections of radio waves to predict an airplane's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

Godfrey developed a computer program that recognizes flight paths through weak radio signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. According to his calculations, MH370 lies precisely on the 7th Arc, 4 km underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While this area was part of previous searches, Godfrey believes it may have been missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. He has pinpointed the exact location with an accuracy of 40 nautical miles and proposed a new [[Search and Rescue Operations | search operation]] within this smaller radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. This new proposal offers a potential solution to the long-standing mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

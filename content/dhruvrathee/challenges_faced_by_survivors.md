The survivors of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 faced numerous immediate and long-term [[challenges_and_incidents_during_apollo_13 | challenges]] following their plane crash in the Andes Mountains on October 13, 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Out of 45 total passengers, only 33 were alive after the initial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath and Medical Needs
Many survivors were injured, and their precise location was unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Two medical students, 19-year-old Roberto Canessa and 20-year-old Gustavo Zerbino, immediately began checking on and assisting the injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Injuries were severe, including a skull fracture suffered by 23-year-old Fernando Parrado, who was in a coma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## Harsh Environment and Shelter
The crash occurred in the Andes at a height of 3,570 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, a region where most passengers, being from coastal areas, had never experienced snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. They faced temperatures as low as -30° Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. Five injured passengers succumbed to the cold on the first snowy night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

Survivors used the remaining body of the plane as a shelter, closing the rear with luggage, seats, and snow to stay warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. They also repurposed seat cushions as snowshoes and wool from seat covers for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

## Search and Rescue Difficulties
Search and rescue operations began within an hour of the plane's disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. However, the white aircraft had crashed in an area surrounded by white snow and ice, making it extremely difficult to locate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Despite efforts from 11 different aircraft from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, the crash site remained undiscovered. Survivors attempted to signal by writing "SOS" with lipstick on the plane's roof, but lacked enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. They also tried to make a large cross in the snow with suitcases, but this was ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. They observed three aircraft flying overhead but could not attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

Eight days after the crash, on October 21, search and rescue teams officially ceased their operation, believing there was little chance of survivors after so many days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. When survivors discovered this news via a functional transistor radio 11 days after the crash, their morale plummeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

## Resource Scarcity
### Water
Water was crucial for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. A passenger named Fito Strauch devised a method to melt snow using a metal sheet as a solar collector, collecting water droplets in empty wine bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

### Food
By the 11th day, food supplies were nearly exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. They initially had limited provisions: 8 chocolate bars, 1 tin of mussels, 3 small jars of jam, a jar of almonds, a box of peanuts, some dates, candies, dried plums, and a few bottles of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. Rationing efforts meant some survivors, like Parrado, ate only one chocolate-covered peanut for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. At 3,800 meters altitude, there were no trees, plants, or animals to hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. Attempts to eat cotton or leather from the seats only led to illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. Faced with starvation, the survivors made the difficult decision to consume the bodies of their deceased friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

## Additional Disasters
On October 29, 16 days after the crash, an avalanche struck, filling the broken plane with snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. Eight more people suffocated, reducing the number of survivors to 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. The remaining survivors were trapped in a small space under the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. Parrado used a metal pole to create a ventilation hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>, and after two days of digging, they managed to reach the surface, only to face an approaching snowstorm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.

## The Journey for Help
Realizing no one was coming to rescue them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>, three of the strongest survivors – Canessa, Parrado, and Vizintin – decided to trek for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. Their initial estimation of their location was severely mistaken; they believed they were a few kilometers from Chile, but were actually 89 km east in the middle of the Andes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.

### Technical Limitations
They found the plane's two-way radio system in the rear section of the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. However, they faced the [[challenges_faced_by_boeing_in_aerospace | challenge]] of incompatible power systems: the aircraft's electrical system ran on 115V AC, while their found battery was 24V DC, making it impossible to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.

### Hazardous Trek
On December 12, 60 days after the crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>, Parrado, Canessa, and Vizintin set out without any mountaineering gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. They lacked technical gear, maps, compasses, or climbing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. They wore multiple layers of clothing to combat the intense cold, such as Parrado's three pairs of jeans, three sweaters, four pairs of socks, and a plastic shopping bag over his socks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. At high altitudes, they also experienced the debilitating effects of thin air and lack of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>.

Another [[challenges_faced_by_independent_and_smallbudget_films | challenge]] was snow blindness, caused by the sun's ultraviolet rays reflecting off the snow and ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. They only had three pairs of sunglasses among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. An 18-year-old survivor, Carlos Miguel Rodriguez, used his sewing kit to stitch together clothes to make a large sleeping bag, crucial for surviving the -30°C nights during the trek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

The journey was physically arduous, involving slipping and sliding up steep inclines, with every step forward often resulting in half a step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. After days of hiking, they realized their initial estimation was "grossly wrong," seeing only mountains in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. Vizintin returned to the crash site to conserve food, leaving Parrado and Canessa to continue alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

Parrado and Canessa hiked for nine days, covering 61 km on foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>. By the time they reached human presence, Canessa had lost half his body weight, weighing only 44 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>. Their incredible perseverance ultimately led to the rescue of 16 survivors, despite suffering from altitude sickness, dehydration, broken bones, and malnutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>. This event became known as "the Miracle of the Andes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:19:00">[27:19:00]</a>.

Visa agencies play a significant role in facilitating illegal immigration, particularly through methods like the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_india | 'donkey process']] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. These agencies often exploit the aspirations of individuals seeking better [[economic_motivation_behind_illegal_immigration | economic opportunities]] abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, particularly those from the lower middle class who lack the financial means or qualifications for legal immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Enticement and Advertising
In villages like Dingucha in Gujarat, located 13 km from Gandhinagar, numerous posters advertise opportunities to "Study in UK, Canada" with "Free Application" and "Offer Letter in 3 Days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The most advertised services in such villages are US or Canada visas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Many advertisements falsely guarantee visa acquisition without any exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Facilitating the 'Donkey Process'
Across India, a multitude of visa agencies and companies actively facilitate the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_india | 'donkey process']] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The agents involved in transporting individuals are often referred to as 'donkers' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
States like Gujarat and Punjab are known as primary exporters of illegal immigrants due to the prevalence of these agencies, with Haryana also entering this arena because of rising unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Service Packages and Costs
These agencies offer various "packages" to their clients:
*   **Deluxe Travel Package**: This includes forging fake documents and comprehensive travel assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Economical Packages**: For budget-conscious individuals, agencies might simply drop them near the border, requiring them to complete the journey on foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

The fees charged by these agencies can range from ₹2.5 million to ₹6 million, depending on the chosen package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. To afford these exorbitant sums, individuals often sell their farms, homes, or deplete their entire life savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Misleading Practices and Exploitation
Agencies frequently mislead people with false promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. They assure applicants of a smooth journey and abundant job opportunities in countries like America, while conveniently concealing the significant challenges and legal hurdles involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This exploitation is often due to an "information gap," where unsuspecting individuals are unaware of the inherent dangers and complexities of the illegal process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
Individuals who turn to these agencies either fail to realize that regular visa fees are not this high or are unable to obtain a regular visa due to failing to meet requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This leads them to believe they have no other alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Consequences of Deception
If caught lying about their reasons for asylum, individuals face deportation, rendering the millions they spent worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. Being caught in a lie can also result in a ban, prohibiting future legal travel to the destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### Dangers Facilitated by Agents
Agents operating the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_india | 'donkey process']] are directly implicated in the dangers faced by migrants. For instance, in the US-Mexico border crossing through the Darien Gap, if agents do not pay the 'donkers' in full, the 'donkers' may kill the travelers, leading to numerous deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The journey itself is fraught with [[risks_and_dangers_of_the_usmexico_border_crossing | risks and dangers]], including extreme weather and perilous terrain, which agents often fail to disclose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

In summary, visa agencies, despite their promises, are deeply involved in facilitating risky and illegal immigration paths, often leading to tragic outcomes for those who put their trust and life savings into their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

The distribution of money among different states in the recent budget has drawn significant criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

## Focus on Andhra Pradesh and Bihar

The government gave special attention to the states of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, allocating substantial funds compared to other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

### Andhra Pradesh
Andhra Pradesh received ₹150 billion for the development of its capital, Amravati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. This allocation comes after the state's elections have already concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

### Bihar
Bihar's budget allocation is notably high, particularly as elections in the state are yet to be held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   ₹600 billion will be spent on various infrastructure projects, including expressways, power plants, heritage corridors, and new airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   An additional ₹115 billion is allocated for flood mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   Bihar will also receive the largest share from the Tourism Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The Finance Minister stated that Vishnupad Mandir of Gaya and Mahabodhi Mandir in Bodh Gaya will be provided with world-class facilities and tourism infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Political Implications

The significant allocation of funds to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar is seen as an effort by the ruling BJP, in its minority government, to appease its allies, the TDP and JDU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

The Leader of Opposition, Rahul Gandhi, criticized this budget, terming it a "Seat Conservation Budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

Historically, the BJP government has been accused of favoring states like Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh while neglecting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. However, the current focus has shifted to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

A video addressing the [[the_kerala_story_film_controversy | controversy surrounding The Kerala Story]] film went viral, accumulating nearly 15 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The creator asserts that no one could find a single mistake in the 22-minute video because everything presented was based on facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The video aimed to counter the film's claims, which it argues were spreading hatred across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Debunking the 32,000 Conversion Figure

The central claim of *The Kerala Story* film revolved around a figure of 32,000 women from Kerala allegedly joining ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The video explicitly states this figure is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Instead, the video presented evidence from multiple sources to show the actual number of Indians who left India to join ISIS was around 60-65 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Of these:
*   22 individuals were from Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Among them, 6 were women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   3 of these women were Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   The remaining 3 were converts: 2 Christians and 1 Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

These facts are supported by data from various reputable sources:
*   Home Ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   National Investigation Agency (NIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   American Department of State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Observer Researcher Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Numerous news articles and reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

### Supreme Court Confirmation

On May 18th, the Supreme Court of India checked and confirmed these facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The Supreme Court stated that the situation depicted in the film is not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Consequently, the Court directed the film's producers to issue a disclaimer before the film is shown in cinemas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

> [!INFO] Required Disclaimer for *The Kerala Story*
> The disclaimer must state: "There is no authentic data to back up the suggestion that the figure of conversion is 32,000 or any other figure." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> It must also state: "This film represents a fictionalized version." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

## Rebuttals to Counter-Arguments

The video also addresses several counter-videos and arguments made against its claims.

### The Ad Hominem Fallacy

The video creator identifies a common [[fake_news_in_indian_media | logical fallacy]] used by critics: the Ad Hominem fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This involves criticizing the character of the person making an argument rather than the argument itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. An example given is the YouTuber Elvish Yadav, whose video was the most viewed counter-response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The video criticizes Elvish Yadav's content for its misogynistic and toxic portrayal of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, and for using Hinduism in a "disgusting way to get views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. However, the creator explicitly states this character criticism is an Ad Hominem fallacy and then proceeds to address Elvish Yadav's actual arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Misinterpretation of Data and Statements

1.  **Oommen Chandy's Statement**: Elvish Yadav cited former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy's report that 7,713 people converted between 2006 and 2012, presenting it as new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The video creator points out that this article and figure were already discussed in detail in his original video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. He further notes that Elvish Yadav is repeating false claims made by the film's director, Sudipto Sen, claims that the director himself later seemed "embarrassed" to repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
2.  **Pew Research Center Survey**: Elvish Yadav questioned the methodology of the Pew Research Center survey, which interviewed 30,000 people in 17 languages in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Elvish's skepticism regarding sample size (e.g., claiming a local survey of 10 people about Modi would show 90% support) demonstrated a lack of understanding of statistics, random sampling, and representative sampling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
3.  **The Word "Only"**: Critics twisted the video creator's use of "only 3 women" to imply indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. The creator clarifies that the word "only" was used in comparison to the exaggerated figure of 32,000, not to diminish the seriousness of each individual case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. He affirmed that "even 1 is too many" and that making a movie about these 3 women is not wrong, but lying about it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
4.  **Oommen Chandy and ISIS Timeline**: A critic argued that the Oommen Chandy article (2006-2012) couldn't mention ISIS because ISIS was active only after 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. The video creator points out that he never claimed the girls joined ISIS during that specific 2006-2012 period, thus the criticism is irrelevant to his argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

### The Strawman Fallacy

Another [[fake_news_in_indian_media | logical fallacy]] employed by critics is the Strawman fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. This involves misrepresenting an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. For example, some critics created a strawman argument that because the video creator didn't extensively discuss PFI (Popular Front of India), he must support Muslim extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. The creator refutes this by listing his past videos criticizing extremism across various religions and regions, including the Taliban, Hamas, Iranian protests, Muslim extremism in Pakistan, and Khalistani extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

### "Absence of Evidence is Not Evidence of Absence"

Critics argued that a lack of evidence doesn't mean something isn't happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. While agreeing with the philosophical truth of this statement, the creator argues that in the case of *The Kerala Story*, there is abundant evidence (NIA, Home Ministry, US Department of State, news articles, external NGO data) directly refuting the film's specific claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. He concludes that using this argument to justify believing a conspiracy theory, despite overwhelming counter-evidence, is illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

### "Right to Comment" Argument

A critic claimed that the video creator, being from Haryana (low Muslim population) and living in Germany (low Muslim population), does not have the right to comment on India's Hindu-Muslim problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. The creator dismissed this as absurd, questioning the logic that one can only comment on an issue if they have direct personal experience, effectively negating the purpose of journalism, research, and surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

## Cinematic Liberty vs. Lying

The video highlights the distinction between artistic license and spreading misinformation. While some argued that [[reallife_events_depicted_in_jawan_film | fictionalizing things]] in movies is "cinematic liberty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, the creator asserts that this doesn't apply to *The Kerala Story*. The film's producers, director, and actress explicitly claimed in interviews and on social media that the 32,000 figure was a true story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. The video labels this as "lying," not cinematic liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

### Impact of *The Kerala Story* vs. *Border*

The creator contrasts *The Kerala Story* with the film *Border*, which he describes as a brilliant film promoting patriotism and humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. *Border* portrays soldiers' sacrifices and a message of peace and mutual prosperity between nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. The creator argues that if *Border* were released today, "illiterate people" would boycott it for promoting development in both countries, a message those "who feed on hatred" cannot tolerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

In contrast, *The Kerala Story* elicits reactions of hatred, with viewers coming out of cinema halls insulting all Muslims, creating an "us versus them" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. The video concludes that *The Kerala Story* is "vulgar, hateful propaganda" that exaggerates facts and defames an entire state and community based on a few cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

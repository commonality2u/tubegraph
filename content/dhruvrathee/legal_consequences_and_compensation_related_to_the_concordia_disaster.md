## Overview of the Disaster's Aftermath
The [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster]], which occurred on January 13, 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, resulted in the loss of 32 lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a> and led to extensive legal cases and financial repercussions. The immense scale of the incident, involving a ship larger than the [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | Titanic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> and carrying 4,252 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, demanded significant salvage efforts and compensation.

## Financial Impact and Compensation
The Costa Crociere company, which operated the Costa Concordia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, faced substantial costs and legal obligations following the disaster.

### Salvage and Cleanup Costs
*   The ship was declared a constructive total loss, meaning it could not be saved or reused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The only option was to disassemble it and sell its scrap metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   Initially, 1.9 million litres of fuel had to be removed from the fully loaded ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This process began on February 12, 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>, and lasted over a month until March 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   The [[engineering_challenges_and_costs_of_salvaging_the_costa_concordia | engineering project]] to set the ship upright and relocate it began in April 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This complex operation involved building a steel structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, attaching 15 watertight boxes called caissons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, and took 19 hours to straighten the ship on September 16, 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   The cost of rescuing the ship alone reached $799 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   By July 2014, when the ship was towed to port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, the total cost of the operation had reached $1.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
*   Scrapping the broken ship, which involved over 350 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>, was completed in July 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

### Passenger Compensation
*   The company returned the price of each surviving passenger's ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   An additional €11,000 (approximately ₹1 million) was paid as compensation to each surviving passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   The families of the deceased passengers received an undisclosed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.
*   The total cost of the disaster for Costa Crociere amounted to $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

## Legal Proceedings Against Captain Francesco Schettino
Captain Francesco Schettino, the captain of the Costa Concordia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, became the central figure in the legal investigations. He was widely criticized for his actions before, during, and after the collision.

*   Schettino deliberately deviated from the normal route to perform a "sail past" near Giglio Island to impress locals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This brought the ship dangerously close to shore (150m instead of 7-8km) where the water was not deep enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport confirmed the unsafe distance and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   After the collision, Schettino initially hid the severity of the situation from passengers, falsely announcing an electrical failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, despite the engine having failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. He continued to deny the seriousness of the incident to the Italian coast guard, claiming it was just a blackout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   It took over an hour for Captain Schettino to finally give the order to abandon ship at 10:59 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, despite the ship tilting significantly and water entering lower rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Controversially, Schettino was among the first crew members to abandon the ship at 11:19 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, leaving passengers and crew behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   During the trial, Schettino famously claimed that he "slipped and fell into a lifeboat" due to the ship's angle, leading to his accidental departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. This argument was not believed by the judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   In 2017, Captain Schettino was charged with manslaughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a> and sentenced to 16 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. He is currently serving his sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   His former senior captain, Mario Palombo, revealed that Schettino had a long history of lying and preferred to conceal his mistakes rather than admit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

## Convictions of Other Officers
Along with Captain Schettino, five other high-ranking officers on the ship were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. Each of them was sentenced to two years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Heroic Actions Amidst Chaos
> While Schettino abandoned the ship, other crew members and civilians showed immense bravery. Indian waiter Russell Rebello helped passengers onto lifeboats until the last moment, eventually drowning while helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Roberto Bosio, another ship captain who was a passenger that night, also stayed and helped evacuate people before Schettino's official announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. The deputy mayor of Giglio Island, Mario Pellegrini, a civilian, also went to the sinking ship to rescue trapped people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

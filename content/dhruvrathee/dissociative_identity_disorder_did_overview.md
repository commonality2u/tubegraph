## The Case of Anneliese Michel
In 2005, the popular Hollywood film *The Exorcism of Emily Rose* was released, claiming to be "Based on a true story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This film was based on the true incident of [[anneliese_michels_exorcism_and_mental_health | Anneliese Michel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, one of the most famous exorcism incidents globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

Anneliese Michel, born in West Germany in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, experienced unusual symptoms starting at age 16 when she fainted in school and entered a trance-like state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Later, she awoke feeling a heavy weight on her body and having wet the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Despite initial doctor visits, including a neurologist, nothing medically wrong was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

In February 1970, Anneliese was hospitalized for tuberculosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. While there, she reported seeing strange colors and hearing voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Doctors diagnosed her with temporal lobe epilepsy, a condition affecting over 50 million people worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. However, her case progressed uniquely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. She developed dangerous hallucinations, hearing voices that claimed she was cursed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, leading to depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

Her behavior escalated, including kneeling 600 times a day, damaging her knee ligaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, barking like a dog for two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, and consuming spiders, coal, and birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Unable to get medical answers, her parents sought an exorcism, a religious procedure to remove evil spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. It was believed that six demons resided within her, including Adolf Hitler, Emperor Nero, Judas, Cain, Lucifer, and Valentin Fleischmann (a disgraced 16th-century priest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. During exorcism sessions, the "demons" reportedly spoke through her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>, with audio clips still available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

Anneliese Michel underwent 67 exorcisms in 10 months, after which she passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Her death, which became a national scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>, was attributed to starvation and acute dehydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>, leaving her weighing only 32 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

## Scientific Explanation: Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)
From a [[science_behind_demonic_possession | scientific perspective]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, alleged cases of "demonic possession" or "ghost taking control of your body" are understood as a mental condition now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. Formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, DID involves a person having multiple distinct personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

### Psychological Basis of Identity
To understand DID, it's crucial to grasp the complexity of identity. Poet Nida Fazli suggested that every person contains "10-20 men inside him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, reflecting a deeper [[psychological_theories_and_identity | psychological meaning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. In [[psychological_theories_and_identity | psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>, our self-concept, as defined by psychologist Carl Rogers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, is composed of three parts:
1.  **Actual Self**: The person you are in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Self-Image**: The person you *think* you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. This can be distorted; for example, the Dunning-Kruger effect describes how a person may overestimate their abilities despite a lack of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Ideal Self**: The person you *want* to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. This is influenced by personal desires and social conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

The alignment between self-image and ideal self impacts self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. A large difference leads to low self-esteem, while similarity fosters high confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. Our identity is complex, influenced by habits, environment, pride, embarrassment, regrets, secrets, fears, desires, and fantasies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. It's possible to appear happy externally but feel sad internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>, or to have a biological gender that doesn't align with one's felt identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

### Alters and Host Identity
In DID, these multiple identities can "dissociate" into distinct personalities, known as "Alters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. A person can have two, four, five, or even twenty alters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. A famous case is Kim Noble, who has over 100 different personalities, each with a different name, age, gender identity, temperament, body language, and distinct memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

While many people exhibit different behaviors depending on who they are with (e.g., friends vs. parents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, in DID, this habit reaches an extreme level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. Not only behavior and body language change, but also name, age, and memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Minds become divided into compartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

There is a main personality, called the Host Identity or Primary Identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>, which is typically the person's birth name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. However, an alter can also become the host identity, as seen with Kim Noble, whose alter Patricia became her primary host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. When a personality switch occurs, memory of the other personality's actions often disappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. This can lead to frequent memory losses, missing keys, forgotten orders, or finding one's car miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. In a disturbing incident, Kim's 15-year-old alter, Julie, took over while driving, leading to an accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

Individuals with DID often do not realize they have the disorder, only noticing frequent memory losses or a poor sense of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. Acceptance of the diagnosis can take years of therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

### Root Cause and Treatment
The root cause of DID, in approximately 90% of documented cases in the US, Canada, and Europe, is childhood abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. This trauma causes the brain to dissociate as a coping mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>, splitting into different personalities to overcome the mental wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

DID is a serious mental illness that can lead to stress, anxiety, severe depression, substance addiction, and in some cases, self-harm or violence towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. Traumatic childhood events often remain in the unconscious mind, and victims may not even remember what happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.

Treatment for DID involves psychotherapy, where the therapist helps the patient recall the traumatic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. The solution is "Reintegration," establishing communication between alters so identities can reunite into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. Acceptance and forgiveness of the traumatic event are crucial for reintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. By understanding triggers, patients can learn to manage their DID system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

### Spectrum of Dissociation
Dissociation exists on a spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>. While DID represents extreme cases, mild forms are common. Studies suggest 50-74% of people have experienced at least one dissociative episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.

Mild cases include:
*   **Dissociative Amnesia**: Forgetting details of a traumatic episode as the mind dissociates it from time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.
*   **Dissociative Fugue**: Confusion about past events, leading to a loss of personal identity and memory, and sometimes unexpected travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>. An example is Michael Boatwright, an American man who started speaking Swedish after fainting due to having lived in Sweden for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. He had no memory of his son or ex-wives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>.
*   **Depersonalization**: Feeling detached from one's own actions, thoughts, or feelings, viewing oneself as an outsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.
*   **Derealization**: Feeling that the world and people around them are unreal, like a dream, with time moving strangely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

### [[media_portrayal_of_mental_illnesses | Media portrayal of mental illnesses]]
Unfortunately, most films depict these mental health issues in a scary or insensitive way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>. For example, *Bhool Bhulaiya* uses a character's mental illness for comic relief and shows unrealistic "treatments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>. Films like *Aparichit* or *Psycho* sensationalize DID patients as violent and dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>, adding to the societal stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>. In reality, most DID patients are not violent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.

Some films, however, portray DID sensitively, such as *Karthik Calling Karthik* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a> and the Haryanvi web series *Opri Paraai*, which accurately depicts psychotherapeutic rules like creating an environment of safety, confidentiality, and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
It is crucial to destigmatize mental illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:00]</a>. Just as one seeks a cardiologist for heart problems, a psychotherapist should be consulted for mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>. Stress, anxiety, depression, or irritability can stem from underlying mental illnesses, making professional consultation important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>. The idea of ghosts, demons, or witches causing such conditions belongs to an outdated worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>.

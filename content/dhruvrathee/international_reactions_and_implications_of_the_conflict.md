The conflict that began with Hamas's attack last year has expanded to involve multiple countries and paramilitary groups, leading to widespread international concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This has prompted discussions about the conflict's potential to escalate into a regional war in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Iran's Direct Involvement

On October 1st, Israel's sky was illuminated by over 180 ballistic missiles sent by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The order for this launch came directly from Iran's Head of State and Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While Iran's IRGC claimed over 90% of missiles hit their targets, Israel stated that most were intercepted by its air defense system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Damage was observed, including a 30-foot deep crater near Mossad's headquarters and hits on a large Israeli military base in the Negev desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Despite minimal damage claims, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed retaliation, stating Iran "will pay for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

This was not Iran's first attack on Israel this year; on April 13th, over 300 drones and missiles were launched, an attack larger in scale of machinery deployed than the October one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. This April attack was the first time in decades another country had attacked Israel, with the previous instance being Saddam Hussein's Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Iran justified the April attack as retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on Syria's capital, Damascus, around April 1st, which killed seven Iranian officers, including a top general from the Iranian embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Israel countered that the target was a military building, not an embassy, and the deceased officer had links to Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

After the October attacks, Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani described the strikes as a limited act of self-defense, suggesting Western countries should praise them for not escalating further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

## International Assistance and Alliances

During the April attack, Israel received aid from allied countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The US intercepted approximately 80 drones and 6 ballistic missiles, while British Royal Air Force Typhoon jets took down several drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Israel's F-35 stealth fighter jets countered 25 out of 30 cruise missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### The "Axis of Resistance"

Groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis have been attacking Israel for years, with increased frequency since Israel's retaliation in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. These three groups—Hamas in Gaza, Houthis in Yemen, and Hezbollah in South Lebanon—are considered Iranian proxies, known as the "Axis of Resistance," funded and supported by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

Hezbollah, a Shia militant group, gained power after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and officially formed in 1985 with a manifesto to eradicate Western powers from Lebanon and destroy the Israeli state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. Most Western countries, including the US and European nations, classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, though the Indian government does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. Hezbollah pushed Israel out of Lebanon in 2000 after 22 years of occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Since October 8th, 2023, Hezbollah has officially declared a state of war against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

The Houthis, founded in the 1990s due to Shia marginalization and increasing foreign influence in Yemen, are also considered a terrorist organization by many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. The Indian government, however, does not consider them a terrorist organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. Besides Iran, Russia is also said to fund the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. Saudi Arabia and Western countries support the Yemeni government against the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

### Broader Geopolitical Alignments

The Middle East features Saudi Arabia and Iran as two superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. These countries support either neighboring governments or rebel groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. For example, in Yemen, Saudi Arabia supports the government, while Iran favors rebels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. A similar dynamic exists in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. Internationally, Western countries, including the US and EU, mostly favor Saudi Arabia, while Russia and China tend to favor Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. Saudi Arabia, a Sunni-dominated country, often opposes Iran, which is Shia-dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

## Economic and Humanitarian Impacts

The Houthi attacks have disrupted the Red Sea, impacting passing ships with missiles and leading to trade losses of nearly $1 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>.

Between October 7th, 2023, and September 22nd, 2024, 41,431 Palestinians have been killed, with over half being children and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. More than 2 million people have been displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. In the Israeli-Lebanese border region, over 80,000 Israelis have had to evacuate their homes due to daily rocket fires from Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. In the last week of September alone, around 1,000 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>.

## Diplomatic Reactions and Calls for De-escalation

After the April attack, the United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting where the Secretary-General urged both sides to diffuse and de-escalate the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. The UN and USA have continuously condemned the ongoing attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>.

India has also reacted to the conflict, expressing deep concern about the escalating security situation in West Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>. The Indian government has urged that all issues be addressed through dialogue and diplomacy and has advised its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>. India's Foreign Minister Jai Shankar stated that while India understands Israel's need to respond, any response must adhere to international humanitarian laws, ensuring no damage to civilian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.

The UN Secretary-General António Guterres has condemned the overall conflict without blaming a specific country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>. The continuous cycle of retaliation primarily harms innocent civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. Mahatma Gandhi's statement, "An eye for an eye ends up making the whole world blind," is cited as a fitting perspective on the tit-for-tat approaches of governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. To prevent further escalation, a path of peace is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. Some attribute these conflicts to the "Weapons Mafia," who profit from international arms sales during wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

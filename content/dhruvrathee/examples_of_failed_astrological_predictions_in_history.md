Astrology, often presented as a guide to future events, has a long history of making predictions that fail to materialize. These inaccuracies highlight a lack of scientific basis and logical consistency in its claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Failed Sports Predictions

A notable instance of failed astrological prognostication involved the Indian cricket team's performance in the T20 World Cup. After losing the semi-final match against England, the team was eliminated from the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Prior to this match, a news program on ABP, titled "11 Astrologers Will Predict Our World Cup Win," featured multiple astrologers making bold assertions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Predictions included:
*   "I can 100% guarantee that India will win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   "If we look at India's charts, tomorrow's victory is certain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Many also predicted a "neck-to-neck battle" and a "close match" with a "100% guarantee of a victory" for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

However, the actual match was completely one-sided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. India scored 168 runs, and England chased the target in 16 overs without losing any wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Guinness World Record even humorously questioned if it was the easiest run chase in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Despite these specific and definitive predictions, the outcome was the complete opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Failed Pandemic Predictions

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several astrologers made specific predictions that proved false.
*   India's well-known astrologer, Bejan Daruwalla, predicted in 2020 that after May 15, 2020, Covid-19 would be "completely eradicated" or "slow down to a large extent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Other astrologers claimed the peak had already passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   Some linked planetary movements, stating that after March 30 (when Jupiter would leave Ketu), the influence of the Coronavirus would steadily reduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Another prediction suggested the problem would last only until September 19, when Rahu was expected to enter Taurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

All these predictions regarding the pandemic's timeline and eradication proved to be incorrect as the pandemic continued well beyond these dates.

## Failed Doomsday Predictions

History is replete with examples of individuals making predictions about the end of the world, all of which have failed:
*   In 1499, German mathematician and astrologer Johannes St√∂ffler predicted the world would end on February 20, 1524, following a massive flood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This event did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Christian numerologist David Meade claimed that on September 23, 2017, the world would end due to a collision with a hidden planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This prediction also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   American preacher Harold Camping asserted that the world would end on May 21, 2011, a message he advertised on 5,000 billboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. When this did not happen, he postponed the date to October, and after that failed, he ceased making predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   Around 2009-2010, significant news circulated about the Mayan calendar, which spanned 5,125 years, ending on December 21, 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Many believed this meant the world would end on that day. A Reuters opinion poll across 20 countries found that 1 in 7 people believed the world would end in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This prediction, like the others, was false.

These repeated failures of astrological predictions underscore a fundamental lack of accuracy and reliability, contrasting sharply with the notion of a predetermined destiny or the ability of astrologers to influence or foresee future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The phenomenon of people continuing to believe in these predictions despite overwhelming evidence against them is often attributed to psychological factors like [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology|the Barnum Effect]] and other [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people|deceptive techniques]] used by practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

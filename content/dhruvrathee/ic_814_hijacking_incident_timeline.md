On December 24, 1999, Indian Airlines flight IC 814, bound for Delhi, took off from Kathmandu, Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The flight, carrying 11 crew members and 179 passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, was hijacked by five individuals shortly after takeoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This incident became the biggest and, fortunately, the last plane hijacking in Indian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The ordeal lasted for seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Initial Hijacking and Diversion

After food was served on the flight, four masked men stood up and announced the plane had been hijacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. They entered the pilot's cabin and, holding Capt Devi Sharan at gunpoint, ordered him to fly westwards towards Pakistan, specifically Lahore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Timeline of Key Events: Day 1 (December 24, 1999)

*   **04:40 PM (IST)**: Indian Air Traffic Control (ATC) learned of the hijacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **05:20 PM (IST)**: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra were informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **06:04 PM (IST)**: Indian ATC established communication with IC 814 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Capt Devi Sharan reported low fuel and that Lahore denied landing permission, requesting Indian ATC to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **06:30 PM (IST)**: The Indian High Commission in Pakistan requested Lahore to allow the plane to land, but permission was still denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   Capt Devi Sharan convinced the hijackers to land in Amritsar for refueling due to critical fuel levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## Amritsar Landing and Blunders

The plane began descending towards Amritsar at 6:44 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, landing at Amritsar airport at 7:01 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This landing presented a crucial opportunity for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

However, a series of missteps by the Indian authorities occurred:
*   Punjab's Director General of Police, Sarabjit Singh, was informed about the hijacking through TV news, not official channels, around 6 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   A crisis management group was formed with the intent to delay the plane to allow commandos to strategize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   Hijackers refused to communicate with local police, demanding to speak with Delhi officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   Refueling was delayed despite Capt Sharan's urgent requests, leading to the hijackers injuring passenger Satnam Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   A plan to puncture the plane's tires using a fuel tanker was devised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Another plan was to block the plane with a fuel tanker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   Due to miscommunication, the fuel tanker driver suddenly stopped the vehicle, tipping off the hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
*   Frustrated, the hijackers forced the captain to take off without refueling, narrowly avoiding the tanker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

The plane took off from Amritsar at exactly 7:49 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>, precisely when NSG commandos arrived at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>, rendering their efforts useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Upon takeoff, Capt Devi Sharan radioed ATC, stating, "We are all dying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

## Journey to Lahore and Dubai

The flight again turned towards Pakistan, only 50 km from Amritsar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Lahore ATC again denied permission to land and turned off all airport lights and navigational aids to prevent an emergency landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Faced with a potential crash landing on a highway, Capt Sharan made a final plea, and Lahore ATC finally agreed to allow landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. The plane landed in Lahore at 8:07 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

*   India urged Pakistan to prevent the plane's takeoff, planning to send High Commissioner G Parthasarathy for negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   The plane was refueled, and Pakistani commandos surrounded it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. They attempted to negotiate for the release of women and children, but failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
*   Frustrated, the hijackers attacked another passenger, Rupin Katyal, who later died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   Despite efforts to keep the plane grounded, it took off again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. The Indian High Commissioner arrived three hours late, finding the plane already gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

The flight was then directed to Oman, where landing was rejected, before heading to Dubai's Al Minhad Air Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Around 3:00 AM, after negotiations, the hijackers released 26 passengers in Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. A special relief aircraft took these passengers back to India, accompanied by Civil Aviation Minister Sharad Yadav <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

Returning passengers revealed that men were segregated from women and children and blindfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. They identified five hijackers by their code names: Chief (leader), Burger, Doctor, Shankar, and Bhola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. Most hijackers were later identified as being from Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. Conditions on the plane deteriorated with low food/water and overflowing toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

## Kandahar Landing and Negotiations

On December 26, the plane landed at Kandahar International Airport in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. The Taliban, then in power in Afghanistan, offered to mediate between the hijackers and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. India did not recognize the Taliban government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>, but sent an Indian High Commissioner from Islamabad to Kandahar to negotiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. The plane and its passengers remained trapped in Kandahar for six days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.

India suspected Taliban's intentions, as the plane was surrounded by armed Taliban members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. While the Taliban claimed this was to control the hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>, Indian analysts believed it was to prevent military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.

Ajit Doval, part of the negotiation team, claimed the hijackers received support from active ISI elements in Kandahar, guaranteeing a safe exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

### Hijackers' Demands and Government Pressure

The hijackers demanded $200 million (â‚¹16.5 billion), the release of 36 prisoners, and the dead body of Sajjad Afghani, founder of Harkat-Ul-Mujahideen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.

The Indian government faced immense public pressure:
*   On December 26, family members of the passengers disrupted a press conference by External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh, demanding the government fulfill the hijackers' demands to save their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. They cited the 1989 incident where Union Minister Mufti Mohammad Saeed's daughter was freed after militants were released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.
*   On December 27, relatives gatecrashed a Crisis Management Group meeting, and protests occurred outside the Prime Minister's residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.

The Indian negotiation team, led by Vivek Katju and including Ajit Doval, reached Kandahar on December 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. The [[Role of Taliban in IC 814 hijacking negotiations | Taliban]] refused to allow Indian forces to conduct rescue operations but offered to mediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>.

Through negotiations, the hijackers' demands were reduced significantly, from 36 prisoners to only 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. The credit for this reduction was given to both Indian negotiators and the [[Role of Taliban in IC 814 hijacking negotiations | Taliban]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.

By December 30, RAW Chief A. S. Dulat reached Jammu to convince Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah to release two prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. Despite initial reluctance, Abdullah succumbed to pressure and agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>. The prisoners were transported to Delhi and then to Kandahar with External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

## Hostage Release and Aftermath

On December 31, the hijackers' demands were met, and three prisoners were released in Kandahar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>. Simultaneously, the hijackers released the plane's passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. India had expected the Taliban to arrest the hijackers, but they did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. Instead, the Taliban's supreme leader and another member drove the hijackers and the released terrorists to the Pakistan border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>. This confirmed [[India Pakistan involvement in IC 814 hijacking | Pakistan's involvement]] in the hijacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

The hijackers safely crossed into Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. The passengers, many injured and starving, finally returned home on December 31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

The hijacked plane was retired in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. Blame for the incident was placed on the hijackers and their supporters, including the [[Role of Taliban in IC 814 hijacking negotiations | Taliban]] and Pakistani forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.

### Criticism of Government Handling

The [[Indian governments handling of IC 814 hijacking | incumbent Indian government]] faced significant criticism for its handling of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>. The opportunity to regain control of the plane in Amritsar was lost due to "big blunders" and a "communication gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. It was revealed that one passenger, Shashi Bhushan Singh Tomar, was the brother-in-law of Prime Minister Vajpayee's Secretary, N K Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. A theory emerged that the plane was allowed to leave Amritsar to ensure Tomar's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>.

Many top leaders, including then Home Minister LK Advani, learned about the hijacking through TV news rather than official channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>.

### Lasting [[Impact of IC 814 hijacking on Indian aviation security | Impact]]

Despite the failures, the IC 814 hijacking led to a significant positive outcome: since then, India has not experienced another plane hijacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. Regulations and processes for aviation security have been made extremely strict, making hijackings exceedingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>.

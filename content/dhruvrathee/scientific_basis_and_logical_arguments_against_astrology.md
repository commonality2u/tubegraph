Astrology is widely regarded as a [[critique_of_astrology_as_a_fraud_industry | fraud industry]] that has deceived millions of people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Despite its pervasive influence, especially in countries like India, astrological predictions lack any scientific basis and are fraught with logical inconsistencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This article examines the scientific and logical arguments against astrology, as well as the psychological phenomena and deceptive techniques that contribute to its widespread belief.

## Lack of Scientific Foundation

According to Nobel laureate in Chemistry, Dr. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, the movement of stars and planets has no effect on human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This view is widely supported by scientists worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Gravitational Force Misconception
Astrology often implies that celestial bodies influence human fate, but the primary force exerted by the Sun and other planets on Earth is gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Gravitational force depends only on the mass and distance between two objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. It is illogical to assume that this force could dictate whether someone gets a dream job or college admission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The idea that the Sun or Mars would discriminate based on birth date, exerting different gravitational forces on individuals, makes no sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Logical Inconsistencies and Failed Predictions

History is replete with [[examples_of_failed_astrological_predictions_in_history | examples of failed astrological predictions]].

### Sport Predictions
Prior to the T20 World Cup semi-final match between India and England, 11 astrologers on an ABP news program predicted India would win and that it would be a close, neck-to-neck battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. However, the match was one-sided, with England chasing India's 168 runs in 16 overs without losing any wickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Health and World End Predictions
*   India's renowned astrologer Bejan Daruwalla predicted that Covid-19 would be eradicated or significantly slow down after May 15, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Other astrologers made similar false predictions about the pandemic peaking or ending by specific dates in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   In 1499, German astrologer Johannes St√∂ffler predicted the world would end on February 20, 1524, due to a great flood, which did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
*   Christian numerologist David Meade predicted the world's end on September 23, 2017, due to a hidden planet collision, which also did not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   American preacher Harold Camping claimed the world would end on May 21, 2011. When it did not, he postponed the date to October, and then remained silent after that prediction also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   A 2009-2010 belief based on the Mayan calendar's end date of December 21, 2012, led 1 in 7 people across 20 countries to believe the world would end, as per a Reuters poll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

### Horoscope Discrepancies
Astrology categorizes people into sun signs based on birth month. However, this leads to logical inconsistencies:
*   Individuals born nearly a month apart (e.g., January 20th and February 18th, both Aquarius) are said to have the same horoscope, while those born just a day apart (e.g., February 18th and February 19th, Pisces) have vastly different horoscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   If astrology relates to precise birth times, then twins born minutes apart should have similar lives, yet this is not observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. A 1958 London study of over 2,000 children born at the same time showed no similarities in over 100 different characteristics, including job choice, marital status, personality, and IQ level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
*   In tragedies like bridge collapses, earthquakes, or floods, hundreds of people die together, yet they are not born at the same time, nor do they share the same horoscopes or astrological signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

### Impractical Solutions
Astrologers often suggest absurd "solutions" to change one's destiny:
*   Nirmal Baba claimed eating green chutney with samosas would bring good luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   Adding or removing letters from names (e.g., adding an 'R' to Ayushman Khurana's name, or adding an 'S' to Tusshar Kapoor's name) is claimed to bring better luck or success, despite success depending on skills and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
*   Matching birth charts for marriage and selecting auspicious wedding times, despite divorces still occurring and successful marriages existing in cultures without such customs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

### Financial Contradiction
If astrologers could truly predict the future, they would use their knowledge to win lotteries or invest in the stock market to become billionaires, rather than asking for money from people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

## Why People Believe: Psychological Phenomena

Millions continue to believe in astrology due to several psychological factors:

### Weak Minds and Uncertainty
People are often bothered by the uncertainty of the future and seek certainty, security, and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. Astrology provides a false sense of certainty and positive predictions can fill people with happiness and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Swami Vivekananda stated that such beliefs are a sign of a weak mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. Individuals who wish to believe in astrology are less likely to question or doubt astrologers' claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

### [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology | Cold Reading]]
Astrologers use [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology | cold reading]] by making generalized statements that can apply to almost anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.
*   Statements like "Your fate will take a turn for the better when you turn 30" can refer to a new job, marriage, a baby, or even surviving an accident, leading individuals to interpret it positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   Similarly, "An incident happened in your childhood that has left a lasting impact on your life" applies to nearly everyone, encompassing events like the death of a pet, a family member, or experiences of abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[00:14:39]</a>.

### [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology | Barnum Effect]] (Forer Effect)
The [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology | Barnum Effect]], also known as the Forer Effect, describes the tendency for individuals to accept vague, generalized personality descriptions as highly accurate and specific to themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.
*   In a 1948 experiment, psychologist Bertram R. Forer gave 39 students a personality test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. Each student received the *exact same* "personality sketch" containing 13 general qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. The students were asked to rate the accuracy of these qualities on a scale of 0 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. The average accuracy score was 4.26 out of 5, with most students believing the description accurately depicted their unique personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
*   This happens because people prefer hearing positive or sympathetic things about themselves and like to believe they are special and unique, even though people are often not as unique as they think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.
*   Examples of such statements include: "You have so much capacity you have not tapped into yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>, "You need some variety in your life, that's why you do not like anyone restricting you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>, or "You've seen that revealing everything about yourself to someone is not good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. Sympathetic statements like "You are very kind-hearted... people take advantage of you... they think of you as an emotional fool" also resonate deeply with individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.

## [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | Techniques Used by Astrologers]]

Beyond psychological manipulation, astrologers employ direct deceptive [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | techniques]]:

### [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | Picking Up Clues]]
Astrologers are often highly observant, similar to mentalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>. They gather information about individuals from their appearance, dressing style (formal vs. casual, designer brands), physical fitness, language use (plain Hindi, regional mix, English words), and demeanor (confident vs. vulnerable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. These observations allow them to accurately guess details about a person's food choices, hobbies, job, economic status, and education level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>.
*   Former astrologer Felicity Carter revealed that she heard the same stories repeatedly (romance, work, life changes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>. With experience, she could tell a person's problem from their appearance, for instance, advising a heartbroken young person to "Let her go. She's not worth it," purely based on observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.

### [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | Direct Fraud]]
Many astrologers in India resort to outright fraud by obtaining information about clients through secret channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>. Shyam Manav, founder of the Akhil Bharatiya Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (an organization debunking [[criticism_of_superstitions_and_black_magic | superstitions]]), demonstrated this by visiting a famous astrologer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. He intentionally gave false information (English professor from Nagpur University) to his rickshaw driver, who was secretly relaying information to the astrologer's receptionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>. The astrologer later called out for the "English Professor from Nagpur University," proving the information had been obtained fraudulently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>.

> Many YouTubers and influencers capitalize on the public's belief in astrology and paranormal phenomena (like ghosts and demons) by creating content that spins tales rather than revealing the truth, exploiting the existing gullibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>.

Ultimately, one's future is largely in their own hands, and while external circumstances cannot always be controlled, individuals control a significant portion of their own destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>.

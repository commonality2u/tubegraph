The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has released unprecedented images to the public, offering new insights into the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These images provide glimpses into the universe's past, including the oldest view from 13.1 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, and have led to the discovery of water on an exoplanet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## James Webb Space Telescope Overview

The JWST is described as the largest and most powerful space science telescope ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Its development and design took [[Spacecraft Technology and Discoveries | NASA]] 25 years and cost approximately $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

The telescope operates at an extremely low temperature of -266.75°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, which is only a few degrees warmer than absolute zero (-273°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. To maintain this temperature, it orbits the Sun, not Earth, staying within Earth's shadow at the L2 Point, located about 1.5 million km from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. A sun shield, nearly the size of a tennis court, protects it from sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

The JWST's focal length is 131.4 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, which is over 2,500 times greater than that of a typical DSLR camera lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Its main mirror weighs around 705 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Infrared Capabilities

The JWST primarily operates in the [[Infrared imaging and spectrography | infrared]] portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, with a wavelength range of 0.6 to 28 micrometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This allows it to see through gases and clouds due to the longer wavelength of [[Infrared imaging and spectrography | infrared]] light, similar to how radio waves can pass through walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

The telescope is equipped with two [[Infrared imaging and spectrography | infrared]] cameras:
*   **Near Infrared Camera (NIRCAM)**: Captures shorter [[Infrared imaging and spectrography | infrared]] wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI Cam)**: Captures longer [[Infrared imaging and spectrography | infrared]] wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

It also has a **Near Infra-Red Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS)**, an instrument that measures the intensity of various light wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

## Key Discoveries and Images

### The Death of a Star

One striking image from the JWST depicts the death of a star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. The photo shows two stars orbiting each other: one is in its early stages, and the other is dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Over thousands of years, the dying star has released clouds of gases and dust, forming what is known as a Planetary Nebula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. The gravitational pull of the two orbiting stars gives the cloud its unique swirled shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

Comparing images from NIRCAM and MIRI Cam reveals different perspectives:
*   NIRCAM shows only one star clearly and the surrounding cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   MIRI Cam, due to its longer wavelength capabilities, mutes the cloud but clearly shows both stars within the dense center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

Stars, like humans, have a life cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Our Sun, currently young, will become a Red Giant in about 5 billion years, expanding to swallow Venus and Mercury, making Earth uninhabitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. It will then pass through stages similar to the dying star, becoming a planetary nebula and eventually a White Dwarf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

### Glimpse into the Early Universe: SMACS 0723

The first photo released by [[Spacecraft Technology and Discoveries | NASA]] is considered historic, providing a glimpse from 13 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. U.S. President Joe Biden referred to it as a "new window into the history of our universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

This image, known as SMACS 0723, displays a galaxy cluster where closer galaxies exert a high gravitational force, distorting light from objects behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. This phenomenon, called Gravitational Lensing, acts like a magnifying glass, enabling observation of distant objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. The photo took 12.5 hours to create, as the telescope combined several images taken at different wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Galaxies appearing redder in the image are farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

### Interacting Galaxies: Stephan's Quintet

Stephan's Quintet is a cluster of five galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. While named a quintet, it's more of a quadtet because one galaxy is significantly closer (40 million light-years away) than the other four (about 290 million light-years away) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. The four more distant galaxies are so close to each other that their dust and stars interact, showing the effects of their mutual gravitational forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. Scientists find this interaction immensely interesting for understanding galactic evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### The Birth of a Star: Carina Nebula

The JWST has also captured images showing the birth of stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. The distinctive "Cosmic Cliffs" seen in these images are part of the Carina Nebula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. A nebula is a bright area formed by clouds of dust and gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. In the life cycle of a star, birth occurs at the Stellar Nebula stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. The red dots within the Carina Nebula image represent growing infant stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

### Exoplanet WASP-96B and the Discovery of Water

One of the most intriguing findings is not an image but spectrographic data of the exoplanet WASP-96B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. This exoplanet, located 1,150 light-years away, is outside our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. The NIRISS instrument on the JWST measured light from WASP-96B for 6.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, producing a light curve that indicates the presence of water (H2O), haze, and clouds on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

The determination of water presence without a direct image is based on spectrography. Different molecules absorb and block specific wavelengths of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. For example, chlorophyll in leaves absorbs red and blue wavelengths, reflecting green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>, and water absorbs red, yellow, and orange wavelengths, reflecting blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. By analyzing the blocked wavelengths of light from WASP-96B, scientists identified a pattern consistent with the presence of H2O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

However, WASP-96B is not considered habitable due to its estimated temperature of over 530°C, making the chances of finding alien life there "next to none" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

### The [[Search for Extraterrestrial Life | Search for Extraterrestrial Life]] and Habitable Exoplanets

Our Milky Way galaxy is estimated to contain about 300 million potentially habitable planets where life could be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. To date, only about 5,000 exoplanets have been observed in total, though many are potentially habitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

A prime candidate for habitability, discovered in November 2018, is TRAPPIST-1E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. This planet is considered the most Earth-like exoplanet found so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. Located "merely" 40 light-years away (380 trillion km) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>, it orbits an ultra-cool dwarf star named TRAPPIST-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. Despite the star being cooler than our Sun, TRAPPIST-1E's closer orbit places it within the habitable zone, allowing for temperatures where liquid water can exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

TRAPPIST-1E's dimensions are also similar to Earth's:
*   Radius: 91% of Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>
*   Mass: 77% of Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>
*   Density: 102% of Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>
*   Surface Gravity: 93% of Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>

It has also been confirmed to have a solid rocky surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. In the coming months, the JWST will analyze TRAPPIST-1E's atmosphere for carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor; a specific combination of these gases could indicate the presence of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.

Scientists believe that for an exoplanet to sustain life, three main conditions must be present: liquid water, a solid surface, and an atmosphere with a specific combination of gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

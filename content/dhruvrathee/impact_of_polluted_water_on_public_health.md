The water quality of the Ganga River, particularly during mass gatherings like the [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | Mahakumbh]], poses significant public health concerns. Millions of people, who often show "unbreakable faith" by taking a dip in the holy water of the Ganga, may be exposed to hazardous conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Water Quality Indicators and Health Risks

The safety of river water for drinking or bathing is assessed using specific measurements, notably Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Faecal Coliform Bacteria (FCB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

### Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
BOD indicates the amount of oxygen required by aerobic microorganisms to break down organic matter in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. High BOD levels signify a large presence of organic material, such as sewage, waste, food waste, or decaying plant matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, which consumes oxygen and can lead to lower oxygen levels in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

*   **Ideal BOD for drinking:** 0 mg per litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) considers water drinkable if BOD is lower than 1 mg per litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Safe BOD for bathing:** Lower than 3 mg per litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Mahakumbh BOD levels:** At the Sangam, BOD levels were recorded as 3.94 mg/litre on January 13, 2025, and reached 5.09 mg/litre on January 16, almost double the bathing limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### Faecal Coliform Bacteria (FCB)
Faecal Coliform is a type of bacteria found in human and animal faeces and is a key indicator of [[water_quality_measurements_at_mahakumbh | water quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Its presence indicates contamination with sewage.

*   **Desirable FCB level:** 500 MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Maximum FCB for bathing:** 2,500 MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **WHO standard for drinkable water:** 0 MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Mahakumbh FCB levels:** On January 20, at the Sangam, FCB was found to be 49,000 MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, significantly exceeding the maximum limit for bathing. Before the Sangam, the Yamuna river had 33,000 MPN per 100 ml of FCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Sewage drains flowing into the river showed even higher levels, with the Jondhwal drain at 9.2 million MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Direct Health Consequences

Bathing in highly polluted water can lead to serious health issues:
*   **Skin diseases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>
*   **Gastrointestinal infections** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>
*   **Cholera** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>
*   **Typhoid** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>
*   **Hepatitis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>
*   **Other health problems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>

The CPCB report from 2022 indicated that approximately 70% of all waterborne diseases in India are caused by river water pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

### Post-Mahakumbh Health Reports
Following the [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | Mahakumbh]], a senior consultant at Delhi's Indraprastha Apollo Hospital reported that people returning from the event were experiencing medical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Symptoms included:
*   Diarrhoea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>
*   Vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>
*   Fevers of unknown origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>
*   Breathing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>

Despite anecdotal claims of individuals remaining healthy after exposure, scientific facts demonstrate the significant risks associated with polluted water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

## Government Denial and Misleading Claims

The government's Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) claimed that the water was suitable for bathing, initially submitting reports based on older water samples and lacking information on faecal coliform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) criticized the UPPCB for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Adityanath claimed the water at the Sangam was fit for both drinking and bathing, despite evidence of faecal bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

To counter negative reports, the government issued a press release citing an unverified report by "scientist" Dr. Ajay Sonkar, claiming "no bacterial growth" and "self-purifying properties" due to bacteriophages in the Ganga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. While bacteriophages exist and the Ganga possesses some self-cleaning properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>, existing research indicates that the pollution load has increased beyond the river's natural capacity to clean itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Research from IIT Delhi in 2023 also found a large number of disease-causing bacteria in Ganga water samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

Despite significant investment in the [[government_efforts_and_failures_to_clean_ganga | Namami Ganga Project]] (over â‚¹400 billion by 2024), the river's water remains unfit for bathing at many locations, and the deadline for cleaning has been repeatedly postponed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. The primary sources of pollution, such as sewage and industrial waste, continue to flow into the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.

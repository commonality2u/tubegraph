Gangster culture in India significantly impacts society, often through violence, extortion, and the glorification of criminal lifestyles in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

## Glorification vs. Reality
In movies and news channels, gangsters are frequently glorified, presented as stylish and powerful figures, leading many to admire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>. However, the reality of a gangster's life is starkly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>:
*   **Constant Fear** Gangsters live in continuous fear of being killed by rival gangs or in police encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.
*   **Incarceration** Many end up imprisoned, sometimes for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of Freedom** They lack the everyday freedoms enjoyed by ordinary people, such as visiting public places or celebrating festivals with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Health Issues** Some even struggle with depression due to isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.

## Impact on Families and Individuals
Choosing a life of crime has severe repercussions for a gangster's friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. Families are often destroyed financially and emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. For instance, the father of gangster Ankit Bhadu refused to claim his son's body after he was killed in a police encounter, stating it was the result of his son's actions and appealing to youth not to follow the same path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Additionally, family members, such as a gangster's father or wife, may also face arrest due to their connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>.

## Involvement in Student Politics
Gangsters often begin their criminal careers through [[role_of_student_politics_in_the_rise_of_gangsters | student politics]], using it as a stepping stone to build power and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Lawrence Bishnoi, for example, started by campaigning in student elections, leading to violent confrontations and arrests that introduced him to weapons suppliers and further criminal activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. This nexus between students, politicians, and gangsters can draw individuals into a criminal network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

## Criminal Activities and Their Reach
Gangster culture is characterized by widespread criminal activities:
*   **Murders** Gangs like the Lawrence-Kala Jathedi syndicate have been involved in numerous murders across states like Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan, destroying over 30 families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
*   **Extortion** Extortion rackets are a primary source of income, with gangs threatening individuals and businesses for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. These rackets can extend to local markets, where vendors are forced to pay for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>.
*   **Control over Industries** Gangs seek to establish their hold over various industries, such as the Punjab music industry and Kabaddi players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

## Influence on Media and Artists
The nexus between gangsters and the entertainment industry is significant, particularly in the Punjabi music scene. As artists gain popularity, they often receive extortion threats from gangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. Singers attending college events in Punjab are sometimes approached by goons who act as intermediaries between student politicians and gangsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. This can force artists into alliances with gangs for protection, inadvertently trapping them within the criminal underworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.

> An intelligence official noted, "the bad elements whose patronage is sought by the singers turn into the singer's Frankenstein's monster some time later." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>

## Conclusion
The impact of gangster culture is profound, extending from individual lives and families to the wider society and its institutions. It highlights the importance of pursuing lawful paths and seeking inspiration from individuals like Anil Bishnoi, who dedicate their lives to positive change, rather than succumbing to the dangerous allure of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>.

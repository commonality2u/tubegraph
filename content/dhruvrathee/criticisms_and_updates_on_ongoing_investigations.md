Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, carrying 227 passengers, 10 flight attendants, and 2 pilots, departed from Kuala Lumpur on March 8, 2014, at 12:42 AM, headed for Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The pilots were Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a 53-year-old senior captain, and First Officer Fariq Hamid, 27, who was on a training flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The flight proceeded normally for about 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

At 01:08 AM, the flight crossed the Malaysian coastline and reached the South China Sea, moving towards Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Captain Zaharie reported the plane at 35,000 feet, with everything normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Approximately 11 minutes later, the aircraft entered Vietnamese Air Traffic jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Kuala Lumpur Air Traffic Control instructed MH370 to contact Ho Chi Minh, to which Captain Zaharie responded, "Good night. MAS 370" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These were the last words received from the airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Initial Disappearance and Search Operations

Just 30 seconds after entering Vietnamese airspace, MH370 disappeared from civilian radar at 01:21 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Kuala Lumpur Air Traffic Control initially assumed the plane had flown out of their radar range into Vietnamese airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Meanwhile, Vietnamese Air Traffic Control observed the plane enter their airspace but then vanish from their radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. After 18 minutes of unsuccessful communication attempts, Vietnamese controllers informed Kuala Lumpur that MH370 had disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre in Kuala Lumpur should have been notified within an hour, but an emergency response only began after four hours, at 06:32 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, the time the plane was scheduled to land in Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

An immediate international search operation began in the South China Sea, involving 34 ships and 28 aircraft from seven countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. No trace of the plane was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Military Radar and Satellite Data

Four days later, on March 12, it was reported that military radar had spotted MH370 at 02:22 AM near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, west of Malaysia, above the Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This indicated the plane was flying north towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, away from Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Satellite data later revealed that the plane had attempted to automatically communicate with a satellite seven times, a process known as "Satellite Handshakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While no location data was transmitted, scientists used the angle of the satellite's antenna during these attempts to approximate the plane's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This analysis suggested the plane was somewhere within a large arc, known as the "7th Arc," extending from Kazakhstan, China, Indonesia to Australia, and covering a vast ocean area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Further calculations, based on the plane's speed and remaining fuel, narrowed the potential crash site to this 7th Arc, located 2,000 km west of Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This area was largely unexplored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Failed Search Attempts

Surface search operations were halted by April 2014, shifting focus to deep ocean searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This became the largest and most expensive search operation ever conducted, costing $160 million over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The operation was called off in 2017, deemed a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

In July 2015, the first piece of debris, a flaperon, was found on Réunion Island, east of Madagascar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. In 2018, an American company, Ocean Infinity, undertook a new search under a "No find, no fee" contract with the Malaysian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Equipped with advanced underwater surveillance vehicles, they mapped the ocean floor and discovered numerous underwater volcanoes, cliffs, and mountains in the 7th Arc area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Despite their efforts, this operation also failed to find the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Theories Behind the Disappearance

Investigations involved background checks on passengers and pilots to consider theories such as electrical or technical failure, accidental crash, or intentional disabling of communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Pilot Suicide Theory

One theory accused Captain Zaharie Shah of intentionally disabling communications and crashing the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Arguments supporting this included:
*   The plane's nearly 180° turn back towards Malaysia, which could not have been done by autopilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   The plane flying directly over the Thailand and Malaysia border, possibly to evade both countries' airspace radars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   The discovery that Zaharie Shah had a flight simulator at home on which he had mapped a path coincidentally similar to MH370's actual trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

However, the official in charge of the search denied this theory, citing that Zaharie was a highly experienced and respected pilot with no known family, economic, or behavioral problems that would suggest such an act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Hijacking/Terrorism Theory

Another theory suggested the involvement of hijackers or terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Two Iranian passengers traveling with stolen Italian and Austrian passports were initially suspected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. It was believed they intended to use these passports to reach Europe via Beijing and settle there, with one passenger's mother waiting in Hamburg, Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This theory was eventually rejected as there was no evidence of terrorist intent, and Interpol confirmed they were likely seeking to migrate to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Oxygen Deficiency Theory

The most probable theory suggests that the passengers and crew, including the pilots, became unconscious due to oxygen deficiency, causing the plane to continue flying on autopilot until it ran out of fuel and crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Possible causes for oxygen deficiency include an electrical fire in the cockpit or another accident leading to a sudden loss of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Under this scenario, pilots might have noticed malfunctions after entering Vietnamese airspace and turned the plane 180° back towards Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. An accident then caused oxygen deficiency, rendering everyone unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The plane then continued on autopilot, was spotted by military radar, turned southwards over the Indian Ocean, and eventually crashed 2,000 km west of Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

Other less likely theories included alien abduction, the US military shooting down the plane, Russian President Putin knowing its location, or a new Bermuda Triangle forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

## Recent Breakthrough and Future Prospects

In 2022, Richard Godfrey, a retired aerospace engineer, claimed to have pinpointed the location of MH370 using radio wave technologies, including data from the British Inmarsat Satellite, Boeing figures, Australian oceanographers, and WSPRnet amateur radio wave technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This complex technology uses reflections of radio waves to predict airplane paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Godfrey's calculations suggest MH370 lies on the 7th Arc, exactly at a specific point, 4 km underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Although this area was covered in earlier searches, Godfrey believes it might have been missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. He has identified the precise location with an accuracy of 40 Nautical Miles and proposes a new search operation within this smaller radius, which he believes would find the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

While some criticize Godfrey's methodology as not accurate enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, a drift analysis, examining ocean currents, supports his findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This analysis predicted that debris would reach Madagascar and surrounding islands, consistent with the 27 pieces of the plane found to date on various islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

Godfrey estimates that a new search operation could take only one year, potentially resolving the mystery by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. The combination of Godfrey's analysis and the drift analysis offers renewed hope for uncovering the fate of MH370 in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

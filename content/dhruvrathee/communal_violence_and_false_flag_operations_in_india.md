Communal tensions in India are often stoked by incidents designed to incite violence or spread fear, with the perpetrators sometimes turning out to be individuals or groups aiming to manipulate public sentiment for ulterior motives. Several instances highlight this phenomenon.

## Orchestrated Incidents and False Flags

In April of last year, a cow slaughter incident in Agra caused communal tensions. However, according to the UP police, the actual culprits were workers from the Hindu Mahasabha who were attempting to incite violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Similar incidents include:
*   **August 2022, Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh**: Meat was thrown in front of a Shiv temple, leading to communal violence. The man responsible, Chanchal Tripathi, paid a Muslim butcher â‚¹10,000 to throw the meat, intending to take revenge against SHO Hari Shyam Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **May 2020, Coimbatore**: Meat was thrown in front of a temple by Hari Ramprakash, an unemployed civil engineering graduate, who police stated was mentally disturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **February 2024, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh**: Four individuals were arrested for cow slaughter, one of whom was a leader in Bajrang Dal. They reportedly slaughtered the cow themselves to frame a Muslim man in a false case, even seeking help from another Muslim individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

These incidents point to a deliberate effort to create divisions and provoke communal unrest.

## The "WhatsApp Mafia" and its Propaganda Strategy

A "terrible mafia" is described as operating through WhatsApp and the media with the purpose of [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | brainwashing Hindus]] and making them pliable to certain narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This "mafia" reportedly operates through four departments:
1.  **Instilling Pride and Arrogance**: Telling Hindus, especially those of so-called upper castes, that they are great simply by virtue of their birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  **Creating Victimhood**: Showing Hindus as pitiful victims who have been "tortured for centuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
3.  **Generating Fear**: Convincing Hindus that they are in danger from specific groups who "can attack you at any time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
4.  **Promoting a "Messiah" Figure**: Portraying Narendra Modi as the sole savior who will protect them, thus encouraging votes for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Historically, dictators have often targeted the majority community, as seen in Pakistan where Sunni Muslims are brainwashed with fake news about threats from minorities like Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, and various Muslim sects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Pakistani school books have been shown to contain hateful propaganda against Hindus and Sikhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This manipulation leads to societal breakdown and economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## [[selective_outrage_and_media_narratives_in_india | Selective Outrage]] and Media Bias

Manipulation of news to instil fear within a majority community is not new. In 1919 America, Washington newspapers suppressed news of a Black criminal attacking a Black woman but made it front-page news when the same criminal attacked a white woman, leading to riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Similar patterns are observed in India today:
*   **Shraddha Walker Case**: The brutal murder of Shraddha Walker by her Muslim boyfriend, Aftab Ameen Poonawalla, was heavily exploited by pro-government media to spread hatred against all Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The National Broadcasting and Digital Standards Authority (NBDSA) imposed fines on News18 and Times Now Nav Bharat for spreading this hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The narrative "My Abdul Isn't Like This" was widely used on social media to generalize Muslim men as potential murderers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Neha-Fayaz Case**: The murder of Hindu girl Neha by Muslim man Fayaz in Karnataka again triggered a wave of hatred against all Muslims by right-wing influencers and the "WhatsApp mafia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Cases Ignored by Biased Media
Numerous cases with similar gruesome details but without a Hindu-Muslim angle are largely ignored by the same media:
*   **Anjan Das Murder**: Two weeks after the Shraddha Walker case, Anjan Das was killed by his wife Poonam, and his body was chopped and stored in a fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Nikki Yadav Murder**: Sahil Gahlot killed his live-in partner Nikki Yadav and stored her body in a fridge at his restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Sonam Parveen Murder**: Aman Kumar Singh, a Hindu boy, killed 17-year-old Muslim girl Sonam Parveen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. News18 Hindi published the news but omitted the boy's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Eesha Murder**: Anshu, a Hindu man, killed his love marriage partner Naima (aka Eesha), a Muslim woman, and threw her body into a well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Gulnaz Khatoon Murder**: Gulnaz Khatoon, a 20-year-old Muslim woman, was burned alive by Satish Kumar Rai and his friends for refusing a marriage proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Rekha and Daughter Murder**: Ramanuj Sahu, a Hindu man, stabbed his wife Rekha 10 times and killed his 19-year-old daughter when she tried to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Vipul Singh's Threats**: Vipul Singh, a Hindu man, openly threatened to molest and kill Muslim women, leading to police action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Aynaz and Family Murder**: Praveen Arun, a Hindu man, killed his 21-year-old air hostess colleague Aynaz (Muslim) and her family members (mother, elder sister, 14-year-old brother) after she stopped communicating with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Rukhsar aka Riya Murder**: Rukhsar (Muslim) was killed by her live-in partner Vipul Tailor (Hindu) and her body was stuffed in a cupboard. Dainik Jagran did not mention the girl's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Rukhsana Murder**: Pradeep (Hindu) killed Rukhsana (Muslim) after she wanted to marry him, and they had a child together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

These cases, where Hindu men are perpetrators, are often ignored by biased media to avoid disrupting the desired narrative. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report "Crime in India 2022" shows that out of 8,125 female murder victims, permutations of perpetrator and victim religions are numerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. However, [[selective_outrage_and_media_narratives_in_india | brainwashed individuals]] only react when the murderer is Muslim and the victim is Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### Silence on BJP-Connected Crimes
The "WhatsApp mafia" and supporting politicians remain silent when a Hindu woman is killed by a Hindu man, especially if there's a BJP connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Kuldeep Singh Case**: In December 2019, former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh was convicted for kidnapping and molesting, with many witnesses dying. His supporters held rallies in his support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **IIT-BHU Accused**: Three accused in a case from IIT-BHU, Kunal Pandey, Saksham Patel, and Abhishek Chauhan, were part of the BJP IT cell's Varanasi unit and had photos with senior BJP leaders. No concern was shown for the Hindu female victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Ankita Bhandari Case**: 19-year-old Ankita Bhandari was allegedly molested and murdered by Pulkit Arya, the son of former BJP politician Vinod Arya. The victim's father struggled to file an FIR, and a journalist who highlighted the case was arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

In contrast, Muslim organizations like Jamaat-e-Islami Hind and Anjuman-e-Islam have condemned crimes by Muslim perpetrators and demanded severe punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

## Political Propaganda and [[fake_news_in_indian_media | Fake News]]

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of spreading lies to instil fear and secure votes. For example, his claim that the Congress party would redistribute wealth to "those who have more children" (referring to Muslims) is unsubstantiated by the Congress manifesto, which focuses on education, healthcare, and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. The stereotype that Muslims have more children is also challenged by government reports showing that fertility rates are linked to female literacy, not religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

### Fabricated Stories to Incite Hatred
When real news is insufficient, fake news is propagated to maintain fear and division:
*   **"Rashid Khan" Identity Theft**: In the Shraddha Walker case, a man justifying the murder was initially identified as Rashid Khan, but police arrested him to find his real name was Vikas Kumar, pretending to be Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   **"Rajiya Bano" Facebook Post**: A viral Facebook post justifying crimes against Hindu women as "revenge" was attributed to "Rajiya Bano." Fact-checking revealed the username was wrong, and a man named Pawan Sharma was hiding behind the profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
*   **Cow Slaughter Framing**: Members of Bajrang Dal and Hindu Mahasabha have been caught slaughtering cows themselves to frame Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Misrepresented Videos**: A video of girls beating a man, identified as Kapil Chauhan for harassing them, was circulated with the caption celebrating "Hindu girls teaching a lesson to love jihadis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

### Targeting Critics with False Narratives
Anyone who criticizes the ruling party is often subjected to similar smear campaigns:
*   **Rashid Alvi's "Ram Devotees as Demons"**: Congress leader Rashid Alvi's statement was intentionally clipped to falsely portray him as calling Ram devotees "demons." He was actually referring to a Ramayan story where demons disguised themselves as sages and chanted "Jai Shri Ram" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Ravish Kumar Accusations**: Journalist Ravish Kumar has been falsely accused of protecting a "terrorist Shahrukh" by calling him "Brahmin Anurag Mishra" (a clipped video) and of never speaking about Kashmiri Pandits or criticizing Congress (despite evidence to the contrary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
*   **Personal Attacks**: Individuals like Dhruv Rathee, who criticize the BJP, are targeted with false claims about their identity, religion, and family (e.g., claiming his real name is Badru Rashid and his wife is Pakistani) to project them as Muslim or Pakistani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

This persistent propagation of lies aims to instill fear in Hindus, portraying critics as non-Hindu or anti-Hindu, thus manipulating public opinion and undermining democratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

Following the initial successes of the Apollo program, particularly the historic Apollo 11 mission when Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, public and governmental interest in continued space exploration began to wane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Apollo 13, launched less than a year after Armstrong's moonwalk, was already the third NASA mission to send humans to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Fading Interest

The initial push for human moon landings stemmed from American President John F. Kennedy's 1961 promise to land a man on the moon before the decade's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This goal was set within the context of the [[cold_war_impact_on_space_race | Cold War]] and the broader space race with the Soviet Union, where technological leadership was a key objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

With the successful return of Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 astronauts from the moon in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, Kennedy's promise was fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, this success had an unforeseen consequence: a drastic decrease in both public and governmental interest in spending on space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. While the first moon landing generated immense excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, subsequent missions did not sustain the same level of public engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. People began to view missions like Apollo 13 as merely "another routine flight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Governmental Response and NASA's Challenge

Due to the fading interest, the American government cut NASA's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Many planned [[future_plans_for_moon_exploration | future missions]], such as Apollo 20, were cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This made the Apollo 13 mission crucial for NASA, as the agency needed to prove to the government that continued investment in space was worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

The primary objective of Apollo 13 was not only to survey the moon's soil but also to develop human capabilities for working in the moon's environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Despite its importance, the public turnout for Apollo 13's launch was significantly smaller compared to Apollo 11, with 200,000 spectators versus 7 million for the previous mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This stark difference reinforced NASA's realization of the public's quickly diminishing interest in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Even a planned live television broadcast from the spacecraft's interior garnered such low interest that no television network showed it at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

## Apollo 13's Impact and the End of the Apollo Program

The Apollo 13 incident, though a mission failure in terms of its moon landing objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, became a historic rescue mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. The bravery of the astronauts and the collaborative problem-solving from the ground control team, highlighting teamwork, leadership, and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, ensured the safe return of the crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

After a thorough investigation into the incident, NASA adopted many new [[impact_of_apollo_13_on_future_nasa_missions | safety measures]] to prevent similar accidents in future missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Subsequent Apollo missions (Apollo 14, 15, 16, and 17) were all successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. However, Apollo 17, launched on December 7, 1972, marked the last NASA mission under the Apollo program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. The astronauts on this mission spent three days on the moon's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>, and it remains the last time humans have traveled to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

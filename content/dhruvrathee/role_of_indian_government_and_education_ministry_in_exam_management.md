The Indian government and its Education Ministry, through agencies like the National Testing Agency (NTA), play a crucial role in managing national examinations. However, recent events surrounding the NEET pre-medical exam have brought their effectiveness and transparency into question, highlighting significant concerns about exam integrity and student futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET)

The NEET-UG is the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test for Undergraduates, serving as the sole undergraduate admission exam for all medical, dental, and AYUSH courses across India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Introduced in 2013 to replace various state and medical college pre-medical exams like the AIPMT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, it faced initial protests from states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, West Bengal, and Tamil Nadu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The first NEET exam was conducted in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

For its first three years, the NEET exams were overseen by CBSE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## National Testing Agency (NTA)

Since 2019, the responsibility for conducting the NEET exam has been given to the [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | National Testing Agency (NTA)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The NTA is an autonomous agency established in November 2017 under the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Initial Hopes vs. Current Reality
When the NTA was formed, there were hopes that it would maintain independence, ensure greater transparency in exam conduct, and increase public confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. However, the opposite has occurred, with public anger now largely directed towards the NTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Irregularities and Allegations in NEET 2024

The [[neet_2024_exam_irregularities_and_fraud | NEET 2024 exam irregularities and fraud]] and subsequent results have led to widespread commotion and allegations of a large-scale scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

#### Pre-Exam Issues
Problems began before the exam, with the NTA extending the registration deadline multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Initially set for March 9th, it was extended by a week, and then the registration link was reopened on April 9th-10th "on the request of the 'stakeholders'," followed by a correction window from April 11th-15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

#### [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | Paper Leaks and Misconduct]]
Despite the pre-exam issues, the exam was conducted on May 5th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. However, news of multiple [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | paper leaks]] emerged from various states like Gujarat, Bihar, and Odisha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Patna police arrested 13 individuals for leaking exam papers, with charges of ₹3-5 million per student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. An entire racket was busted in Gujarat involving an education consultancy owner, a school teacher, and a BJP leader, charging ₹1 million per student for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The Indian Express has reported 41 paper leaks in the last five years, affecting 14 million job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

#### Post-Result Irregularities
The declaration of results on June 4th revealed "unbelievable irregularities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>:

*   **Unprecedented Perfect Scores**: 67 students scored a perfect 720/720, all receiving All India Rank 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This is highly unusual, as only 2 students achieved this in 2023, 4 in 2022 (with a highest score of 715), and 3 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **NTA's Explanations and Their Flaws**:
    *   **"Easy Exam"**: An NTA official claimed the exam was very easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, contradicting students and experts who found it tough and predicted lower average scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   **Increased Candidates**: NTA cited 300,000 more candidates this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   **Grace Marks**: NTA admitted that 50 of the 67 toppers received grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
        *   44 students received grace marks due to discrepancies in answer keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
        *   6 students received grace marks due to time-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
        *   A physics question had two correct answers due to differences in old and new NCERT textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. NTA stated that it received over 13,000 complaints about this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Impossible Scores and Suspicious Grace Marks**: Some students received scores like 718 or 719, which are technically impossible under normal scoring (4 marks for correct, -1 for incorrect, leading to scores like 720, 716, or 715, but not 718/719) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. These scores were possible only due to grace marks. Two students with such scores were from the same Jhajjar Centre as the 6 toppers who received grace marks for time loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Misapplication of Supreme Court Judgment**: NTA justified grace marks for time loss by referring to a 2018 Supreme Court judgment related to the CLAT exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, this judgment explicitly states it cannot be used for engineering and medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **OMR Sheet Discrepancies**: Many students reported significant differences between their OMR sheet scores and their final results, with some cases showing an 80-mark difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Early Results Declaration**: The results were declared 10 days in advance on June 4th, the same day as the 2024 General Election results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This timing raised suspicions of an attempt to cover up the alleged scam amidst the media's focus on elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Government and Ministry Response

The widespread concerns have prompted various responses from the government and other entities:

*   **Supreme Court Intervention**: The Supreme Court has directed the NTA to provide answers, stating that "The sanctity of the exam has been affected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Political Pressure**: Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, Sanjay Singh, Akhilesh Yadav, and MK Stalin, have demanded an investigation and promised to raise the issue in Parliament <a class="yt="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Education Panel**: On June 8th, the NTA announced that the Education Ministry would set up a four-member panel to examine the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Partial Concession on Grace Marks**: NTA has finally agreed to remove the grace marks, offering the 1,563 affected candidates the option to either retake the exam or accept their score without grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. However, questions regarding paper leaks, inflated scores, and multiple toppers from the same centre remain unanswered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Role of the Education Minister

Dharmendra Pradhan, appointed as the Education Minister in 2021 and re-appointed after the 2024 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, has faced criticism for his perceived lack of focus on educational issues. His social media activity, for instance, is seen as more akin to a "Narendra Modi's PR Minister" than an Education Minister, with frequent mentions of the Prime Minister but a notable absence of tweets concerning the NEET exam or education in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Critics argue that accountability is necessary for addressing the widespread mismanagement and wrongdoings in the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Broader Implications
The situation underscores a broader crisis in the integrity of Indian exams, with widespread [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | paper leaks]] and irregularities becoming common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This impacts the future of students, who study under immense pressure and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The lack of accountability from governing bodies and leaders leads to frustration, contributing to tragic outcomes like the more than 13,000 student suicides reported in 2022 due to depression from the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

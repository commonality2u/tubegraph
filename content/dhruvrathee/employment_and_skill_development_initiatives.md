The government's Economic Survey for 2023-2024 highlighted the significant challenge of [[economic_challenges_and_unemployment_in_bangladesh | unemployment]] and proposed various solutions within the Budget 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Unemployment Challenges
The Economic Survey projected a need to create 7.85 million jobs annually until 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. A key issue identified is that one out of two Indian graduates is deemed unemployable due to a lack of sufficient skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. CMIE data from early 2024 indicated that the [[economic_challenges_and_unemployment_in_bangladesh | unemployment]] rate for the 20-24 age group reached 44.49% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also noted as a major factor contributing to job uncertainty across all skill levels, being described as the "biggest disruption for the future of work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Government Initiatives
The Finance Minister announced five schemes with an outlay of ₹2 trillion aimed at addressing employment and skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>:

1.  **First Time Employment Support**
    This scheme offers up to ₹15,000 from the government to individuals joining their first job and registered with the Government's EPFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
2.  **Manufacturing Sector Benefits**
    Increased benefits have been provided for both employees and employers specifically within the manufacturing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
3.  **Employer Support**
    To encourage employers to hire more, the government will contribute up to ₹3,000 per month for two years to the EPFO on behalf of employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
4.  **Skilling Scheme**
    A new [[alternative_employment_opportunities_and_skill_development | Skilling Scheme]] has been promised, aiming to help 2 million youth acquire new skills over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
5.  **Internship Opportunities**
    The government has pledged to provide internship opportunities for 1 million youth in the top 500 companies for 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. This initiative was also part of the opposition party's manifesto and is seen as a positive step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

## Implementation Concerns
Despite the announcement of these schemes, there is skepticism regarding their implementation. The Finance Minister has stated that these job schemes will not be compulsory for companies but rather a "nudge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This raises questions about how many companies will actually adopt and implement them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

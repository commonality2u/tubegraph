The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is an infamous stretch of water in the Atlantic Ocean associated with mysterious disappearances of ships and aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This area, spanning over 500,000 square miles, is located between Florida in the USA, Puerto Rico, and the country of Bermuda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## Notable Incidents

Tales of the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] date back over 500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. In 1492, Christopher Columbus reported his compass stopped working and he saw a strange, ball-of-fire-like light fall into the ocean while passing through this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Scientists suggest this light was likely a meteor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.

Over the centuries, the area acquired names like "The Graveyard of the Atlantic," "The Sea of Doom," and "Sargasso Graveyard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. The specific term "Bermuda Triangle" was first used in 1964 by Vincent H. Gaddis in an *Argosy* magazine article titled 'The Deadly Bermuda Triangle,' which summarized many disappearances to create a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### [[flight_19_disappearance_and_search_efforts | Flight 19]] (1945)

On December 5, 1945, five US Navy torpedo bomber aircraft, known as [[flight_19_disappearance_and_search_efforts | Flight 19]], took off from Florida for a routine three-hour training mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Led by experienced pilot Lt. Charles Carol Taylor, the flight had 14 crew members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

About two hours after takeoff, the squadron leader reported that their compasses had stopped working, and backup compasses also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Confusing radio messages followed, indicating disorientation among the pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Taylor believed they were over the Gulf of Mexico and ordered them to fly east to return to Florida, but some crew members thought they were already east of Florida and needed to fly west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. The weather worsened, and by 7:04 PM, the last radio transmission from Taylor was received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. All five planes and their 14 crew members were lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

In the subsequent search for [[flight_19_disappearance_and_search_efforts | Flight 19]], a Mariner search-and-rescue aircraft with 13 crew members also took off and disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. A large-scale air-and-sea search operation followed, but no wreckage or bodies from either flight were ever found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. The area where both planes disappeared is now known as the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### USS Cyclops (1918)

In 1918, the USS Cyclops, one of the largest and fastest ships of the US Navy, disappeared with 306 people aboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Carrying 11,000 tonnes of manganese, the ship began its nine-day journey from the West Indies Baltimore towards Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Its departure message was the last ever heard from it, shocking everyone how such a massive ship could suddenly vanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

### The Ellen Austin Mystery (1881) - An Urban Legend

The Ellen Austin, a 210-foot ship, encountered an unidentified ship near the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] area in 1881 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. The encountered ship appeared normal but had no crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. After two days of waiting, the captain of the Ellen Austin boarded the ship, finding valuable items intact, suggesting no piracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. He decided to send some of his crew to sail it alongside his ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

After two days, a storm separated the ships, and when the Ellen Austin's captain found the other ship again, his transferred crew members had disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. The story claims this happened a second time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Although intriguing, this incident is considered an urban legend, as it is too old to be properly verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

## Theories Explaining Disappearances

Many [[theories_and_suspects_in_the_db_cooper_case | theories]] exist to explain the disappearances in the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

### Outlandish Theories

Some theories are considered outlandish, such as:
*   **Alien Abduction**: Claims that aliens abducted the aircraft and ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
*   **Giant Sea Monster**: Belief that a giant sea monster under the ocean is responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   **Peculiar Ocean Area**: General claims that the area itself is peculiar, causing vessels to drown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

### [[scientific_perspectives_on_the_bermuda_triangle_phenomena | Scientific Perspectives]]

More [[scientific_perspectives_on_the_bermuda_triangle_phenomena | scientific theories]] attempt to explain the phenomena:

*   **Magnetism (Agonic Lines)**: The Earth's magnetic North Pole and Geographic North Pole are distinct points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Normally, compass users account for this difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. However, there are "Agonic Lines" where the Magnetic and Geographic North Poles align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. For the last 200-300 years, the 0° agonic line has been in or around the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] area, which can cause confusion for navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.

*   **Shallow Waters and Hidden Shoals**: Parts of the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] are quite shallow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. In older times, ships could get stuck on hidden shoals—underwater land formations not visible from the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

*   **High Frequency of Hurricanes and Water Spouts**: The [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] area experiences one of the highest rates of hurricanes in the world, with Cuba and Florida (both within the triangle) being frequently hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. Hurricanes and water spouts can easily cause ships to sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.

*   **Methane Hydrates**: Some ocean areas contain large fields of methane hydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Laboratory experiments have shown that an excess of methane bubbles in water lowers its density, causing ships to lose buoyancy and sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. If methane eruptions (or "mud volcanoes") occur underwater when a ship is overhead, the vessel could instantly sink without warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. However, there is no direct evidence that any specific disappearance in the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] was caused by methane hydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

### Psychological Explanations (Baader-Meinhof Effect)

The **Baader-Meinhof Effect**, or **Frequency Illusion**, is a psychological phenomenon where one starts noticing something more often after becoming aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. This effect is suggested to explain the [[theories_about_the_disappearance_of_mh370 | Bermuda Triangle]] mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.

While some large vessels and aircraft have indeed disappeared in the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]], similar disappearances occur in other ocean areas worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. For example, the [[disappearance_of_malaysian_airlines_flight_mh370 | Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370]] did not disappear near the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. The argument is that once the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] mystery gained popularity, people started paying more attention to incidents within its boundaries, while similar events elsewhere were largely ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

Journalist Larry Kusche, author of 'The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved,' concluded that while some incidents did occur, the prominence of the mystery led to "mystery-mongering" and the creation of absurd or fabricated stories, like the Ellen Austin case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

## Debunking the Myth

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US states there is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur more frequently in the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] than in any other ocean area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. The United States Coast Guard does not recognize the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] as a uniquely hazardous area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.

> "The fact that the area within the Bermuda Triangle is heavily trafficked could account for some of the mystery." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>
> "Pair that with the fact that the Bermuda Triangle is often swept by hurricanes, and the presence of the Gulf Stream, it is not hard to see why ships might occasionally sink there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>

In a 2013 study by the WWF on the world's 10 most dangerous bodies of water for shipping, the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] was not on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. This suggests that the mysterious disappearances are not uniquely tied to the [[history_and_incidents_of_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]], and the phenomena can largely be explained by conventional environmental factors and human perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

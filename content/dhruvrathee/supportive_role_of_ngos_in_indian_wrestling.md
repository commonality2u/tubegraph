Sports NGOs have played a significant role in supporting Indian wrestlers by providing crucial resources, particularly in coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Notably, organizations like Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ) and JSW have been instrumental in this effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

## Providing Coaching Support

These NGOs have brought in foreign coaches, such as Woller Akos (Vinesh Phogat's coach) and Shako Bentindis (Bajrang Punia's Georgian coach), who have made substantial contributions to the success of Indian wrestlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. For instance, Akos was vital in honing Vinesh Phogat's concentration, motivation, and technique since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. He facilitated Vinesh's practice with wrestlers from various countries to help her reach top levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Akos even left his one-year-old son in Hungary during the Covid pandemic to help Vinesh at the Lucknow Camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## [[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | WFI Opposition]]

Despite the positive impact of these NGOs, the [[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | Wrestling Federation of India (WFI)]] has expressed objections to their involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The WFI explicitly instructed NGOs to cease their "interference," claiming that these organizations were "spoiling" wrestlers and that the WFI could manage its athletes independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

In November 2021, the WFI imposed a rule requiring its involvement before JSW and OGQ could enter into any contracts with wrestlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This stance raised questions about the WFI's commitment to athlete welfare, particularly when Vinesh Phogat was denied a dedicated physiotherapist during the Tokyo Olympics despite repeated requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Critics argue that the WFI's refusal to hire good coaches and its obstruction of NGO support hinders the progress of Indian wrestlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

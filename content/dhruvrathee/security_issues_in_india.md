Prosperity in any nation is built upon a foundation of peace, which inherently includes safety and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This encompasses a variety of aspects, from external threats to internal stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Types of Security Concerns

India faces numerous security challenges that impact the lives of its citizens:

*   **Border Security**: The nation must be prepared to defend against external aggression and infiltration attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Terrorism**: India has experienced a series of significant terrorist attacks, including:
    *   Parliament attack in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>
    *   Mumbai attacks in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>
    *   Gurdaspur attack in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>
    *   Pulwama attack in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>
    *   Jaipur-Mumbai Express attack in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>
    *   Recent attacks in Reasi, Doda, and Kathua <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>
    Between 2017 and 2022, Jammu & Kashmir alone saw 761 terrorist attacks, resulting in 174 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Riots and Communal Clashes**: Incidents driven by religious or ethnic differences pose a significant threat. Examples include the 2020 Delhi riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. From 2017 to 2021, over 2,900 cases of communal and religious rioting were registered nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. In Manipur, recent conflicts led to over 219 deaths, 10,000 FIRs, and displaced over 60,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Lynchings**: These acts of mob violence occur due to religious motives or rumors spread via platforms like WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Notable cases include those of Chandan Gupta, Pehlu Khan, Tabrez Ansari, and Akhlaq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, as well as the Palgarh lynching of two sadhus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> and the murder of software engineer Mohammad Azam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Crime**:
    *   **Murders**: In 2022, 28,522 murder cases were registered across the country, averaging about 78 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Hit and Run/Road Rage**: India saw 67,387 hit and run cases, with 30,486 resulting in fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Accidents due to Negligence/Infrastructure**:
    *   **Building Collapses**: In 2.5 years, 1,177 people died in large building incidents across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Open Pits and Manholes**: At least two people die daily in India from falling into open pits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. From 2015 to 2020, 5,393 people died this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Railway Accidents**: While the number of railway accidents has decreased over the last 60 years, the goal should be near-zero given technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. In 2023, 2,590 people died on Mumbai Suburban Railway tracks alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Bridge Collapses**: The 2022 Morbi Bridge Collapse in Gujarat killed 135 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Illegal Hoardings**: In Mumbai, 16 people died due to the collapse of an illegally installed hoarding that exceeded permissible dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Bad Medicines**: In 2019, 12 children died in Jammu, allegedly from toxic cough syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## The Value of Life and Constitutional Rights

The perceived cheapness of a common person's life needs to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. The Constitution of India guarantees the Right to Equality under Article 14, asserting that everyone is equal before the law and receives equal protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. Ensuring this principle is implemented in spirit is crucial for universal safety and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## Approaches to Solving Security Issues

Solving problems involves three main steps:
1.  **Diagnosing the Problem**: Identifying exactly what is wrong and its root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Accepting the Problem**: Acknowledging the issue rather than sweeping it under the carpet or suppressing reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
3.  **Taking the Right Action**: Implementing appropriate solutions based on the diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

Many politicians often ignore the first two steps, focusing on rhetoric instead of acknowledging and addressing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. This leads to underreporting of crimes, especially [[womens_safety_in_india | crime against women]], as seen in government surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. A truly democratic society requires a strong, fearless media to report on safety issues without intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

### Preventive and Punitive Solutions

Solutions to security issues can be categorized as preventive (stopping problems before they occur) or punitive (punishing those who cause problems to deter others) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

#### Cross-Border Security
*   **Preventive**: Cultivating an effective foreign policy and building strong relations with neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.
*   **Punitive**: Ensuring the country is prepared to counter any attack if diplomacy fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This includes providing the Indian Armed Forces with all necessary equipment, including guns, ammunition, bullet-proof jackets, night vision goggles, naval ships, and fighter aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. These items should be readily available, ideally through internal manufacturing or by outsourcing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

#### [[security_concerns_and_resource_allocation_in_india | Resource Allocation and Military Well-being]]
*   **Research and Development**: The budget for defense research should be increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. Regular inspections are necessary to prevent deaths due to [[faulty_weapons_and_defense_issues_in_india | malfunctioning equipment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Health of Soldiers**: This is a critical, often overlooked area. In five years, 819 armed forces personnel died by suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. A proposed solution is to hire 1,800 mental health practitioners for the 1.2 million active Indian Army personnel, mirroring the US Army's 1:700 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. This initiative would save lives and create new government jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>, eventually extending to paramilitary forces and police nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.

#### Funding and [[security_concerns_and_resource_allocation_in_india | Corruption]]
Increased investment in education infrastructure is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>, which can be funded by:
*   **Corporate Tax**: Reverting corporate tax rates to 2017-18 levels could generate an additional ₹1 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.
*   **Budget Reallocation**: Significant funds spent on highways (approx. ₹2 trillion) primarily benefit the 8% of Indian families who own cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. This money could be reallocated to education and human-centric urban development to reduce pollution and heat island effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.
*   **Ending Corruption**: Corruption undermines safety and security, leading to issues like illegal hoardings and adulterated medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. Key reasons for corruption include:
    *   **Top-down approach**: A chain of corruption that starts from the highest levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Overworked and Underpaid Officials**: Police officers and government employees often work long hours without proper pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Greed**: Though less significant, it can be mitigated by addressing the first two reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>.
Solutions include doubling the number of police personnel, increasing judges and courts to manage caseloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>, and implementing strict laws and harsh punishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.

#### Police Reforms
People often perceive state police as unable to properly investigate important cases, frequently demanding transfer to the CBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. To address this, every state should establish a CBI-type investigative agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>. Reforms would also include:
*   Ensuring good salaries, mental healthcare, insurance, and family benefits for all police and government officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.
*   Strict 8-hour work limits and filling all vacancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.
*   Promoting respect and courtesy between police and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>.

#### Mindset Change for [[womens_safety_in_india | Women's Safety]]
Addressing issues like sexual harassment requires changing societal mindsets that view women as inferior or objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>. While upholding freedom of expression, there can be requests to remove misogyny from films and songs, and a promotion of good content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>. Introducing gender sensitization classes in schools from childhood can also foster the right mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.

#### [[faulty_weapons_and_defense_issues_in_india | Illegal Weapons]]
To eliminate illegal weapon possession, India could implement an "Amnesty Period" similar to Australia and Serbia. During this period, citizens could surrender illegal weapons to the government without facing legal repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>. Serbia, for example, collected over 1 million illegal weapons within a month using this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.

## Vision for a Safe India

By implementing these preventive and punitive measures, India can become a nation that is safe and secure for both its citizens and foreign visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. The transformation of Singapore from a struggling nation in the 1960s to the 5th most peaceful country on the Global Peace Index 2024 demonstrates that such aspirations are achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. The goal is for India to become the world's most peaceful and prosperous country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>.

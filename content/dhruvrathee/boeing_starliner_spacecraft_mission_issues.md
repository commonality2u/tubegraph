The Boeing Starliner spacecraft, officially known as the Crew Space Transportation-100 (CST-100) Starliner, launched from America on June 5, 2024, at 10:52 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The mission carried two experienced NASA astronauts, Commander Barry E. Wilmore and Pilot Sunita Williams, on a planned short trip to the International Space Station (ISS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The Starliner is noteworthy because it was built by the private company Boeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This specific mission, named the "Boeing Crew Flight Test," was intended as the final step to test the Starliner's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Initial Success and Milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
Approximately 27 hours after launch, on June 6, 2024, at 1:34 PM, the Starliner successfully docked with the International Space Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This achievement made Boeing the world's second private company, after [[SpaceX versus Boeing in commercial space missions | SpaceX]], to successfully build and fly a human orbital spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Historically, only three countries—Russia, the USA, and China—have accomplished this feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Astronauts Stranded in Space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
Despite the initial success, the celebration was short-lived. The Starliner mission was originally planned for only 8 days, but as of three months later, both astronauts remain stranded in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Numerous problems with the spacecraft have rendered it unusable for return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. NASA has indicated that the astronauts are expected to stay on the ISS for a total of 8 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Astronaut Safety and Life on the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
Although the astronauts are unable to return, NASA assures that they are not in danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The International Space Station is over 350 feet long and can comfortably accommodate many people, with living and working space larger than a 6-bedroom house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The ISS is well-equipped with sufficient food, water, oxygen, two bathrooms, a gym, and a 360-degree view bay window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The ISS has its own oxygen-generating system through water electrolysis and also recycles exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. A robust water recycling system converts urine into drinking water and captures moisture from breath and sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The station carries a 6-month food reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams are highly experienced astronauts. Wilmore, 61, had spent 178 days in space before this mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Williams, 58, of Indian origin, had spent 322 days in space across previous expeditions and even commanded Expedition 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. They have been integrated into Expeditions 71 and 72, conducting research and experiments alongside other international astronauts from NASA and the Russian Space Agency Roscosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Their personal belongings and additional clothes were sent to the ISS on August 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## The Starliner Spacecraft and Its Problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>

### Orbital Spacecraft Definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>
The Starliner is an orbital spacecraft, meaning it is launched at high velocities (over 28,000 km/h) to reach and orbit Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This distinguishes it from suborbital spacecraft, which only reach the edge of space briefly before returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Building a human-capable orbital spacecraft is significantly more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. India's Gaganyaan mission aims to achieve this, with an uncrewed orbital test flight scheduled for December 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Development History <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
NASA initiated its Commercial Crew Program in 2011 to collaborate with private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. In 2014, [[SpaceX versus Boeing in commercial space missions | SpaceX]] and Boeing were selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. [[SpaceX versus Boeing in commercial space missions | SpaceX's]] Crew Dragon spacecraft successfully launched its first Crew-1 flight in November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The Starliner's design includes a crew module for up to 7 people, a window, a side hatch, and thrusters for flight and maneuvering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. These thrusters ultimately became the source of the mission's problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Chronology of Issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

**Launch Delays:**
*   **May 6, 2024:** The initial launch was halted just 2 hours before liftoff due to a faulty pressure valve in the Atlas V rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **June 1, 2024:** A second attempt was canceled only 4 minutes before launch by a computer abort system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

**Helium Leaks:**
Before the successful June 5 launch, engineers were already managing a helium leak caused by a defective seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Helium is crucial for the propulsion system and thruster operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Although initially deemed manageable, two more leaks were discovered hours after launch, and a fourth leak was found as the Starliner approached the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The Commercial Crew Program Manager at Boeing admitted they did not understand the root cause, indicating a systemic problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

**Thruster Malfunctions:**
Hours before docking, 5 out of the 28 thrusters on the Starliner were not working properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Commander Barry Wilmore had to manually control the spacecraft, resetting the thrusters with ground engineers. Four of the five thrusters began working again, allowing successful docking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. NASA's Steve Stich attributed this to a data issue rather than a hardware problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

**Overheating Concern:**
Subsequent hot fire tests revealed that the thrusters were overheating due to direct sunlight exposure on the capsule's manual control system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. While the thrusters operated normally when tested without sunlight, engineers could not guarantee the problem wouldn't recur during the return journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### Decision for Astronaut Return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
Prioritizing safety, NASA decided the Starliner would return to Earth uncrewed, leaving the astronauts on the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This decision echoed concerns from the [[Columbia Space Shuttle disaster | 2003 Columbia disaster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore are now scheduled to return to Earth in February 2025 via [[SpaceX versus Boeing in commercial space missions | SpaceX's]] Crew Dragon spacecraft, as part of the Crew-9 mission, extending their stay to approximately 9 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Boeing Starliner's Previous Test Failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>
NASA's Steve Stich, while calling Starliner a "very capable spacecraft," acknowledged its past failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

*   **Orbital Flight Test (OFT-1), December 2019:** This uncrewed test, carrying the doll Rosie the Rocketeer, was aborted after only 2 days and failed to dock with the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. An investigation found that the Starliner's thrusters failed to fire on time due to a miscalibration in the computer system's timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Stich admitted that NASA's oversight of Boeing was insufficient, leading to these software problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

*   **Boeing Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2), May 2022:** This test was successful, with Rosie the Rocketeer reaching the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. However, even in this successful flight, glitches occurred, including thrusters not operating properly—a recurring issue seen in the current crewed mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Boeing's Broader Challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>
Despite Boeing receiving a larger contract of $4.2 billion from NASA in 2014 compared to [[SpaceX versus Boeing in commercial space missions | SpaceX's]] $2.6 billion, [[SpaceX versus Boeing in commercial space missions | SpaceX]] has since surpassed Boeing in crewed spaceflight, even planning the world's first private spacewalk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Beyond space, Boeing has faced significant [[challenges_faced_by_boeing_in_aerospace | criticism as an airline company]] due to failures involving its 737 MAX commercial airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **January 5, 2024:** An Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX experienced a mid-flight door plug blowout, leading to rapid decompression. Investigations revealed loose hardware, with bolts in the door needing additional tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Subsequent inspections found loose parts in many other Boeing aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **2018-2019:** Two fatal crashes involving Lion Air Flight 610 (Indonesia, 2018) and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (2019) killed all passengers and crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. The cause was traced to problematic software installed by Boeing that, in some cases, took control away from pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This led to a 20-month grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX planes for safety enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

The CEO of Boeing has announced his intention to step down by the end of 2024 amidst these ongoing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

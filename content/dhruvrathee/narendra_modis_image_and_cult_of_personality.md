From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

A significant aspect of [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Prime Minister Narendra Modi's image]] is the cultivation of a "Cult of Personality," which aims to portray him as an extraordinary, almost divine, leader despite various challenges and criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This image is reportedly fostered through emotional manipulation and brainwashing on a large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Pillars of the Cult of Personality

The promotion of Modi's cult of personality is described as operating through four departments:
1.  **Pride and Arrogance:** Instilling a sense of greatness in people based on their identity, such as being Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
2.  **Victimisation Narrative:** Highlighting a history of victimisation for ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  **Fear Mongering:** Creating a sense of danger and threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  **Messiah Portrayal:** Presenting [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]] as the sole saviour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

This article focuses on the fourth aspect: [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi's portrayal]] as a messiah and the resulting cult of personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Constructed Image of Humility

### "Tea Seller" Narrative

The story of [[Narendra Modis childhood and early life | Narendra Modi]] selling tea at Vadnagar railway station since the age of six has been a major talking point in his narrative of struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Modi himself has claimed to come from an extremely poor family, stating that poverty was his "first inspiration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

However, this claim has been questioned:
*   **Childhood Photos:** Photos from his childhood show him wearing suits, which is considered unusual for a child from an extremely poor family in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Family Home:** His old home, while not large, is questioned as looking like that of an "extremely poor" family during the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Brother's Statement:** His younger brother, Prahlad Modi, clarified that all five brothers helped their father, who sold tea his whole life, suggesting [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Narendra Modi]] should be called the "son of a tea seller," not a tea seller himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **"Canteen Contractor" Claim:** Congress leader Ahmad Patel claimed Modi was a canteen contractor, a claim BJP unintentionally acknowledged in 2021 when the Railways Minister instructed officials to beautify a canteen at Vadnagar railway station, stating it was run by Modi's father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Exaggerated Poverty:** Writer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, who wrote a biography on Modi, clarified that Modi's claims of poverty are "grossly exaggerated" and that his father had enough money to send all brothers to school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. School attendance would mean he couldn't work full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

The exaggeration of such stories is said to be a tactic to sell an idea to the Indian public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### "Holy Beggar" Image

[[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]] frequently claims to be a "faqir" (holy beggar) who will leave with only the bare minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He states he survived on charity for 35 or 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

This image is challenged by:
*   **Luxury Items:** Wearing sunglasses worth ₹140,000 and traveling in a ₹120 million Mercedes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   **Foreign Tours in the 1990s:** His ability to afford foreign tours to places like Paris, Washington D.C., Hollywood, London, and Malaysia in the 1990s, while claiming to live on charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Digital Camera Claim:** His assertion of using a digital camera in 1987-1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, despite the first commercially available digital camera being released in the US in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Frequent Outfit Changes:** Unlike former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who reportedly had only two sets of outfits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, PM Modi has been noted to change outfits multiple times a day during official visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Abandoning Family for the Nation

The narrative that [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]] is great because he "left his family for the nation" and "abandoned his wife" is promoted by pro-government media and WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Modi himself has repeatedly made this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

However, this is seen as problematic:
*   **Personal Choice vs. Achievement:** The act of a couple not wanting to live together is a personal matter and is questioned as being portrayed as an achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Historical Examples:** Figures like Lal Bahadur Shastri and Mahatma Jyotirao Phule (with his wife Savitribai Phule) made significant contributions to the nation without abandoning their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Anti-Woman Mentality:** This narrative is criticised as an "anti-woman mentality" that views women as a hindrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Lord Buddha:** While comparisons are made to Lord Buddha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, it is highlighted that Buddha left his home for enlightenment and later sought to thank his wife, Yashodhara, for her support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Buddha did not use his renunciation to insult others or gain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Distance from Family:** While Modi attends weddings of celebrities and oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, his own family members, like his brother Prahlad Modi and niece Sonal Modi, state they are instructed to stay away and were not invited to his oath ceremony as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Photos with his mother are noted to often include only Modi, his mother, and cameramen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Impact on Youth:** This narrative is seen as brainwashing Hindu youngsters into prioritising aggressive political actions over looking after their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

## Portrayal as God Incarnate

Political figures have repeatedly compared [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | PM Modi]] to God, calling him "God's gift to India," an "incarnation of God," or even "Lord Ram" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Temples dedicated to [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]] have also been built in places like Pune, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

This comparison is likened to Adolf H being compared to Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. The problem highlighted is that while figures like Lord Ram embody gentleness and empathy, Modi is perceived to spread hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. To reconcile this, there has been a shift in iconography towards "angry Hanuman" and "angry Ram" images, and the contortion of Hindu scriptures to insert messages of violence and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This manipulation of religion for a hate-filled agenda is criticised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

## Propaganda and Manipulation Tactics

### Demonizing Opponents

To present Modi as an omnipotent superhero, opponents like Rahul Gandhi are often portrayed as "incompetent fools" or "Pappu" through out-of-context and edited clips circulated by IT cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. This is contrasted with Modi's lack of press conferences or unscripted interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>, while Rahul Gandhi has given numerous lectures and unscripted interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

>[!info] Comparison of Public Speaking Styles
>While funny clips of Rahul Gandhi exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, similar instances of Modi making unusual statements are also noted, such as talking about making tea from gutter fumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, denying climate change by stating "heat tolerance is lowering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, or suggesting clouds could block radar signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

A challenge for a one-on-one debate between Rahul Gandhi and [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]] by former Supreme Court judges was accepted by Gandhi but not by Modi, which is seen as an indication of who is a more capable leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

### Ubiquitous Self-Promotion

A key tactic in Modi's cult of personality is the ubiquitous display of his face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. This includes:
*   Newspapers, radio, TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>
*   Facebook, petrol pump hoardings, roadside posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>
*   Millions spent on Google Ads and advertisements for every government scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>
*   His image on Covid vaccine certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>
*   Installation of selfie points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>

The government reportedly spent over ₹64.91 billion on advertisements over 8 years, including ₹7.1 million daily for print ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. This is coupled with pro-government news anchors constantly praising him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

## Perceived Decline of "Modi Magic"

Despite the efforts to build this personality cult, there are signs that the "Modi magic" is fading:
*   **Public Discontent:** People are reportedly fed up with seeing Modi's face everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Questions on Policies:** Questions arise regarding the lack of intervention in issues like the violence in Manipur, despite claims of stopping foreign wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Migration:** A record 225,000 people renounced Indian citizenship in 2022, indicating dissatisfaction with the country's state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.
*   **Recruitment of Corrupt Politicians:** The need for BJP to recruit politicians accused of large-scale corruption from other parties suggests that Modi's name alone is no longer sufficient to secure electoral victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Economic Disparities:** Critics point to the enrichment of PM Modi's allies like Gautam Adani, while 800 million poor people rely on free grains and suffer from unemployment and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The income inequality is stated to be the highest in 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Hiding Poverty:** Instances like building a wall to hide slums during the "Namaste Trump" event in Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> and hiding slums behind green screens during the G20 summit in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> are highlighted as examples of hiding poverty rather than eradicating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

The speaker concludes by urging people to vote against "hate and lies" to protect the country's democracy and Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

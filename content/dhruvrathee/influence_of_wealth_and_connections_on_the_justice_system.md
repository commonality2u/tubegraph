The Pune Porsche accident, which occurred on the night of May 18, 2024, brought to light significant concerns regarding the [[systemic_issues_in_law_enforcement_and_governance | systemic issues in law enforcement and governance]] in India, particularly the perceived influence of wealth and connections on the justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The case involved a minor from a wealthy family who allegedly caused the deaths of two individuals while driving under the influence of alcohol.

## The Accident

On the night of May 18, 2024, Aneesh and Ashwini, both 24-year-old IT professionals from Jabalpur, were returning home on a motorcycle in Pune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. At approximately 2:30 AM, their motorcycle took a U-turn on Kalyani Nagar Airport Road when it was struck by an electric Porsche Taycan, driven by a 17-year-old minor identified as Vedant Agarwal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The Porsche was reportedly traveling at speeds between 160 kmph and over 200 kmph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The collision resulted in the immediate deaths of Aneesh and Ashwini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Prior to the accident, Vedant, who is under 18 years old, had been drinking alcohol with 12 friends at a pub called Cosie, where they incurred a bill of ₹48,000 within 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Despite being underage, Vedant and two friends later moved to another club, Blak, before leaving in his Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The car did not have a number plate at the time of the accident because its permanent registration had been pending since March due to unpaid fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Initial Police Response and Influences

After the collision, Vedant was apprehended by bystanders and handed over to the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, events at the Yerwada police station quickly raised suspicions of external influence:

*   **Political Intervention:** MLA Sunil Tingre arrived at the police station at 3:00 AM, just one hour after the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Tingre stated he came to help because he had known Vedant's family for 30 years and considered them friends, having been called by Vedant's father, Vishal Agarwal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **"Feast" at the Police Station:** Reporters observed a man delivering 6-7 pizza cartons to the police station, suggesting a "feast" was held that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Controversial FIR Section:** The FIR against Vedant was filed under Section 304A (Death by Negligence), which carries a maximum punishment of 2 years, instead of Section 304 (Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder), which carries a maximum of 10 years imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The choice of Section 304A implies a lack of knowledge that one's actions could lead to death, despite the widespread understanding that drunk driving or speeding at 200 kmph on a small road can be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This discrepancy raised questions about whether MLA Sunil Tingre influenced the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Blood Sample Tampering

Further allegations of corruption emerged regarding Vedant's blood test:
*   **Delayed Test:** The blood test was conducted at 11:00 AM, approximately 8 hours after the incident, raising concerns as alcohol can remain in the bloodstream for 6 to 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Sample Replacement:** Despite the delay, the test result was negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Investigations revealed that the real blood sample was disposed of and replaced with a clean sample by two doctors, Dr. Ajay Taware and Dr. Shrihari Halnor, who were allegedly bribed ₹300,000 by the Agarwal family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Both doctors have since been arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Attempts to Shift Blame

Further attempts were made by the Agarwal family to manipulate the investigation:
*   Vedant's mother allegedly requested their driver to take the blame for the crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Vedant's grandfather threatened and forced the driver to admit he was driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Fortunately, these attempts failed due to the presence of numerous witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Juvenile Justice Board's Decision and Public Outcry

The most controversial development was the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) granting bail to Vedant within 15 hours of his detention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The conditions for bail were remarkably lenient: Vedant was required to study traffic rules, prepare a presentation, and write a 300-word essay on road accidents and their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

This decision triggered widespread [[public_outrage_and_social_medias_role_in_seeking_justice | public outrage and social media's role in seeking justice]] across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. People questioned if justice was reduced to a joke for the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The pressure led the police to appeal to the Sessions Court on May 20, requesting Vedant be tried as an adult and the charge be changed to Section 304 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

The police also expanded their investigation, booking the owners and managers of Club Cosie and Blak for serving alcohol to a minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, a judge's statement during a remand application, questioning what people would do if they couldn't drive after visiting pubs, was perceived as an attempt to shift blame from Vedant to the pub owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

Under continued public pressure, an FIR was lodged against Vedant's father, Vishal Agarwal, under Section 75 (willful neglect or exposing a child to harm) and Section 77 (supplying intoxicating liquor to a child) of the Juvenile Justice Act, along with sections of the Motor Vehicles Act for allowing Vedant to drive without a license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Vishal Agarwal attempted to flee but was arrested in Aurangabad on May 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Vedant was subsequently remanded to an observation home until June 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## Legal Technicalities and Systemic Issues

The case highlighted a legal technicality within the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. While the Act allows for 16-18 year olds to be tried as adults for "heinous crimes" (crimes with a minimum imprisonment of 7 years), Section 304 of the IPC, despite having a maximum sentence of 10 years, does not specify a minimum sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This loophole means such offenses often do not fall under the "heinous crime" category, allowing minors to evade stricter adult trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

This technicality has been observed in previous cases, such as:
*   **2016 Delhi Case:** A repeat offender, 4 days shy of his 18th birthday, ran over a 32-year-old man. Despite initial attempts by the JJB to try him as an adult, the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that Section 304 was not technically a heinous crime, requiring him to be tried as a minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **2023 Kanpur Case:** A 15-year-old boy killed two people in October 2023 but easily obtained bail.

Critics argue that for minors from privileged backgrounds, such as Vedant, who received a good education and all privileges, including a Porsche at 17, the concept of "Doli Incapax" (age of criminal responsibility) should not apply as it does to children from disadvantaged environments who might commit crimes due to poor parenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Power of Public Unity

The Pune case has served as a stark example of how wealth can be used to manipulate the justice system, allowing rich individuals to bypass rules and consequences that common citizens face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. However, the widespread [[public_outrage_and_social_medias_role_in_seeking_justice | public outrage and social media's role in seeking justice]] has played a crucial role in pushing authorities to take stricter actions, leading to arrests of those involved in corruption and attempts to ensure justice for the victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

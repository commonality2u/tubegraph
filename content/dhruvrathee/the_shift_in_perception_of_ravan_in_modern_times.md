From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

Traditionally, the story of Valmiki's [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayan]] is understood as a straightforward narrative where [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Lord Ram]], accompanied by his wife Sita and brother Lakshman, goes into exile for 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. During this period, Sita is kidnapped by the demon lord [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. After [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] declines requests to free Sita, a war ensues, culminating in the triumph of good over evil and [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]'s defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This victory is celebrated annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. However, contemporary discourse, particularly on social media, challenges this simple narrative of "Hero [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Ram]] versus Villain [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## [[temples_and_worship_of_ravan_in_india | Worship]] of [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]

Contrary to the common perception of [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] as purely evil, there are [[temples_and_worship_of_ravan_in_india | temples]] in India where he is worshipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Examples include:
*   A temple in Madhya Pradesh's Ravangaon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   The Dashanan [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] temple in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   A temple in Greater Noida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   [[temples_and_worship_of_ravan_in_india | Temples]] in Rajasthan's Jodhpur and Andhra Pradesh, where devotees chant "Jai Lankesh" and "Jai [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] Baba" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Online, poems with millions of views express admiration for [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]], with lines such as: "Let the world emulate [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Ram]], I like being [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Justifications and Sympathy for [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]

There has been a recent shift across the [[modi_governments_impact_on_indias_cultural_and_historical_perception | political spectrum]], with both left-wing and right-wing individuals developing a "soft corner" for [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. People offer justifications for his actions, suggesting he may not be as villainous as commonly believed, and some show sympathy for him and his brother Kumbhkaran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Arguments in Favour of [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] and Counterarguments

Several arguments are made in favour of [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]], which are often countered by emphasizing his actions over his attributes.

#### [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] as a Scholar and Devotee
Proponents highlight [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]'s positive qualities, such as being a scholar of the Vedas and holy scriptures, a master of the Veena, devoted to Lord Shiva, and a Brahmin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
However, this argument is countered by examples like Adolf Hitler, a skilled painter, and Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, an intelligent and multi-lingual terrorist who attended the London School of Economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The point is that talent or intellectual prowess does not nullify criminal actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Despite his positive attributes, [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] committed the crime of kidnapping Sita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Furthermore, he was responsible for Marich's death and mercilessly killed Jatayu who tried to help Sita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

#### [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] as an Administrator
Some argue that [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] was a brilliant administrator who ruled his kingdom well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
However, Valmiki's [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayan]] does not support this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. In fact, his sister Surpanakha, in Aranyakaand, chapter 33, criticizes him as addicted to vulgar pleasures, unguided, lustful, greedy, inattentive to his people, unable to protect his country, surrounded by ordinary ministers, harsh, arrogant, intoxicated, short-tempered, evil-minded, and lacking good qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Valmiki notes that [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] pondered these criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

#### The Surpanakha Incident
It is often claimed that [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] kidnapped Sita to avenge his sister Surpanakha, whose nose and ears were cut off by Lakshman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
Valmiki's [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayan]] (Aranyakand, Chapters 17 and 18) presents a different account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Surpanakha first proposed marriage to [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Ram]], insulted Sita as ugly, deformed, and disfigured, and threatened to eat Sita and Lakshman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. After being redirected to Lakshman and then back to [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Ram]], she attempted to kill Sita, at which point Lakshman cut off her nose and ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Furthermore, when Surpanakha recounted the incident to [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]], she did not ask for revenge but rather described Sita's beauty and urged [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] to kidnap her for himself after killing [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Ram]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This conversation does not indicate an intention of revenge on [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]'s part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

#### Treatment of Sita
Some assert that despite kidnapping Sita, [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] treated her with dignity and respect, never forcing himself upon her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
However, details in Aranya Kaand (chapters 49-52) and Sundarkand 22:8 and 22:9 reveal that [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] threatened Sita, giving her a two-month deadline to agree to be his wife, or she would be cooked for his breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This behavior is not considered respectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]'s Other Atrocities

The [[the_addition_of_uttar_kand_to_the_original_ramayana | Uttarkand]], an epilogue to the [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayan]] (though some scholars believe it to be a [[misinterpretations_and_later_additions_to_the_Ramayana | later addition]] not part of the original text) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, further details [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]'s wrongdoings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>:
*   He attacked his half-brother Kuber, stealing Lanka and the Pushpak Viman (flying chariot) from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] killed a peace messenger sent by Kuber, and demons consumed the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   He went to where King Marut was performing holy rites, killed monks, and drank their blood (Uttarkand 18:20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
These accounts portray [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] as a demonic murderer, robber, and cannibal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] as a Symbol of Evil

Despite his intelligence, scholarship, or devotion, [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] is depicted as a symbol of evil because of his numerous wicked deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Even his brother Kumbhkaran acknowledged [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]'s wrongdoings and predicted his downfall (Yudhkand, chapter 63) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The key [[metaphorical_and_literal_interpretations_of_the_Ramayana | interpretation]] is that even a scholar, Shiv devotee, and Brahmin can be a [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Loyalty vs. Right: The Case of Vibhishan

While [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] gains sympathy, his third brother Vibhishan often receives hate, being labeled a "traitor" or "anti-national" for siding with [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Ram]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
However, supporting a brother who commits a crime makes one a partner in that crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Vibhishan's decision to align with the path of right over family loyalty is analogous to modern examples like a policeman arresting his gangster brother, or a mother reporting her son's violent plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Such actions, though seen as disloyal, are often lauded as heroic when they prevent greater harm or uphold truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Vibhishan's choice represents being a nonconformist who prioritizes good over evil, aligning with the idea that loyalty should not override the distinction between right and wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Misconception about [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]'s Secret
A common belief is that Vibhishan revealed [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]'s secret, the "pot of elixir" in his stomach, which [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Ram]] then targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. However, Valmiki's [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayan]] contains no mention of such an elixir; this was a [[misinterpretations_and_later_additions_to_the_Ramayana | later addition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. In Valmiki's text, [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]'s death occurs when [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Ram]] shoots a special arrow into his heart (Yudhkand 108:16 and 108:17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

Ultimately, Lanka's destruction was attributed to [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] and Kumbhkaran's evil deeds, not Vibhishan's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

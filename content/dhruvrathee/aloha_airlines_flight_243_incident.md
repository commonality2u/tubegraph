On April 28, 1988, around 1:00 PM, Aloha Airlines Flight 243 was preparing for take-off in Hawaii on a routine 35-minute flight from Hilo to Honolulu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Hawaii is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, part of America, known for its beautiful islands with Honolulu as its capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Aloha Airlines is a local Hawaiian airline that connects the various islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Due to short distances, this particular Boeing 737 plane had already completed eight flights, including three round trips, since that morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The flight took off at exactly 1:25 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Pre-flight Observation
Before boarding, a passenger noticed a small crack on one of the riveted sheets forming the plane's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. She did not report it, assuming it was inconsequential given the airline's reputation and regular inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Mid-Flight Catastrophe
Approximately 20 minutes after take-off, as the flight reached its cruising altitude of 24,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, a loud blast occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This was followed by a sudden rapid decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, causing chaos with objects flying around and passengers struggling to breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Passengers discovered that about 35 m² of the plane's front body, including the roof and surrounding walls, had disintegrated and blown away, exposing them to the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Aviation cabins are typically pressurized to allow normal breathing at high altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. In an emergency, oxygen masks usually drop to provide 15-20 minutes of oxygen, giving pilots time to descend to an altitude below 10,000 feet where normal breathing is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, on Flight 243, the oxygen mask system was completely destroyed due to the roof blowing away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This immediately raised concerns about hypoxia (insufficient oxygen), which can lead to unconsciousness and death within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Passengers also faced extreme conditions: winds as fast as 500 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a> and temperatures of -45°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Most passengers were dressed for Hawaii's tropical climate (shorts and t-shirts) and were unprepared for such cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Crew Response
Three air hostesses were on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>:
*   Michelle Honda (near Row 15) attempted to contact the cockpit via intercom but received no response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. She later crawled to the cockpit, finding her colleague Jane Sato bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. She also asked passengers if anyone knew how to fly a plane, alarming them further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   C.B. Lansing (near Row 5) was serving a drink when the roof blew off, and she was sucked out of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   Jane Sato (near Row 2) fell to the floor after being hit by flying luggage and suffered a concussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Fortunately, the pilots were alive and in better condition than the passengers, as their oxygen masks were working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Captain Robert Schornstheimer (44, 11 years with Aloha Airlines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> and First Officer Mimi Tompkins (36) were in command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Upon realizing the plane's roof and cockpit door were missing, they immediately put on their masks and initiated an emergency descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. They descended at 4,100 feet per minute while maintaining a speed of 500 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Perilous Descent and Landing
A critical issue was that the plane's nose, including the cockpit, was drooping by about one meter, with only the floor connecting it to the cabin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. There was a risk of the two parts breaking apart if they flew for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Mimi Tompkins contacted Honolulu ATC, who advised them to land in Maui, which was closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. At 1:48 PM, three minutes after the explosion, the plane was at 14,000 feet, easing breathing difficulties for most passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. She requested all emergency services be prepared at Maui Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Another challenge arose as the plane descended to 10,000 feet: a 10,000-foot mountain, the Haleakala Summit, stood between the plane and Maui Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Captain Schornstheimer skillfully slowed the plane to 170 knots, maneuvering it between two islands to evade the mountain and turn towards the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

As the plane approached the runway, Mimi Tompkins deployed the landing gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. While the main gear (rear wheels) successfully released, the nose gear (front wheels) did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. A "belly landing" without the nose gear is possible but was deemed too risky given the plane's severely weakened middle section and missing roof, which could lead to a crash, fuel tank rupture, and explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Despite the dangers, the pilots decided to attempt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

A new problem emerged as the plane descended further: the left engine failed, causing the plane to move side to side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Attempts to manually restart it were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

At 1:56 PM, the pilots informed Maui Tower of their need for all airport equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Just minutes before landing, a ground observer with binoculars confirmed that the nose gear had successfully deployed, removing the need for a belly landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

At 1:58 PM, precisely 13 minutes and 42 seconds after the explosion, Aloha Airlines Flight 243 touched down safely on the runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The pilots used brakes and the remaining engine's thrust reverser to bring the plane to a halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Aftermath and Casualties
Emergency teams, including firefighters and ambulances, were on standby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Passengers deboarded through emergency exits, and many applauded the captain for saving their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

While most were safe, many sustained serious injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>:
*   An 84-year-old female passenger in seat 5A suffered a skull fracture and severe injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   A passenger in 6A had a broken hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   Passengers in Rows 4 to 7 were generally seriously injured, as this was the area where the roof blew apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   Passengers in Rows 8 to 21 had minor injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   21 passengers were uninjured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   Air hostess Jane Sato suffered only a concussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   Air hostess Michelle Honda was safe and confirmed all passengers were accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

Tragically, 58-year-old air hostess C.B. Lansing was the sole fatality, having been sucked out of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Her body was never recovered, disappearing into the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. The remaining 94 people survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

The high survival rate was largely attributed to passengers wearing seatbelts, as the seatbelt sign had remained on due to the flight not yet reaching cruising altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## [[Investigation of airplane accidents | Investigation and Findings]]
Following the incident, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an [[investigation_of_airplane_accidents | investigation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. They found that the plane had completed 89,680 flight cycles and 35,496 flight hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

The main cause was fatigue and corrosion of the fuselage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. The plane's metal sheets constantly expanded due to cabin pressurization during flight and contracted on the ground, weakening the structure over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

The Boeing 737 fuselage uses overlapping aluminum sheet metal panels, known as Lap Joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. To allow the thin 1mm skin to absorb stress, Boeing developed a bonding process using strong epoxy glue to join these parts, reinforced by three rows of rivets on every overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

However, problems with this method emerged: high moisture content weakened the epoxy glue, leading to its degradation and metal corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This shifted the stress onto the rivets instead of the glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. In 1972, Boeing switched to a new "Hot Bonding" method, using heat and pressure to join sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

The NTSB's final report identified three main contributing factors:
1.  **Aloha Airlines Management**: Failed to properly supervise its maintenance program and assess inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Aloha Airlines claimed to have used the Eddy Current technique (which passes electric current through metal to detect small, invisible cracks) to find cracks, but was later found to have lied and not properly inspected their planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
2.  **US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)**: Did not mandate a thorough inspection of lap joints when issuing Airworthiness Directives, despite Boeing's recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.
3.  **Boeing and FAA's Underestimation**: Both took the issues with the old bonding technique too lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Boeing had designed the 737 to fly for 20 years, or up to 51,000 flight hours and 75,000 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Although Flight 243 had fewer flight hours, its use for short-distance trips resulted in nearly 90,000 flight cycles, exceeding Boeing's recommended 75,000 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

Boeing had issued a service bulletin in 1972 and an Alert Service Bulletin in 1987 (one year before the incident) advising inspections and repairs for older planes still in use due to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Additionally, Boeing's Safety Design included "Tear Straps" every 25 cm to limit any tear in the fuselage to a 10x10 inch square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. However, Flight 243 had so many cracks that these straps were ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. The NTSB concluded that at cruising altitude, peak pressure caused the numerous individual cracks to converge, blowing off a large section of the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## [[Aviation safety improvements post1996 | Safety Improvements]]
This incident led to significant [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | improvements]] in [[aviation_safety_procedures_and_regulations | aviation safety procedures and regulations]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
*   All of Boeing's older airplanes were re-inspected, revealing similar cracks to Flight 243 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   In 1991, the Federal Aviation Authority launched its Aging Aircraft Safety Program, mandating inspections and control programs for all old aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   Aircraft maintenance techniques for detecting cracks changed permanently, now relying on non-human-eye methods like Eddy Current and ultrasonic testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   New rules were implemented for high-cycle planes (those completing many short-duration flights daily), requiring more frequent inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   The American government passed the Aviation Safety Research Act of 1988 to better understand and plan for aging aircraft issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

This single incident profoundly changed aviation safety standards, thankfully preventing similar occurrences since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

The Titan submersible, operated by OceanGate, relied on specific communication and control systems during its deep-sea expeditions to the [[titan_submersible_mission_to_titanic_wreck | Titanic wreck]].

## Support Ship and Communication Protocols
The Titan submersible required a support ship, the Polar Prince, to launch into and return from the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This support ship remained on the surface, controlling the overall operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The submersible communicated with the Polar Prince every 15 minutes by sending a signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, and this was their only communication channel with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

During its final dive on June 18, 2023, the Titan lost contact with its support ship approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes into its descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Communication ceased at 11:15 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. At the extreme depths where the Titan operated, GPS systems do not function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Communication with the support ship was primarily carried out through a text messaging system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. OceanGate had previously stated they used Starlink's satellite internet service for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Submersible Operation and Internal Systems
The Titan was equipped with four electric thrusters on the exterior: two horizontal and two vertical, which facilitated its operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

A notable feature of the Titan's control system was its use of a modified video game controller to operate the submersible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While this might seem unusual, the US Navy also uses Xbox controllers for some of its submarine functions, such as controlling periscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. However, in the Titan, the entire submersible was controlled by this single game controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Inside the submersible, there were no seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, but a small toilet was located beside the viewport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. There was no privacy barrier for the toilet, requiring other passengers to look away or at a TV screen when it was in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

A critical design aspect was the submersible's door, which could only be locked and opened from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This meant that even if the Titan had resurfaced, the occupants could not have exited without external assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### Emergency Resurfacing
The Titan had a mechanism to return to the surface in case it became stuck. Passengers could tilt the submersible from the inside and use a "push back and forth" motion to facilitate its ascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This was achieved by releasing ballasts, which are heavyweights used for stability and descent in ships and submarines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Traditionally, ballasts were stones or sandbags, but modern submarines use water ballasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Despite these measures, the Titan did not resurface as scheduled at 4:30 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The US Coast Guard was notified at 7:10 PM, initiating a large-scale multinational search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. An emergency locator, known as an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB), typically installed on vessels to aid location, was not installed in the Titan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

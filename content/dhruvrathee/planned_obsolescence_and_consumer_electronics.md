Companies employ various strategies to manipulate consumers into repeated purchases, often by intentionally limiting the lifespan or functionality of products. This includes practices like [[price_discrimination_based_on_device | price discrimination]] and the intentional design of products to fail, a concept known as [[Planned obsolescence and consumer electronics | Planned Obsolescence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Price Discrimination and Dynamic Pricing

Some companies charge different prices based on the device or even the battery level of a consumer's phone.
*   In January 2025, Zepto's Android app sold 1 kg onions for ₹43, while on an iPhone, they were ₹57 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Similarly, 500 grams of grapes were ₹146 on iPhone and ₹65 on Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Green bell peppers on Zepto were ₹21 on Android phones and ₹107 on iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   Cab booking apps have been accused of increasing prices when a phone's battery is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. A 2023 Belgian newspaper study found Uber charged more on a phone with 12% battery compared to one with 84% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Uber's Head of Economic Research, Keith Chen, stated in a 2016 NPR interview that Uber identified people are willing to pay more if their phone's battery is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, and their app can check battery levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Rishabh Singh of the Engineer Hub conducted an experiment in January 2025 finding Uber charged more for low-battery devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   Subscription fees can also vary by device; YouTube Premium costs ₹195 on iPhone but ₹149 on Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Twitter's Premium Plus subscription is ₹2,299/month on iPhone and ₹2,150 on Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>.
*   E-commerce companies like Flipkart have also been accused of [[price_discrimination_based_on_device | price discrimination]], with a suitcase costing ₹4,119 on Android and ₹4,799 on iOS in December 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Planned Obsolescence

[[Planned obsolescence and consumer electronics | Planned Obsolescence]] is a strategy where companies intentionally design products to become obsolete or non-functional after a certain period, forcing consumers to buy new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This is done even when the technology exists to make more durable products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

### Examples in Consumer Electronics

*   **Smartphones**:
    *   Smartphone batteries typically last 3-4 years before their performance degrades significantly, compelling users to purchase new phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
    *   Manufacturers deliberately seal batteries, making them non-replaceable, despite the technological feasibility of easy replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
    *   Apple has been accused of intentionally slowing down iPhones with software updates to encourage new purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
        *   In 2018, Italy's Competition Authority fined Apple €10 million and Samsung €5 million after finding that software updates worsened smartphone performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
        *   In 2020, Apple was fined €25 million in France for slowing older phones without informing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
        *   Apple acknowledged that older iPhone models slow down, attributing it to battery degradation and preventing unexpected shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, but questions remain why replaceable batteries aren't offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
        *   Apple was ordered to pay $500 million to customers in America due to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Other Electronic Appliances**: The lifespan of many electronic appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines, and microwave ovens, is often 5-7 years, and sometimes as little as 3-4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. This contrasts with older appliances that lasted much longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Companies deliberately use cheap materials and designs to make products break easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### The [[Razor and blade business model | Razor and Blade Model]]

This [[razor_and_blade_business_model | business model]] involves selling a main product cheaply to create dependency, with the primary profit coming from expensive, repeatedly purchased side products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

*   **Printers**: Printers are often sold at a loss to generate profit from expensive ink cartridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.
    *   Printers are designed to be compatible only with their specific company's ink cartridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
    *   Companies embed microchips in printers and issue regular firmware updates to prevent the use of third-party ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. In 2018, nine printer companies sent approximately 900 such updates, almost three daily, to check for third-party ink use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.
    *   If third-party ink is detected, the printer may stop working or its warranty might lapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.
    *   The cost of producing one liter of ink is around $20-$40, but it is sold for exorbitant prices, such as $12,000 for 3.7 liters (1 gallon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. This makes printer ink more expensive than human blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
    *   Companies justify high prices by citing research and development costs, but it is primarily a tactic to increase earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.
    *   [[Shrinkflation_in_product_packaging | Shrinkflation]] also affects ink cartridges, with the quantity of ink decreasing over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
    *   HP has faced legal issues in Australia and Europe, paying compensation for printer issues related to ink compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Epson was also sued in the US for printers stopping when third-party ink was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.
*   **Water Purifiers**: Water purifier companies use a similar strategy by requiring annual servicing and filter changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. Expensive parts like the RO membrane and filters, costing ₹4,000-₹6,000, are often not covered by the Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Planned Obsolescence

*   **Increased Consumption**: The constant launch of new products, often with minimal innovation, drives higher consumption levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>.
*   **Environmental Impact**: This leads to increased mining of elements like gold, cobalt, and lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>, and significant carbon emissions throughout the product lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. In 2020, smartphones alone caused 580 million tonnes of CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.
*   **E-waste Generation**: Planned obsolescence contributes significantly to e-waste, with smartphones accounting for 10% of the world's e-waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>.

## Regulatory and Consumer Actions

*   **Right to Repair Rules**: In 2021, the European Union introduced "Right to Repair Rules" requiring companies to carry replacement parts for products for at least 10 years and ensure products are easily repairable using common, universal parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. This law led Apple to adopt USB-C chargers for iPhones starting with iPhone 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   **Consumer Awareness**: Consumers need to be more aware of these tactics and vocal about their concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. Speaking out against injustice by tagging companies on social media, emailing, and creating awareness videos can put pressure on them to take corrective actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.
*   **Government Regulations**: Governments must implement strict regulations and take action against companies that engage in deceptive practices, similar to those in developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.
*   **Supporting Ethical Companies**: Supporting companies that prioritize innovation, transparency, and consumer benefit, such as Urban Company's Native RO with its 2-year filter life and unconditional warranty, encourages positive change in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. This fosters competition that challenges predatory business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

The [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | United States]] initially maintained a policy of non-involvement in World War II, watching events unfold in Europe from afar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The country had opted to stay out of the conflict, having experienced World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### Entry into World War II

The [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | United States]] officially entered [[Causes of World War II | World War II]] following a surprise attack by Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

*   **Pearl Harbor Attack** On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor without provocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This attack resulted in the death of over 2,300 American troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The bombing of Pearl Harbor prompted the [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | United States]] to officially declare war against Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Joining the Allies** After declaring war, the [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | United States]] joined the Allied Forces, which included major countries like the UK, the [[Impact of the Soviet Union in WWII | Soviet Union]], and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | United States]] spent several months preparing for the war before fully engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Key Contributions and Campaigns

The involvement of the [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | United States]] significantly altered the dynamics of the war, particularly through its military campaigns.

*   **Battle of Midway** In June 1942, the [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | American]] forces attacked Japanese territories in the South Pacific, known as the Battle of Midway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This battle resulted in the destruction of four important Japanese aircraft and supplier carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **D-Day (Normandy Landings)** On June 6, 1944, known as D-Day, over 150,000 British, [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | American]], and Canadian soldiers landed on Normandy beaches in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This terrifying operation aimed to fight the German army on land and liberate France, marking the first time the British army was on the ground fighting German forces since the Dunkirk evacuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The Allied Forces also landed in Southern France, contributing to the liberation of countries from Hitler's army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Tehran and Yalta Conferences** The [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | US]] played a role in strategic planning, with President Roosevelt meeting with Stalin and Churchill in Tehran in November 1943 to discuss how to end WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference was held in Crimea, where it was announced that any country declaring war on Germany could join the Allied forces in attacking Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   **Atomic Bombs on Japan** Despite Germany's surrender in May 1945, World War II was not over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Japan took another two months to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. After Japan ignored an ultimatum to surrender in July 1945, the [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | United States]] dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. (The story behind this decision is elaborated in discussions on [[us_perspective_and_decision_behind_using_nuclear_weapons | Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the [[reasons_for_japans_involvement_in_world_war_ii | reasons for Japan's involvement in WWII]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Post-War Impact

The [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | United States]] played a significant role in shaping the post-war world order.

*   **United Nations** The United Nations was established in October 1945 to prevent future World Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. The permanent members of the United Nations were largely the countries that constituted the Allied Forces in WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   **Global Economic Institutions** The framework for institutions such as the World Bank, IMF, and NATO were also set up after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. These institutions contributed to the [[impact_on_usa_and_global_security_measures | global security measures]] and international cooperation that followed World War II.

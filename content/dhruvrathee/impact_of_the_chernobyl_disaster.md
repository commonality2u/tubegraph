On April 26, 1986, at 1:23 AM, Reactor Number 4 of the [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in the [[impact_of_the_soviet_union_in_wwii | Soviet Union]] experienced a catastrophic explosion, releasing harmful radioactive material into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This event is still recognized as the world's worst nuclear disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The amount of radioactive material released was equivalent to 400 [[the_impact_of_atomic_bombings_on_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | Hiroshima atomic bombs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath & Initial Response

Immediately after the blast, the reactor was engulfed in flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Two people were instantly killed in the explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. The explosion blew the 1,000-tonne lid off the reactor structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Over 100 radioactive elements and 5% of the 192 tonnes of Uranium fuel went into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

Fire alarms began ringing at 1:26 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Firefighters, initially unaware of the true nature of the disaster, attempted to extinguish the graphite fire with water, but it took over 10 days to put out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Helicopters were used to drop thousands of tonnes of clay, sand, Boron, and lead from the sky to reduce radiation spread, a dangerous task that led to one helicopter crash, killing four people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

### Preventing a Third Explosion

After the fire was extinguished, the reactor continued to produce high levels of heat, causing the base to crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Beneath the reactor was a tank of radioactive water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. If the melting reactor came into contact with this water, it would instantly convert to steam, causing a potentially massive third explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. This blast could have killed millions of people and rendered almost all of Europe uninhabitable for 500,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

To prevent this, three divers (Boris Baranov, Alexei Ananenko, and Valeri Bezpalov) voluntarily entered the radioactive water tank on May 4, 1986, wearing simple diving equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. They successfully located and opened the valves to drain the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. All three divers survived; Boris passed away in 2005 from a heart attack, while Alexei and Valeri are still alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Environmental Impact

The radiation spread not only across Ukraine but throughout Europe, from Spain to Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Radioactive rain fell in the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The radioactive dust settled on grass, which was then consumed by cows, leading to a spike in radiation levels in their milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Around the plant, trees developed a red ginger tint, leading the area to be called the Red Forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. The 30 km radius around the plant became an exclusion zone by May 2, 1986, restricted to scientists and government officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

Despite the high radiation levels, the area has been largely reclaimed by nature due to the lack of human presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Large animals like wolves, deers, lynx, beavers, eagles, boars, and bears thrive there, some of which are endangered but have thriving populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. While some animals show deformities due to radiation, the overall impact on animal populations is not considered major <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

## Health Impacts

Firefighters who responded to the scene experienced fatigue and nausea upon returning home, symptoms of Radiation Sickness, indicating they would die within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Around 28 firefighters died within a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Those exposed to less radiation died within a couple of years, and others developed diseases like cancer within 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

The United Nations Scientific Community reported in 2018 that 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer were observed in children under 18 who lived through the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. This was mainly attributed to radioactive dust settling on pastures, leading to high levels of Iodine-131 in cow's milk, which is absorbed by the thyroid gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

## Economic Costs

The disaster cost the [[impact_of_the_soviet_union_in_wwii | Soviet Union]] an estimated $235 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. This included expenses for emergency response, cleanup, relocating people, survivor support, evacuations, and environmental decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

## Political Implications

The [[cold_war_impact_on_space_race | Cold War]] was underway at the time, and the [[impact_of_the_soviet_union_in_wwii | Soviet Union]] initially tried to cover up the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. However, when Swedish monitoring stations detected unreasonably high radioactivity levels and determined the source, the Soviet authorities were forced to publicly admit the disaster on April 28, 1986, two days after the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Local residents were informed even later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This cover-up is cited as a major reason for the breakdown of the [[impact_of_the_soviet_union_in_wwii | Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

## Safety Improvements & Lessons Learned

The [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl disaster]] spurred global research into preventing future nuclear disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. As a direct result, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was founded in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. WANO's aim is to conduct safety checks and research to improve safety at nuclear power plants worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

A key design flaw in the RBMK 1000 reactors (like Chernobyl's) was the use of graphite tips on control rods, which temporarily sped up the reaction upon insertion before the boron part could slow it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Additionally, the design resulted in a positive feedback loop where decreasing water (coolant) increased the reaction speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Modern nuclear reactors now use water as both coolant and moderator to create a negative feedback loop, preventing such uncontrolled acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

## Containing the Reactor

To contain the radioactive waste, a structure known as the Sarcophagus was built over Reactor 4, completed by November 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. This concrete and metal structure was not designed for the long term, and by 2008, rust and cracks began to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Therefore, in 2010, construction began on the New Safe Confinement, a $3 billion structure completed in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. It is expected to keep the reactor sealed for the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

## Current State of the Exclusion Zone

Despite the radiation, the remaining parts of the [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] continued to operate until 2000 to meet Ukraine's power needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. The dismantling process, begun thereafter, is expected to finish by 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. Approximately 2,400 people still work at the plant as guards, firefighters, scientists, technicians, or service staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Due to high radiation levels, they work only two shifts a week and are regularly monitored for absorbed radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

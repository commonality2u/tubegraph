A new figure, Bageshwar Baba, has recently gained prominence in the public sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He is purported to miraculously understand and resolve the problems of his followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. His rising popularity has been attributed, in part, to an added [[religious_and_castebased_tensions_in_india | Hindu-Muslim]] angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Satirist Rofl Gandhi pointed out that the fraud employed by Bageshwar Baba is similar to methods used by Christian and Muslim [[fraudulent_spiritual_leaders_in_india | conmen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The phenomenon of people willingly being deceived by [[fraudulent_spiritual_leaders_in_india | conmen]] is not limited to any single religion; individuals from all faiths are united in their susceptibility to superstitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Background of Bageshwar Baba (Dhirendra Shastri)

Bageshwar Baba's persona is embodied by Dhirendra Shastri, a 26-year-old from a village in Madhya Pradesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. According to a Dainik Jagran report, his real name is Dhirendra Krishna Garg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He operates an ashram known as Bageshwar Dham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Controversial Statements and Actions
Dhirendra Shastri first gained public attention for his [[religious_and_castebased_tensions_in_india | communal insightful speeches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   In April 2022, while preaching in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, he urged Hindus to unite and have bulldozers run over the homes of "stone-pelters," a clear political reference to actions in Uttar Pradesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. He also called for Hindus to take up arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This was described as a [[religious_and_castebased_tensions_in_india | communal speech]] aimed at disrupting public peace, though no arrests were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   He later declared himself a "Dhaba," implying he would continue making such hateful speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   Dhirendra also faced accusations of practicing [[religious_and_castebased_tensions_in_india | untouchability]], captured in a video where he reacted differently to a person attempting to touch his feet compared to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## The Nagpur Challenge

Dhirendra Shastri was recently in Nagpur for a Ram Katha, where he continued to claim mind-reading abilities and offer miraculous solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Shyam Manav and the Anti-Superstition Movement
Shyam Manav, National Convenor of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, entered the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This organization, founded in the 1980s by Narendra Dabholkar, combats superstitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Narendra Dabholkar was murdered in 2013 by fanatics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Following his death, Maharashtra passed a law against human sacrifices, superstitions, and black magic in December 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Shyam Manav, who identifies as a Sanatani Hindu akin to Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, opposes fraud committed in the name of religion, operating within the Indian Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. He has reportedly exposed over 200 [[fraudulent_spiritual_leaders_in_india | fraudulent spiritual leaders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   His notable cases include challenging Shakuntala Devi (known as the Human Computer) when she ventured into astrology and future predictions, leading to an FIR and her fleeing an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   He also took action against foreign missionaries in Nagpur who claimed to perform miracles like restoring sight and hearing, leading to the arrest of four missionaries under the 1986 Drugs and Remedies Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### The Challenge and Its Aftermath
Upon learning that Dhirendra Shastri was holding a "Divya Darbar" in Nagpur (scheduled for January 7th and 8th) where he claimed to perform miracles, Shyam Manav investigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. He reported illegalities to the police, but no action was taken, and Nagpur police later gave Bageshwar Baba a clean chit, stating no evidence against the Black Magic Act was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Shyam Manav publicly challenged Dhirendra Shastri with two tests for a reward of â‚¹3 million:
1.  Identify 10 people in a room by name, father's name, age, and phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
2.  Predict 10 items kept in an adjacent room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
Shyam Manav pledged to apologize, bow to the Baba, and disband his organization if Bageshwar Baba achieved 90% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

However, Dhirendra Shastri left Nagpur on January 11th, despite the event poster indicating it would last until January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Shyam Manav branded him a "deserter" for not accepting the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This led to Hindutva organizations burning Shyam Manav's effigies and issuing death threats, referencing Narendra Dabholkar's murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Shyam Manav has since received security cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Dhirendra's cousin, Lokesh Garg, claimed they also received death threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Dhirendra Shastri stated he did not flee, asserting the Ram Katha was always scheduled until January 11th, and invited Shyam Manav to challenge him in Raipur or Bageshwar Dham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Shyam Manav responded that Nagpur is the only suitable location for the challenge due to Maharashtra's strong law and order and the cordial relations between Baba and Maharashtra Home Minister Devendra Fadnavis, which would prevent any "shenanigans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Critiques and Broader Context

### Calls for Accountability
Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand challenged those claiming miracles to address real societal problems like the sinking land in Joshimath, forced religious conversions, suicides, disputes, and domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. It is suggested that Dhirendra Shastri, with his alleged abilities, could assist in national security (RAW), crime-solving (police), and even curing diseases like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Global Perspective on Supernatural Claims
The practices of Bageshwar Baba are considered fraudulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Renowned magician James Randi, who used his tricks for entertainment, established the James Randi Foundation to promote scientific temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. He offered a $1 million paranormal challenge to anyone who could prove the existence of supernatural entities, a challenge that remains unclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

### The Problem of Fraudulent Spiritual Leaders
The issue of [[fraudulent_spiritual_leaders_in_india | conmen]] is not limited to Hinduism.
*   In 2017, the Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad, a top body of Hindu Sadhus, released a list of 14 [[fraudulent_spiritual_leaders_in_india | fake Babas]], including Aasharam, Radhe Ma, Nirmal Baba, Gurmeet Singh, and Narayan Sai, warning people against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Other names involved in crimes include Nityanand, Mirchi Baba, and Jalebi Baba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   Muslim [[fraudulent_spiritual_leaders_in_india | fake Babas]] like Akmal Raza and Deen Mohammad have been implicated in exploiting individuals, including demanding a daughter for a cure or engaging in black magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   Christian Babas also engage in similar practices. In Kerala, a woman was blackmailed using her secret confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Bajinder Singh, with over 2 million YouTube subscribers, claims to guess names, dispel evil spirits, and cure disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. The film *Trance* (directed by Anwar Rasid) depicts such Christian Babas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   Even English-speaking "Babas," often perceived as credible by educated individuals, spread misinformation, such as claiming food rots during an eclipse or that angry glances at water can cause sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Some are even invited to IITs for lectures, highlighting a lack of scientific temperament in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

### Reasons for Public Susceptibility
People fall for [[fraudulent_spiritual_leaders_in_india | conmen]] due to various factors:
*   **Illiteracy**, though not the sole reason, contributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Educated individuals in good jobs are also conned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Deficiencies in the Indian education system**, which often neglects critical thinking, forcing children to learn without questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Blind faith**, where people choose to believe without requiring thought, questioning, or doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Exploitation of emotional vulnerability**, as [[fraudulent_spiritual_leaders_in_india | conmen]] target individuals who are frustrated or feel they have no solutions to their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Unlike developed countries where therapy is common for mental issues, India lacks a robust culture of seeking psychological help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Distinction Between Spiritual Gurus and Fraudsters
Mentalists like Karan Singh Magic and Suhani Shah also "read minds" but do so for entertainment, explicitly stating they are not providing cures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. The concept of "Babas" or spiritual guides is not inherently negative; historically, such figures studied scriptures, offered spiritual understanding, and acted as life coaches or counselors without charging fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Examples include Adi Shankaracharya, Baba Farid, Kabir, Guru Nanak, and Swami Vivekanand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. However, the current trend sees "jobless good-for-nothing people pretending to be Babas" who are fraudsters primarily interested in fooling people and running businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Exposing these [[fraudulent_spiritual_leaders_in_india | conmen]] is crucial to protect society and benefit both religion and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

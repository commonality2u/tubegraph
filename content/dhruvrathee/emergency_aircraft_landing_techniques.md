On April 28, 1988, Aloha Airlines Flight 243, a routine 35-minute flight from Hilo to Honolulu, experienced a catastrophic structural failure mid-flight, necessitating immediate and complex emergency landing techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. The incident, which saw a significant portion of the plane's roof blown away, highlighted the critical importance of pilot expertise and robust [[aviation_safety_procedures_and_regulations | aviation safety procedures and regulations]] during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Immediate Response and Emergency Descent

Twenty minutes after takeoff, at its cruising altitude of 24,000 feet, a sudden blast caused rapid decompression and the disintegration of approximately 35 mÂ² of the plane's forward fuselage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. In such conditions, the cabin's pressurization system, vital for normal breathing at high altitudes, fails, leading to thin air and risk of hypoxia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Oxygen masks are typically deployed for 15-20 minutes, allowing pilots time to descend to an altitude below 10,000 feet where normal breathing is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Fortunately, the pilots, Captain Robert Schomstheimer and First Officer Mimi Tompkins, were alive and their oxygen masks were functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. They immediately put on their masks and initiated an emergency descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. They descended at a speed of 4,100 feet per minute, flying at approximately 500 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. Within three minutes, the plane reached 14,000 feet, alleviating the immediate threat of hypoxia for most passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## Challenges During Emergency Landing

The structural integrity of the aircraft was severely compromised; the floor was the only component holding the cockpit and cabin together, raising fears that the plane could break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

Additional challenges faced during the emergency landing included:
*   **Diversion to Closer Airport** The flight was advised by Honolulu [[Air Traffic Control and radar technology | Air Traffic Control]] to land in Maui, as it was closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
*   **Terrain Navigation** Approaching Maui, the plane encountered the 10,000-foot Haleakala Summit between itself and the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Captain Schomstheimer skillfully slowed the plane from 210 knots to 170 knots, carefully navigating between two islands to evade the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.
*   **Landing Gear Malfunction** While the main landing gear deployed successfully, the nose gear initially failed to release properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Engine Failure** As the plane descended, its left engine failed, causing the aircraft to move side-to-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Despite attempts to manually restart it, the engine remained inoperable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

## The Landing

Despite the nose gear issue, the pilots decided to attempt the landing. This was a critical decision, as a "Belly Landing" (landing without front wheels) was deemed too risky due to the plane's weakened [[airplane_structural_fatigue_and_corrosion | structural fatigue and corrosion]] and the potential for a catastrophic fire or explosion if fuel tanks were compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

> "This airplane, and the condition it was in, because it didn't have a nose gear, because when the nose touch down on the runway, it would've broken the airplane apart, therefore, breaking probably the fuel tanks apart. Which could lead to a very dramatic fire and explosion." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>
---

Minutes before touchdown, a person on the runway tracking the plane with binoculars observed that the nose gear had, in fact, successfully released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. At 1:58 PM, exactly 13 minutes and 42 seconds after the explosion, Aloha Airlines Flight 243 touched down safely on the Maui runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. The captains utilized brakes and the thrust reverser of the remaining engine to bring the plane to a halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

Emergency teams, including firefighters and ambulances, were on standby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. Passengers were deboarded through emergency exits, grateful to the crew for their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

## Outcomes and Legacy

The successful landing, despite immense challenges, was largely attributed to the pilots' skill and the passengers wearing seatbelts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. One flight attendant, C.B. Lansing, was tragically lost, but the remaining 94 individuals survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

This incident served as a critical turning point in [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | aviation safety improvements post-1996]]. It prompted re-inspection of all older Boeing aircraft, revealing similar widespread cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>. Global [[aviation_safety_procedures_and_regulations | safety regulations]] were significantly tightened, leading to the 1991 Federal Aviation Authority's Aging Aircraft Safety Program, which mandated inspections for all old aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>. Crack detection techniques were improved using methods like Eddy Current and ultrasonic testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>. New rules were also established for high-cycle planes, requiring more frequent inspections for aircraft used on short-duration flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>. The Aviation Safety Research Act of 1988 was passed to address issues of aging aircraft structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. This incident ultimately transformed [[aviation_safety_procedures_and_regulations | aviation safety standards]] forever, preventing similar accidents from occurring again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>.

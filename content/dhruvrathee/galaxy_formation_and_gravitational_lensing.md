The [[james_webb_space_telescope_discoveries|James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST), the largest and most powerful space science telescope ever built, has provided unprecedented images and data that offer insights into the early universe and the processes of galaxy formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. NASA publicly released these images, which include glimpses of the oldest parts of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The Webb telescope is specifically designed to observe the [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation|formation]] of the first stars and galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, utilizing its [[infrared_imaging_and_spectrography|infrared imaging and spectrography]] capabilities to look through gas and dust clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Earliest Glimpse of the Universe

One of the most historic photos released by NASA offers a view from 13 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This allows humanity to see 13.1 billion years into the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. American President Joe Biden described this image as "a new window into the history of our universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The photo primarily depicts a galaxy cluster named SMACS 0723 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The galaxies appearing redder in color are further away from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Capturing this image was a complex process, taking 12.5 hours and requiring the telescope to combine several different images taken at various wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Gravitational Lensing

In the image of SMACS 0723, galaxies closer to the telescope exert a high gravitational force, distorting the light from objects behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This phenomenon creates a natural magnifying glass, enabling the observation of objects otherwise too faint or distant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This effect is known as Gravitational Lensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Galaxy Interactions: Stephan's Quintet

Another significant image features a cluster of five galaxies called Stephan's Quintet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While named a quintet, it is more accurately a "quadtet" because the leftmost galaxy is 40 million light-years away, distinct from the other four, which are approximately 290 million light-years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The leftmost galaxy appears clearer and more defined compared to the other four, which look blurrier due to their greater distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. These four galaxies are so close to each other that their dust and stars have begun to interact, demonstrating the effects of their mutual gravitational forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Scientists find this interaction highly valuable for understanding what occurs when galaxies approach each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

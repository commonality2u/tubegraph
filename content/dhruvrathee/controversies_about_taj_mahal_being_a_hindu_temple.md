From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

The [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] is a subject of various controversies, particularly claims that it was originally a Hindu temple. These theories often assert that idols of Hindu Gods are hidden behind the 22 closed doors within the monument, or that the structure itself is a Shiv Temple called Tejo Mahalaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Some proponents of this theory suggest that it was built in the 13th century by Raja Paramardi Dev, not by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Another variation claims Shah Jahan merely bought it from Raja Jai Singh's grandson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## [[Debate over 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal | Debate Over 22 Closed Doors]]

A significant part of the controversy centers on the 22 closed doors within the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]].
In May 2022, BJP politician Rajneesh Singh filed a petition in the Allahabad High Court demanding that the 22 closed rooms of the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] be opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He sought a special committee from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to investigate if Hindu God idols were present inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The petition claimed the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] was a Hindu Temple, Tejo Mahalaya, and sought opening under Freedom of Information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The court dismissed the petition, stating that such filings mocked the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) system and lacked legal or constitutional grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The court emphasized that historical research is conducted by historians using proper methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### ASI's Clarification and Evidence

Despite the court's dismissal, the debate continued in media and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) responded to end the speculation:
*   **Nature of "Rooms"**: ASI sources clarified that the 22 "rooms" are not independent rooms but rather a long corridor with doors along its side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: These doors have not always been locked; ASI staff clean the corridor every week or every couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: A retired ASI official explained that there is nothing on the walls and that such underground rooms are common in Mughal monuments, including Humayun's Tomb and Safdarjung Tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. These areas serve as structural elements upon which the monument rests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Locking Policy**: The areas were cordoned off because there was nothing for tourists to see, and keeping them open unnecessarily would lead to crowding and wear and tear, threatening the monument's preservation as a protected World Heritage Site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Public Photos**: To definitively end the debate, the ASI publicly released photographs of the closed rooms, showcasing the ongoing restoration work and their interior appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Agra's ASI Chief R. K. Patel confirmed these pictures are available on the ASI website as part of their newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Earlier Petitions and Historical Refutations

The 2022 petition was not the first of its kind. In April 2015, six lawyers filed a similar suit in an Agra court, claiming the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] was a Shiv Temple and seeking permission for Hindu worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This plea also asserted that Raja Paramardi Dev built Tejo Mahalaya in 1212 AD, which was later inherited by Raja Maan Singh and then Raja Jai Singh, before Shah Jahan supposedly annexed it in 1632 and converted it into a memorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The Central Government, Union Ministry of Culture, Home Secretary, and ASI were directed to reply to this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. In November 2015, Union Cultural Minister Mahesh Sharma stated in the Lok Sabha that the government found no evidence of the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] being a Hindu Temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The ASI reiterated this stance in 2017, confirming the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] is a tomb, not a temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### The Land Acquisition for Taj Mahal

The claim that Shah Jahan "annexed" the land from Raja Jai Singh is also addressed by historical records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The land where the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] stands was Raja Jai Singh's home, referred to as 'Haveli', 'Khana', or 'Manzil' in various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Raja Jai Singh, due to close relations between the Jaipur royals and the Mughals, initially offered to donate the land for free to build Mumtaz Mahal's tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. However, Shah Jahan did not accept it for free and instead gave Raja Jai Singh four palaces in exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. This transaction was officially recorded on December 28, 1633, and the record can be seen in Jaipur's City Palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## [[Influence of PN Oak on Taj Mahal conspiracy theories | Influence of P.N. Oak]]

The origin of these Hindu temple claims is largely attributed to Purushottam Nagesh Oak, also known as [[Influence of PN Oak on Taj Mahal conspiracy theories | P.N. Oak]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. [[Influence of PN Oak on Taj Mahal conspiracy theories | P.N. Oak]] was a history enthusiast, not a historian, who "rewrote history" based on superficial similarities or personal interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
His methodology involved making connections based on phonetic similarities, such as suggesting "Vatican" might come from the Sanskrit word 'Vatika,' or that Westminster Abbey was once a Hindu temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. He even claimed Christianity, Islam, and Judaism originated from Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

[[Influence of PN Oak on Taj Mahal conspiracy theories | P.N. Oak]] created the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] conspiracy theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[0:15:48]</a>. He initially claimed the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] was an ancient Hindu wonder, but after historians refuted this, he revised his claim to say it was built in 1155 by Raja Paramardi Dev's Chief Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. He published pamphlets like "Taj Mahal: The True Story" in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
In 2000, he filed a PIL based on his own pamphlet, claiming Shah Jahan acquired Raja Jai Singh's palace, blending one historical fact with fabricated details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. The Supreme Court dismissed his petition, calling it a "misconceived notion" and even ridiculing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Propagation through "WhatsApp University"

Despite judicial dismissals and historical evidence, [[Influence of PN Oak on Taj Mahal conspiracy theories | P.N. Oak]]'s fictional tales gained traction around 2010 with the rise of "WhatsApp University" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. These stories are frequently forwarded, leading people to believe them as true accounts and resulting in new petitions filed in courts, which then waste time on "futile petitions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. For example, while [[Influence of PN Oak on Taj Mahal conspiracy theories | P.N. Oak]] claimed the [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] was built in 1155, later petitions, fueled by this spread, shifted the date to 1212 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[History of the Taj Mahal | Taj Mahal]] remains one of the official Seven Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The extensive historical records, archaeological findings, and repeated dismissals by courts confirm its identity as a tomb built by Shah Jahan for Mumtaz Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

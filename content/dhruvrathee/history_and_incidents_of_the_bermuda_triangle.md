The Bermuda Triangle is renowned as a mysterious area of the ocean where an unusually high number of aircraft and ships have reportedly disappeared without a trace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:15">[03:42:15]</a>. This region, also known as the Devil's Triangle, the Graveyard of the Atlantic, the Sea of Doom, or Sargasso Graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>, spans over 500,000 square miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a> and is located between Florida in the USA, Puerto Rico, and the country of Bermuda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## Origin of the Mystery

The modern notoriety of the Bermuda Triangle largely stems from the incident involving Flight 19 in 1945.

### Flight 19 Disappearance (1945)

On December 5, 1945, at 2:10 PM, five US Navy torpedo bomber aircraft embarked on a routine three-hour training mission from Florida, known as Flight 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The flight consisted of 14 crew members led by Lieutenant Charles Carol Taylor, an experienced pilot and war veteran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Approximately two hours after takeoff, the squadron leader reported sudden compass malfunctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Both the primary and backup compasses failed, and other planes' instruments also malfunctioned, preventing them from determining their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

Confusing messages were transmitted over the radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. As the weather worsened, Taylor believed they were over the Gulf of Mexico and commanded the planes to fly east to return to Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. However, some crew members believed they were already east of Florida and needed to fly westward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Despite the debate, the weather continued to deteriorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. At this point, the planes were believed to be 370 km east of Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. The last radio transmission from Taylor was received at 7:04 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Subsequently, all five planes and their 14 crew members were lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Search-and-Rescue Mariner Disappearance

After Flight 19 vanished, a Search-and-Rescue Mariner aircraft with a crew of 13 people was dispatched to find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. However, this Mariner aircraft also disappeared while on its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. A large-scale air-and-sea search operation, one of the biggest at the time, was conducted for days, but no wreckage or bodies from either Flight 19 or the Mariner aircraft were ever found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Both planes disappeared in the area now known as the Bermuda Triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## Early Historical Accounts

Tales related to the Bermuda Triangle area predate its modern naming, with accounts going back over 500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

### Christopher Columbus's Report (1492)

In 1492, Christopher Columbus reported that his compass stopped working while passing through this area on his voyage to the New World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. He also saw a peculiar light, described as a ball of fire, fall from the sky into the ocean one night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Scientists later suggested this "ball of fire" was likely a meteor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.

## Coining the Term "Bermuda Triangle"

The specific name "Bermuda Triangle" was first used in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Vincent H. Gaddis published an article titled 'The Deadly Bermuda Triangle' in *Argosy* magazine, which summarized many disappearances over several decades and attempted to link them to create a sense of mystery in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. This article significantly popularized the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle, leading to numerous books, films, and songs on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

## Other Notable Incidents

### USS Cyclops Disappearance (1918)

In 1918, the USS Cyclops, one of the largest and fastest US Navy ships at the time, disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This ship was crucial during World War I for transporting troops and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. On March 4, 1918, with 306 people and 11,000 tonnes of manganese aboard, it departed from the West Indies Baltimore towards Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. The last message from the ship confirmed its departure under clear weather conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. After this, the USS Cyclops vanished suddenly, shocking everyone due to its immense size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.

### The Ellen Austin Mystery (1881)

The Ellen Austin, a 210-foot ship traveling from London to New York in 1881, reportedly encountered an unidentified ship near the Bermuda Triangle area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. The encountered ship appeared normal but had no crew or people aboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. After waiting two days for a response, the captain of the Ellen Austin boarded the ship, finding all valuable items intact, suggesting it hadn't been attacked by pirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

The captain decided to send some of his crew to sail the unidentified ship alongside the Ellen Austin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. After two days, a storm separated the ships, and the unidentified vessel disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. When the Ellen Austin captain later spotted it again, there was once again no trace of the crew members he had sent aboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. The story claims the captain attempted this again, with the same result of the ship separating in a storm and the new crew disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Upon Ellen Austin's return, its owner reportedly sold the ship, which was renamed Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. This incident is widely considered an urban legend due to the inability to verify its details historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

## [[theories_explaining_bermuda_triangle_disappearances | Theories Explaining Disappearances]]

Many [[theories_explaining_bermuda_triangle_disappearances | theories]] attempt to explain the disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle, ranging from outlandish claims of alien abductions or sea monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a> to more [[scientific_perspectives_on_the_bermuda_triangle_phenomena | scientific perspectives]].

### [[scientific_perspectives_on_the_bermuda_triangle_phenomena | Scientific Perspectives on the Bermuda Triangle Phenomena]]

*   **Magnetism**: The Bermuda Triangle lies near an agonic line, where the magnetic North Pole aligns with the geographic North Pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. While these lines shift over time, the 0Â° line has been in the Bermuda Triangle area for the past 200-300 years, potentially causing compass confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
*   **Shallow Waters and Hidden Shoals**: Parts of the Bermuda Triangle, particularly around the Bahamas and Caribbean Islands, are very shallow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. In older times, ships could get stuck on hidden shoals, which are high points of land beneath the ocean not visible from the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.
*   **Hurricanes and Water Spouts**: The Bermuda Triangle area experiences one of the world's highest rates of hurricanes and water spouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. Florida and Cuba, frequently hit by hurricanes, are within this region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
*   **Methane Hydrates**: Some oceanic areas contain large fields of methane hydrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Laboratory experiments have shown that a high concentration of methane bubbles in water can lower its density and reduce a ship's buoyancy, causing it to sink instantly without warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. This could occur during underwater volcanic eruptions (mud volcanoes) that release methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. However, there is no direct evidence linking specific disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle to methane hydrate eruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.
*   **Baader-Meinhof Effect (Frequency Illusion)**: This psychological effect suggests that once attention is drawn to a specific phenomenon, it appears to occur more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. While significant disappearances have occurred in the Bermuda Triangle, similar incidents happen in other parts of the world's oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>, such as the Malaysian Airlines flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. The mystery gained prominence through "mystery-mongering" and the creation of fabricated stories, like that of the Ellen Austin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.

## Official Stance and Reality

Journalist Larry Kusche, author of 'The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved', concluded that while some incidents occurred, the mystery was amplified by fabricated stories and increased attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) states there is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur more frequently in the Bermuda Triangle compared to any other ocean area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. The United States Coast Guard does not recognize the Bermuda Triangle as a hazardous area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>. They attribute incidents to the area's heavy traffic of ships and planes, coupled with frequent hurricanes and the presence of the Gulf Stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.

In 2013, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conducted a study on the world's 10 most dangerous bodies of water for shipping, and the Bermuda Triangle was not on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. This suggests that the mysterious disappearances are not uniquely tied to the Bermuda Triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

This article explores various religious narratives, highlighting unexpected similarities across different traditions and discussing their interpretations and societal impact.

## Surprising Similarities in Religious Narratives

A thought experiment is presented where a story's main characters are given clues: a man whose name ends with "AM," his wife whose name starts with "S," a relative traveling with them whose name starts with "L," and a faraway king whose name ends with "N" who takes the woman captive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Initially, this might sound like the story of [[metaphorical_and_literal_interpretations_of_the_ramayana | Ramayana]], featuring Ram, Sita, Lakshman, and Ravan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, these blanks also fit another story: that of Prophet Abraham, with characters Abraham, Sarah, Lot, and Pharaoh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This story involves Abraham, Sarah, and Lot traveling south, and Sarah being taken by a Pharaoh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

## The Significance of Religious Discourses

Making videos about religions is deemed necessary today because religion is often exploited by politicians and media to spread fear and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Understanding different religions can foster empathy and brotherhood among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## The Abrahamic Religions and Monotheism

Prophet Abraham is considered a common prophet in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Many believe he was the first figure to preach [[Monotheism vs Polytheism | monotheism]], the belief in only one God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The opposite is [[Monotheism vs Polytheism | polytheism]], believing in multiple gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These three faiths are classified as [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Abrahamic religions]], deriving their name from Prophet Abraham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. While some Jews and Christians consider Abraham the first prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, other Christians suggest Enoch, a descendant of Adam, was the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Muslims, however, believe Adam was the first Prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Creation Story: Adam and Eve

The story of Adam and Eve (Aadm and Ava) is foundational to these religions.
God is believed to have created Adam from soil and breathed life into him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. After creation, Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden, which contained the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. God permitted Adam to eat from any tree except the Tree of Knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Feeling Adam might be lonely, God created animals and birds, but no suitable helper was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. While Adam slept, God took a bone from his body and created a woman, whom Adam named Eve (meaning "life") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

A snake misled Eve into eating the forbidden fruit, claiming it would make them like God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Eve ate the fruit and gave it to Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Angered, God cursed them:
*   The snake was cursed to crawl on its belly and eat dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Eve was cursed with intense labor pains during childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Adam was cursed to work hard for his entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
Adam and Eve were then expelled from the Garden of Eden to live on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This story has been referenced in pop culture, including the 2009 science fiction film *Knowing* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## The Great Flood: Noah's Ark

Thousands of years later, God observed humanity had become very evil and regretted creating them, deciding to wipe out all life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. However, Noah (Nuh in Islam) was a good person in God's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

God informed Noah of the impending great flood that would destroy everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. He instructed Noah to build a large ark and bring aboard his wife, their three sons and their wives, and a male and female of every living organism, along with sufficient food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. After the ark was built, it rained for 40 days and 40 nights, submerging the Earth for 150 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Noah's Ark remained afloat, and its occupants survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The ark eventually rested on Mount Ararat, the only dry land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. As the waters receded, they emerged to a new chance at life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The film *2012* has an indirect reference to Noah's Ark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, and a direct film based on this story is titled *Noah* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Noah made an offering and God promised never to destroy life in such a way again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Other Flood Narratives

Similar flood stories exist in other ancient cultures:
*   **Hinduism**: The story of King Manu, where a small fish (Matsya, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) warns him of a great flood and instructs him to build a boat to save living creatures, plants, and Saptarishis. The Matsya avatar then guides the boat to the Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Mesopotamia**: The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh features a sage named Utnapishtim, who was warned about a great flood and saved his relatives, living creatures, and food in a huge boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Greek Mythology**: Due to Zeus's anger, a great flood occurred. Deucalion was warned by his father Prometheus and built a boat with his wife to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Abram and the Breaking of Idols

A famous story about Abram (later Abraham) involves him breaking idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This narrative is found in Midrash Genesis Rabbah chapter 38 (a Jewish commentary on the Bible) and in the Qur'an (chapter 21, verses 51-70) with some differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

During an era of widespread idol worship, Abram's father, Terah, was an idol maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. One day, while in charge of his father's shop, Abram shamed a 50-year-old man for worshipping an idol less than a year old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Later, when alone, Abram broke all the idols except the largest one, placing the stick in its hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. When people questioned him, Abram claimed the idols had fought, and the biggest one broke the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. When people retorted that idols cannot fight or speak, Abram challenged their worship, asking why they worshipped statues that could not help or harm them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Abram was then ordered to enter a great fire, with the belief that if he was right, God would save him, which He did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Interpretation of Idol Worship and Misconceptions

Due to this story, idols are not worshipped in Judaism and Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Some conservative Muslims and Hindus may call Hindus "Kafirs" (disbelievers) for idol worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

However, Hindus do not worship idols themselves but worship God *through* the idol, similar to how one remembers a father by looking at his photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Acharya Prashanth states that the idol is a "good means to reach the formless" and it is never said that the idol *is* the true God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Christians also do not consider this wrong, as evidenced by statues of Jesus and Mary in churches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Biblical passages are cited to support this:
*   Exodus chapter 20, verses 4 and 5, forbids making and bowing down to idols of *other things*, not God's idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   Exodus chapter 25, verses 17 to 22, describes God commanding Prophet Moses to make a mercy seat with cherub idols, from which God would speak to Moses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   Hebrew Bible Ezekiel, chapter 41, verse 25, describes carvings of cherub and palm trees in the Temple of Jerusalem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
These passages suggest God does not object to using images or idols for worship, as long as the worship is directed *to* God, not *to* the idol itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

The Qur'an (Surah 4 Ayat 48 and Chapter 31 Ayat 13) states, "Do not associate partners with God," meaning to worship only God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Therefore, the notion that all Muslims consider non-Muslims "Kafirs" is a misconception spread by those who want to foster hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   The word 'Islam' means "Submission before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   A 'Muslim' is "one who submits before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
From a liberal Muslim perspective, anyone who believes in any religion and worships God, regardless of the name, is considered a Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
The Qur'an (chapter 2, verse 62) mentions Jews, Christians, and Sabians as believers in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. It only mentions fighting those who believe an idol to be God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, such as the Quraysh tribe who worshipped the stone idol Hubal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Prophet Muhammad broke this idol in 630 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

Beyond physical idols, the Qur'an also warns against idolizing property, wealth (chapter 18, verses 32-46), or one's ego and desires (chapter 25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Hinduism also contains similar warnings against idolizing ego, material desires, or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. While Hinduism presents various forms and avatars of God, it also speaks of [[Monotheism vs Polytheism | monotheism]], as seen in the Rigveda (Mandal 1, Shlok 46) and Yajurveda (Chapter 32), where God is referred to by many names and is described as the one creator of all beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### The "Kafir" Label and Violence in Scriptures

While [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Abrahamic religions]] generally do not deem people of other religions as "Kafirs," atheists are considered Kafirs because the term means "one who disbelieves in God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

Statements of violence in religious scriptures, like "Kill the Mushrik (disbelievers) wherever you find them" (Qur'an chapter 9 verse 5), "totally destroy everything that belongs to them" (Hebrew Bible, 1 Samuel chapter 15), "I did not come to bring peace but a sword" (Gospel of Matthew chapter 10 verses 34-36), and encouragements for warriors (Bhagavad Gita chapter 2 shloka 31-38), are heavily contextual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. When read in context, such as the Mahabharata war or conflicts with specific tribes (Quraysh, Amalekites), their meaning changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Jesus's "sword" statement is metaphorical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. No scripture actually commands killing innocent people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Terrorists and orthodox individuals misinterpret these scriptures to incite violence and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Scholars like Wahiduddin Khan, a recipient of the Padma Vibhushan award, emphasize Islam as a religion of peace and tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

## Abram's Journey and Renaming

Abram, his wife Sarai, and his nephew Lot left their home as God instructed Abram to go in search of a place God would show him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. Fleeing a famine, they traveled to Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Fearing the Egyptians would kill him for his beautiful wife, Abram instructed Sarai to say she was his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Pharaoh's officials took Sarai to the palace, and Abram received good treatment and many gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. However, Pharaoh's house was struck by serious diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Pharaoh confronted Abram about Sarai being his wife and sent them out of Egypt with all their possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

Later, Abram and Lot's shepherds quarreled, leading Abram and Lot to part ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Abram settled in Canaan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. As Abram and Sarai had no child, Sarai gave Abram her slave woman, Hagar, who bore a son named Ishmael <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. God then made an agreement with Abram, promising him to be the father of many nations, and renamed him Abraham. Sarai was renamed Sarah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. God also promised Abraham all the land of Canaan, stretching from the valley of Egypt to the Euphrates River, encompassing present-day Israel, West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, and parts of Syria and Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. This concept of a promised land became significant for the Zionist movement in Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

God promised Sarah a son, and Isaac was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Due to Ishmael's attitude, Sarah told Abraham to send him away. God confirmed this, and Hagar and Ishmael went into the desert, where God provided water and promised Hagar that Ishmael would make a great nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

## Descendants and Separation of Abrahamic Religions

This marks the point where the [[Comparison of Abrahamic Religions | Abrahamic religions]] diverge:
*   **Judaism and Christianity** trace their lineage through Isaac. Jews believe Isaac's son Jacob (renamed Israel) was the ancestor of the 12 tribes of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **Christianity** considers Jesus the most important prophet and a descendant of Isaac. Christians see themselves as spiritual descendants of Isaac through their belief in Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   **Islam** traces its spiritual lineage to Ishmael, believing Abraham and Ishmael together built the Kaaba in Mecca, Islam's most sacred site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

These stories highlight the interconnectedness and fundamental similarities among various religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Future explorations could delve into the stories of Prophet Joseph, Moses, the Ten Commandments, the conquest of Canaan by Joshua, and the lives of Prophet Jesus and Prophet Muhammad, as well as other religions like Buddhism, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

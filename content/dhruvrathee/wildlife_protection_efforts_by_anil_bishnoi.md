Anil Bishnoi, a 51-year-old farmer from Laksar, a village in Rajasthan, is a dedicated wildlife protector who has committed his life to saving wild animals, particularly blackbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. His story, published by The Better India, highlights his relentless efforts and passion for conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of a Protector

As a young man, Anil was deeply saddened by the monthly deaths of blackbucks in his district <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While in college, a conference by the Bishnoi community on forest and wildlife loss profoundly changed his perspective on life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. After completing his studies, he returned to his village with a firm resolve to protect blackbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Confronting Poachers

Despite being a 20-year-old at the time, Anil began standing up against hunters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He asked villagers to alert him about any planned hunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

On one occasion, informed about a hunt, he rode his motorcycle for 30 km on a cold winter night, but unfortunately, the deer had already been hunted by the time he arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He immediately called the police, leading to the hunter's arrest and a case filed under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Act, 1972, which served as a warning to local hunters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

In another instance, when confronting hunters alone, a gun was pointed at his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Though initially scared, he refused to hesitate if his life was necessary to save a species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The police later arrived and arrested the hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

To date, Anil Bishnoi has caught over 300 hunters red-handed, filing cases, presenting witness testimonies, and continuously following up to ensure criminals are jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Beyond Poaching: Holistic Conservation

Anil's efforts extend beyond combating poaching:
*   **Water Sources**: Recognizing other causes of blackbuck deaths, such as road accidents, extreme climates, and dog attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, he raised â‚¹200,000 from his village to prepare 66 'Pokhars' (water bodies) where animals can drink during summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Medical Aid**: He provides first aid to injured animals at his home or at the forest department's medical center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Orphan Care**: If a mother blackbuck or chinkara dies, he raises the young until they are ready to be released into the forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Impact and Recognition

Anil Bishnoi has built a team of approximately 3,000 people across 12 districts in Rajasthan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Over the years, he has saved around 10,000 blackbucks and chinkaras from being killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In recognition of his profound contributions, the Rajasthan government awarded him the Amrita Devi Environmental Protection Award in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

While some mistakenly praise [[lawrence_bishnois_criminal_activities_and_gang_involvement | Lawrence Bishnoi]] on social media, even comparing him to Bhagat Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, it is [[comparison_between_anil_bishnoi_and_lawrence_bishnoi | Anil Bishnoi]] who truly embodies the spirit of a real-life hero dedicated to the welfare of the country and its wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. His actions provide a genuine inspiration for leading a meaningful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

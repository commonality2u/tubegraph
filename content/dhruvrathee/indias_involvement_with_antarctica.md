Antarctica, the coldest, windiest, and driest continent, is unique as it is not a country, lacks a government, and has no indigenous tribal populations. It is also the only place on Earth with little to no direct human influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite its harsh conditions, various countries have historically laid claims to parts of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## India's Initial Stance on Antarctica

Initially, India was completely against the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. India believed that the treaty, signed by 12 governments, would be used by these countries to "capture" Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Concerns were raised that even if the land was used for peaceful purposes, signatory countries might engage in mining for resources like oil and profit from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. India appealed to the United Nations, proposing that the UN should take control of the entire continent, but this did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## First Indian Expedition

In December 1981, approximately 30 years after the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] was signed, India launched its first expedition to Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This expedition was conducted secretly to avoid alerting other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. It was led by renowned marine biologist Dr. Syed Zahoor Qasim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. India borrowed an icebreaker ship named the *Polar Circle* from Norway for this mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The expedition was successful, leading the *New Scientist* magazine to jokingly publish the headline, "Indians Quietly Invade Antarctica" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Although a research expedition, it was technically illegal at the time as India was not a signatory to the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Shift in Policy and Treaty Accession

During the Cold War, India was part of the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. In 1983, Non-Aligned countries heavily lobbied the United Nations, compelling the General Assembly to agree to discuss Antarctica at an upcoming meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Surprisingly, about a month before this UN meeting, India signed the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] and applied for Consultative Party status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This abrupt change in stance was quite shocking to other nations, as India had previously opposed the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## India's Presence and Research Contributions

Today, India maintains two active stations in Antarctica, conducting continuous geological studies and [[scientific_research_and_discoveries_in_antarctica | research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. A notable contribution came from scientist Sudipta Sengupta, who participated in India's second expedition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Her [[scientific_research_and_discoveries_in_antarctica | research]] revealed that the Schirmacher Hills on the Antarctic coast were once part of a fault line connected to the Indian subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This landmass broke away from India, leading to India's northward movement and collision with Tibet, which subsequently formed the Himalayas and made India part of the Asian continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Environmental Protection Advocacy

In 1991, the [[environmental_protection_and_mining_ban_in_antarctica | Environmental Protection Treaty]], also known as the Madrid Protocol, was signed in Madrid, Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This treaty finally imposed restrictions on drilling and [[environmental_protection_and_mining_ban_in_antarctica | mining activities]] in Antarctica, ensuring the continent's protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. This was considered crucial due to the vast reserves of oil and gas estimated to be under Antarctica, with some experts claiming up to 500 billion barrels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. The Madrid Protocol is a primary reason oil mining has not yet been conducted, alongside the high cost of extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. However, the melting ice due to climate change could make access easier and extraction more economically viable in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. The [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] is set to expire in 2048, and whether it will be renewed remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

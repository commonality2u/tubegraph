Humanity has long pondered the existence of other intelligent species in the universe, leading NASA to spearhead numerous projects aimed at establishing communication with potential extraterrestrial life [00:00:01]. This quest involves sending messages into space, with some of the most notable efforts stemming from the [[nasas_voyager_missions | NASA's Voyager Missions]] [00:00:26].

## Interstellar Missions
The space between solar systems within our Milky Way galaxy is known as [[interstellar_exploration | Interstellar Space]] [00:00:53]. To date, NASA has launched five interstellar spacecraft: Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and New Horizons [00:01:04]. Of these, only Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have managed to reach interstellar space due to the immense distances involved [00:01:14].

### The Voyager Missions
The [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] and [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]] spacecraft were launched in 1977 with the mission to explore our solar system's outer planets, the edges of the Sun's influence, and beyond [00:00:34].

#### The Gravity Assist Principle
An engineer at NASA observed in 1965 that Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune would align in a unique geometric arrangement in the late 1970s, an occurrence that happens only once every 175 years [00:02:37]. This alignment allowed spacecraft to utilize the planets' gravitational forces to accelerate and alter their trajectories with minimal fuel and time, a principle known as "Gravity Assist" [00:03:01]. This principle dictated the 1977 launch year for the Voyager missions [00:03:19].

#### Mission Profiles
*   **[[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]]**: Tasked with flying by Jupiter and Saturn, with a special focus on Saturn's moon Titan [00:03:28]. Its route was designed to be shorter and faster than Voyager 2's [00:05:03].
*   **[[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]]**: Programmed to pass by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune [00:03:37]. Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977, 16 days before Voyager 1 [00:04:48].

#### Spacecraft Design and Technology
Both Voyager spacecraft share similar designs [00:03:42]:
*   **Power Source**: They are powered by three Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) [00:03:45]. Unlike solar panels, which become ineffective beyond Mars and Jupiter due to weak sunlight, RTGs generate electricity from the heat released by the radioactive decay of plutonium [00:03:50].
*   **Scientific Instruments**: Each probe carries 10 scientific instruments [00:04:20], including:
    *   A two-camera imaging system for photography [00:04:24].
    *   A spectrometer to measure hydrogen abundance [00:04:28].
    *   Another spectrometer for ultraviolet activity [00:04:32].
    *   A magnetometer to measure planetary magnetic fields [00:04:35].
    *   A high-gain antenna for communication with Earth [00:04:39].
    *   Smaller instruments to measure radiation levels [00:04:43].

#### Planetary Discoveries and Observations
The Voyager missions provided unprecedented insights into our solar system's outer planets:
*   **Jupiter**:
    *   [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] reached Jupiter first in March 1979 [00:05:08], capturing a remarkable time-lapse of the planet and its moons [00:05:12]. These were the first clear-cut photos of Jupiter and its moons [00:05:26].
    *   The missions discovered Jupiter's rings, dispelling the common belief that only Saturn had them [00:05:31].
    *   [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] revealed ongoing volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io, marking the first time active volcanoes were seen on another celestial body [00:06:20].
    *   The number of known moons for Jupiter increased from 13 to 16 due to Voyager discoveries [00:06:32]. As of the transcript's information, 95 different moons orbiting Jupiter have been discovered [00:07:00].
    *   The collective system of Jupiter, its moons, and rings is called the Jovian system, extending to other gas giants like Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which also have rings and multiple moons [00:05:42].
*   **Saturn**:
    *   [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] arrived near Saturn on November 12, 1980 [00:07:11].
    *   It discovered three new moons: Atlas, Prometheus, and Pandora [00:07:23].
    *   The missions captured photos of many of Saturn's moons, with Titan being particularly interesting due to clear evidence of liquid water, making it a subject of science fiction for potential alien life or human habitation [00:07:43]. The number of known moons of Saturn has increased to around 146 [00:07:38].
*   **Uranus and Neptune**: [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]] became the first and only man-made object to conduct fly-bys near Uranus (1986) and Neptune (1989), providing marvelous photos of these distant planets [00:08:14].

#### Journey to Interstellar Space
After crossing Saturn, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] changed its trajectory and left the Ecliptic Plane (the imaginary plane on which solar system planets orbit the Sun) [00:08:11]. It became extremely fast, traveling at over 60,000 km per hour [00:08:58].

*   **Pale Blue Dot**: On February 14, 1990, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] took the famous "Pale Blue Dot" photo from approximately 6 billion kilometers away, showing Earth as a small blue speck [00:09:22]. It also captured a "family portrait" of the inner solar system, including Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune [00:09:44]. After these photos, Voyager 1's cameras were shut down to conserve power and memory [00:10:07].
*   **Termination Shock and Heliosphere**: In 2004, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] passed the Termination Shock, a point at the solar system's edge where the solar wind (charged particles from the Sun forming the Heliosphere bubble that protects from [[interstellar_exploration | interstellar radiation]]) suddenly decreases [00:10:36]. The outer boundary of the Heliosphere is called the Heliopause [00:11:00].
*   **Entry into Interstellar Space**: On August 25, 2012, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] exited the Heliosphere and officially entered [[interstellar_exploration | Interstellar Space]] [00:11:32]. This was confirmed by its plasma wave instruments, which detected a sudden increase in electron density due to interstellar wind, differing from the solar wind-driven density inside the Heliosphere [00:13:52]. NASA confirmed this achievement in September 2013, marking the first time a man-made object crossed the solar system's limits [00:12:09].
*   **[[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]]** followed six years later, entering interstellar space on November 5, 2018 [00:16:05].
*   **Communication**: Both Voyagers communicate with Earth via their high-gain antennas, transmitting data to NASA's three deep space network stations located in California, Madrid, and Canberra, Australia [00:14:50].
*   **Future**: [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] is currently traveling at 61,198 km per hour, approximately 25 billion kilometers from Earth [00:25:18]. Its power supply is gradually depleting, with estimates suggesting it might be entirely depleted by 2025, which could sever communication [00:25:33].

## Messages for Aliens

### Pioneer Plaque
Before the Voyagers, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 carried messages for aliens on a small, gold-anodized aluminum plate known as the Pioneer plaque [00:16:27]. This 15 cm by 23 cm plate, dubbed "a mark of man" by NASA, features five engraved diagrams [00:16:44]:
*   **Location Map**: A radial diagram showing the Sun's position relative to 14 pulsars, intended to guide aliens to our location in the galaxy [00:17:03]. Understanding this requires a basic knowledge of pulsars and their regular pulses [00:17:15].
*   **Solar System Diagram**: The planets of our solar system are depicted, with the Sun on the far left and an arrow pointing to the third planet (Earth) as the origin of the spacecraft [00:17:26].
*   **Spacecraft Silhouette**: A silhouette of the Pioneer spacecraft itself is included [00:17:39].
*   **Human Figures**: Drawings of a man and a woman are included to show what humans look like [00:17:42].
NASA intended this "interstellar slab" to convey humanity's spiritual insight beyond material concerns [00:17:54]. However, it provides only basic information [00:18:03].

### Voyager Golden Record
The [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager missions]] carried more detailed messages in the form of two 12-inch gold-plated copper discs and phonograph records, known as the "Golden Record" [00:18:11]. These records store both voices and images [00:18:23].

#### Golden Record Contents
The contents are divided into four sections:
1.  **Scenes from Earth**: Contains 115 images and diagrams providing information about our planet and its species [00:19:33]. This includes basic mathematical, chemical, and physical definitions [00:19:41].
    *   **Image Storage**: Due to limited data storage (Voyagers' computers could store only 69 KB), images were projected onto a screen, recorded by a television camera, converted into audio waveforms, and stored in audio form on the disks [00:22:06]. To view them, aliens would need to reverse this process [00:22:36].
    *   **Examples of Images**: The first image is a white calibration circle to represent the record's shape and confirm proper decoding [00:23:04]. Subsequent images include mathematical concepts, physical units, solar system parameters (including Pluto), individual photos of planets (Mercury, Mars, Earth, Jupiter), chemical elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus), DNA structures, cells, and aspects of human life and capabilities (e.g., eating, drinking) [00:23:17]. Notable landmarks like the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal are also included [00:24:30].
    *   **Portrayal of Humanity**: The images deliberately omit negative aspects such as conflict or war, presenting an "ideal version of humanity" [00:24:33].
2.  **Greetings from Earth**: Features greetings spoken by humans in 55 languages [00:19:46]. It also includes printed messages from then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter and then-UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim [00:19:52].
3.  **Music from Earth**: Comprises 28 audio recordings of musical selections from diverse cultures and eras, including an Indian song based on Raag Bhairavi, "Jaat Kahan Ho," sung by Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar [00:20:09].
4.  **Sounds of Earth**: Features 21 audio recordings of natural sounds from Earth, such as human activities, machines, and natural phenomena [00:20:28].

#### Operating Instructions
Instructions on how to operate the phonograph are included in diagrammatic form, not in human languages, though their complexity makes them challenging to understand even for humans [00:20:51]. Similarly, the instructions for decoding the images, presented on the "interstellar envelope," are highly technical [00:22:40].

The ultimate question remains whether these messages will ever reach an alien species, and if so, whether that species will possess the intelligence required to decode them [00:25:00].

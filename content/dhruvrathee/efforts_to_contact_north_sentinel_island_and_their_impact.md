## Early Accounts and Misconceptions
The earliest written record of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands dates back to the 2nd century AD, when Roman mathematician Claudius Ptolemy described them as the "Islands of Cannibals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42">[06:42]</a>. This description was not limited to North Sentinel Island but encompassed the entire archipelago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55">[06:55]</a>. Later, in 673 AD, a Chinese traveler journeying from Sumatra to India also reported the islanders as cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06">[07:06]</a>. Arab travelers in the 8th and 9th centuries and inscriptions from Raja Raja Chola I's reign in the 11th century echoed similar beliefs, considering the islands impure and inhabited by cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16">[07:16]</a>. These ancient accounts, however, are believed to be inaccurate regarding the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] people being cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47">[18:47]</a>.

The first specific mention of North Sentinel Island occurred in 1771 when an East India Company ship observed light on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35">[07:35]</a>.

## Initial Encounters and Violence
In 1867, an Indian merchant ship carrying about 100 passengers was shipwrecked on the island's shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49">[07:49]</a>. The survivors were attacked by the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] but were fortunately rescued by the British Royal Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56">[07:56]</a>. This marked the first recorded instance of the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | North Sentinelese]] actively driving out outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04">[08:04]</a>.

### Maurice Vidal Portman's Expedition (1880)
In 1880, British officer Maurice Vidal Portman sought to establish contact and "civilise" the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14">[08:14]</a>. He brought members of other Andamanese tribes, hoping for communication, but discovered their languages were mutually unintelligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36">[08:36]</a>. Portman then kidnapped an elderly couple and four children from North Sentinel Island, taking them to Port Blair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56">[08:56]</a>. The old couple died shortly after arriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07">[09:07]</a>. Portman returned the children to the island with gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18">[09:18]</a>. It is widely believed that these children inadvertently introduced foreign germs and bacteria to the isolated tribe, against which they had no immunity, potentially leading to fatalities among the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25">[09:25]</a>. This incident is considered a significant reason for the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]]'s subsequent violence towards outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58">[09:58]</a>.

## Indian Government Expeditions
After India's independence, several expeditions were conducted to North Sentinel Island.
*   **1967:** Triloknath Pandit became the first official anthropologist to visit, leading a team of 20, including scientists and armed forces. They followed footprints for about 1 km but found no humans, leaving gifts like coconuts, pots, pans, and iron tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10">[10:10]</a>.
*   **1970:** An official research team placed a stone tablet declaring North Sentinel Island part of Indian Territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41">[10:41]</a>.
*   **1974:** An Indian film crew, accompanied by Triloknath Pandit and armed forces, made a documentary. They left coconuts and a live pig as gifts. Tribal people emerged, attacking them with bows and arrows, wounding the director, Prem Vaidya, and killing and burying the pig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50">[10:50]</a>. This was the first time the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | North Sentinelese]] were filmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34">[11:34]</a>.
*   **1970s-1990s:** Triloknath Pandit made repeated attempts, consistently encountering violence. The tribe would kill and bury pigs and even dolls left as gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39">[11:39]</a>.

### MV Primrose Shipwreck (1981)
In 1981, the merchant ship Primrose ran aground on the island during a storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00">[12:00]</a>. The [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] attacked the passengers, though the weather prevented arrows from hitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09">[12:09]</a>. The crew was rescued a week later by helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21">[12:21]</a>. This incident is significant as it marked the first time the tribe encountered and scavenged iron, which they subsequently incorporated into their tools like bows and arrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31">[12:31]</a>. The shipwreck is still visible on Google Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53">[12:53]</a>.

### Brief Friendly Contact (1991)
In a unique turn of events, 1991 saw the first friendly contact with the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | North Sentinelese]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00">[13:00]</a>.
*   **January 1991:** Indian anthropologist Madhumala Chattopadhyay led an unarmed expedition. They offered coconuts, and this time, the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] accepted them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12">[13:12]</a>. It has been theorized that the presence of a woman might have influenced this positive reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26">[13:26]</a>.
*   **The Next Day:** On a return visit, a [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] man aimed an arrow at the team, but a [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] woman intervened, pushing the arrow down and gesturing for him not to shoot. The man complied, burying his weapon, allowing the expedition members to land and hand coconuts directly to the tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36">[13:36]</a>.
*   **One Month Later:** Another expedition with Triloknath Pandit and Madhumala also saw friendly interaction, with the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] accepting coconuts without violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08">[14:08]</a>.

This period of friendly contact was short-lived. After 1991, subsequent attempts to engage the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] again met with violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20">[14:20]</a>. The reason for this shift in behavior remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34">[14:34]</a>.

## Indian Government Policy and Recent Incidents
Recognizing the consistent hostility and the tribe's desire for isolation, the Indian government banned all visits to the island after 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41">[14:41]</a>. They adopted an "Eyes-On, Hands-Off" policy, monitoring the tribe from a distance to offer assistance if needed while respecting their isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58">[14:58]</a>.

*   **2004 Tsunami:** Following the devastating Indian Ocean Tsunami, Indian Coast Guard officials flew a helicopter over the island to check on the tribe's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07">[15:07]</a>. The helicopter was met with a shower of arrows, confirming the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] had survived and were well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19">[15:19]</a>. The island itself had been lifted by 1.5 meters due to the Tsunami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26">[15:26]</a>.
*   **2006 Fishermen Incident:** Two local fishermen accidentally drifted too close to the island and were killed by the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33">[15:33]</a>. In response, the government established a 5 km exclusion zone around the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42">[15:42]</a>.
*   **2018 John Allen Chau Incident:** In November 2018, 26-year-old American missionary John Allen Chau illegally went to North Sentinel Island, obsessed with teaching Christianity to the tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00">[00:00]</a>. He bribed a fisherman to drop him off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31">[00:31]</a>. Despite an initial encounter where he was shot at (the arrow hitting his Bible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31">[02:31]</a> and his kayak stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24">[02:24]</a>, he returned to the island on November 16, 2018, and was killed. The fisherman witnessed the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] burying his body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[03:32]</a>.

## Debate on Continued Contact
There is an ongoing [[debate_on_modern_contact_with_isolated_tribes | debate on modern contact with isolated tribes]].
*   **Arguments for Contact:** Some believe efforts should continue to introduce the [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] to the outside world, sharing technology and bringing "development and modernisation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50">[19:50]</a>.
*   **Arguments for Isolation (Majority View):** Many argue for protecting the tribe from the outside world and allowing them to remain isolated and peaceful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06">[20:06]</a>. Key reasons include:
    *   **Disease Vulnerability:** The [[history_of_north_sentinel_island_and_north_sentinelese_people | Sentinelese]] have no immunity to common diseases carried by outsiders, risking widespread death upon contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25">[20:25]</a>.
    *   **Negative Historical Precedents:** Attempts to integrate other [[uncontacted_tribes_and_their_isolation | tribes]] (like the Jarawa in Andaman) have shown negative consequences. While some adapted, many became unhappy. They struggled with modern foods (leading to obesity), became addicted to substances like tobacco and alcohol, and faced the loss of their culture, language, and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36">[20:36]</a>. The Great Andamanese Tribe, which numbered around 5,000 in the 1800s, has only 41 remaining members today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45">[21:45]</a>, highlighting the dangers of forced integration.

The current policy of isolation aims to prevent the eradication of their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54">[21:54]</a>.

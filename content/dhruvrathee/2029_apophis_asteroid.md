The Apophis asteroid, more than 1000 feet (approximately 300 meters) in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, is an actual celestial body that will pass very close to Earth on April 13, 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Initially, there were significant concerns about a potential impact, but further observations have debunked this threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Discovery and Initial Threat Assessment

Apophis was discovered in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Following initial observations, scientists calculated a 2.7% chance of the asteroid colliding with Earth in 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Although this probability meant a 97% chance of non-collision, the potential consequences were so devastating that even a small risk was terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. If it were to hit Earth, it could release energy equivalent to 1 million times the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, causing tsunami waves hundreds of meters high and wiping out entire cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This led to Apophis being dubbed the "City Killer" and the "most dangerous asteroid" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Origin of the Name

The name Apophis is derived from Egyptian mythology, where Apophis is depicted as a giant snake that destroys everything and is known as the God of Chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## The 2029 Close Approach

The close approach of Apophis in 2029 is not hypothetical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. On April 13, 2029, the asteroid will pass by Earth at a distance of only 30,000 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, which is closer than many geostationary satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. It will be visible to the naked eye at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. NASA has released a video illustrating the exact path of the Apophis asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Debunking the Threat and Future Predictions

After extensive further observations, scientists determined that Apophis has a 0% chance of colliding with Earth in 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Concerns then shifted to potential future collisions in 2036 or 2068 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This was due to the asteroid potentially passing through a "Keyhole Area" in 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Keyholes are regions in space close to Earth where the planet's gravitational force can affect a passing asteroid, potentially altering its orbit and increasing collision risk for future passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

However, this threat has also been debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. NASA has confidently stated that Apophis will not collide with Earth in the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Consequently, it has been removed from the [[near_earth_objects_and_risk_management | Near-Earth Objects]] risk list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Broader Context of Asteroid Threats

The initial concerns about Apophis highlighted the importance of planetary defense and the monitoring of [[near_earth_objects_and_risk_management | Near Earth Objects]] (NEOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Organizations like the European Space Agency maintain a risk list of potentially dangerous asteroids and comets, including their impact dates, probabilities, and sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The experience with Apophis underscores the need for robust detection systems and mitigation strategies to prevent scenarios like the [[extinction_of_dinosaurs_due_to_asteroid_impact | extinction of dinosaurs]] 66 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Although false alarms, such as the [[2038_fake_asteroid_strike_news | completely fake news regarding a 2038 asteroid strike]] based on a NASA hypothetical exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, can circulate, the scientific community continues to advance Earth's defense systems against actual cosmic threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

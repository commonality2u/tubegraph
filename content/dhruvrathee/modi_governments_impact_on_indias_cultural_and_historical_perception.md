The [[Modi governments impact on Indias cultural and historical perception | Modi government's Impact on India's Cultural and Historical Perception]]

Since May 2014, there has been a narrative suggesting that the world suddenly started to "look up at India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perception is actively promoted by the government and its supporters, claiming a new era of global recognition for India.

## Assertions of India's Global Standing Post-2014

Various political figures, including Prime Minister [[Narendra Modis image and cult of personality | Narendra Modi]], have repeatedly stated that "When India speaks, the whole world listens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This sentiment has been echoed by Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, BJP leader Rajnath Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, and the then Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The implication is that before 2014, India received little attention, and its global influence significantly increased in just a few years under the current government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This narrative is frequently propagated through pro-government media and WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Ministers have also claimed credit for popularising India's cultural assets globally. For example, Home Minister Amit Shah stated that PM Modi was responsible for popularising Konark's Sun Temple worldwide after leaders photographed themselves there with Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Similarly, claims were made that Yoga gained international recognition due to PM Modi's efforts, culminating in the UN proclaiming June 21st as International Yoga Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Recontextualizing Historical and Cultural Standing

Many of the government's claims regarding India's newfound global recognition are disputed by historical facts:

### The "World Listens to India" Phrase
The statement "When India speaks, the whole world listens" was originally made by former US President Barack Obama in praise of Dr. Manmohan Singh, then India's Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Obama specifically lauded Dr. Singh's deep understanding of economics and acknowledged India's emergence as a superpower before 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Pre-2014 Global Cultural Prominence
Contrary to the narrative of India gaining renown only after 2014, India's cultural influence has been significant globally for decades:

*   **Konark Sun Temple**: It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, long before the Modi government came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Yoga**: While International Yoga Day was proclaimed by the UN in December 2014 due to PM Modi's efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, Yoga itself had a universal appeal long before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Photos from 2013 show Justin Trudeau practicing Mayur Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, and his father, Pierre Trudeau, also practiced it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Baba Ramdev conducted yoga sessions in America as early as 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   The international popularization of Yoga began prominently in the 1950s and 1960s. India's first Prime Minister, [[comparison_of_pm_modi_and_pm_nehrus_international_standing_and_influence | Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]], introduced world-renowned violinist Yehudi Menuhin to Yogacharya B.K.S. Iyengar in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Iyengar subsequently popularized yoga across the world, including Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Swami Vivekananda first introduced yoga spiritually to the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Other gurus like Indira Devi, K. Pattabhi Jois, and Richard Hittleman also contributed to its global spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Indian Spirituality & Meditation**: Swami Vivekananda, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Osho, Paramhansa Yogananda, and Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta significantly contributed to the popularity of Indian spirituality in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The Beatles' visit to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh in 1967-1968, to learn Transcendental Meditation, brought massive global attention to Indian spiritual practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Indian Music**: Pandit Ravi Shankar began international performances in 1954 and was instrumental in popularizing Indian classical music worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He won the first Grammy for an Indian artist for his album *West Meets East* with Yehudi Menuhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Ustad Bismillah Khan also had his first international performance in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Bollywood music and cinema, with stars like Raj Kapoor, Mithun Chakraborty, and Shahrukh Khan, have long been globally popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Indian Cinema**: Filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, and Mira Nair had already gained international acclaim at film festivals before 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Other Global Achievements**: By 2014, Indians had already won numerous international accolades, including Oscars, Nobel Prizes, Booker Prizes, Ramon Magsaysay Awards, and Olympic medals, as well as Cricket World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## The Narrative of "Pre-2014 Shame"
PM [[criticisms_of_modis_claims_and_portrayal | Modi]] and his supporters, including Kangana Ranaut, have suggested that before 2014, Indians lacked cultural confidence and were "ashamed of themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. PM Modi stated in 2015 that people used to believe they had "sinned in their previous life" because they were born in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This portrayal is seen as defaming India's rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Contrasting Current International Perceptions
Despite the claims of enhanced global standing, India's international image and rankings in various indices have declined under the Modi government:

*   **Human Development Index**: India is ranked 134th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Global Peace Index 2023**: India is ranked 126th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Global Hunger Index 2023**: India's rank dropped to 111th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Democracy Index 2023**: India fell to 104th rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Press Freedom Index 2024**: India is ranked 159th, a significant drop compared to 2014 (159th vs 134th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Citizenship Renunciation**: The number of people giving up Indian citizenship broke all records in 2022, with over 225,000 renunciations in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Approximately 97,000 Indians were arrested trying to enter the US illegally in a year (as of November 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Media Portrayal**:
    *   *The New York Times* had to publicly clarify a fake front-page image claiming PM Modi as "the last hope of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
    *   *Time Magazine*, which once featured Modi with "Why Modi Matters" in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, later published a cover in 2019 titled "India's Divider in Chief," highlighting the country's social fabric being torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   International newspapers like Australia's *Herald Sun* and Japan's *Nikkei Asia* have reported on controversial issues such as allegations against a BJP-linked politician for sexual exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> and [[controversies_and_criticism_surrounding_narendra_modi | Modi's speeches against Muslims]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
    *   International media, including CBS News and *The New York Times*, have reported on lynchings in India since 2014, such as the Palghar incident and the death of Tabrez Ansari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Deterioration of International Relations
Relations with neighboring countries are reportedly at a low point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The controversial statements by BJP leaders Nupur Sharma and Naveen Kumar Jindal drew criticism from Middle Eastern countries and led to the UN Secretary General issuing instructions on tolerance for all religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The European Parliament passed a resolution on India's human rights situation last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, and the UN Human Rights Office refused to recognize India's National Human Rights Commission for the second consecutive year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Singapore's Prime Minister expressed concern over criminal charges against MPs in India, contrasting it with the era of [[comparison_of_pm_modi_and_pm_nehrus_international_standing_and_influence | Nehru's India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. America and the UN have also expressed concern over the "fundamentally discriminatory" CAA law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Despite India's objections, Russia sold weapons to Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Historical Comparison of India's Global Leadership

### The Nehru Era
In contrast to the current narrative, India held significant global respect and influence decades before 2014, particularly during the time of Prime Minister [[comparison_of_pm_modi_and_pm_nehrus_international_standing_and_influence | Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]].

*   **Global Welcome**: When Nehru visited America, he was received by the US President at the airport and honored with a 19-gun salute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. US President Harry Truman hailed him as a "respected and loved leader of a great nation of free people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Nehru also received an unprecedented welcome in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Influence Despite Poverty**: Nehru garnered immense global respect despite India being an extremely poor country, recently looted by the British, and not even self-sufficient in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **Non-Alignment Movement (NAM)**: Nehru's policy of peace and non-alignment, deeply rooted in India's past thinking, became a cornerstone of India's foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. The groundwork for NAM began with conferences like the Bandung Conference in 1955, where Nehru argued that Asian and African nations should not be mere "hangers" of Western or Eastern blocs, but leaders of their own ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This stance was challenging, as both the US and Soviet Union sought to influence India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, even offering India a permanent seat in the UN Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Nehru chose to lead a "third group" of non-aligned nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Today, 120 countries are part of NAM, demonstrating its lasting global [[influence_on_indian_media_and_political_environment | influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
*   **Global Statesmen's Admiration**:
    *   Japanese author Tomio Mizokami cited Nehru as the reason he chose to learn Hindi and embrace Indian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
    *   Martin Luther King Jr. described Nehru as a man of "three extraordinary eras," a leader of anti-colonial struggle, and a champion of peace who held onto India's wish for peace amidst Cold War struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. He noted Nehru's reputation, wisdom, and courage as an "honest mediator" for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   Nelson Mandela called Nehru his hero and quoted extensively from his writings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
    *   Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi named Nehru as one of the two Indian leaders she felt closest to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
    *   Mikhail Gorbachev, future Russian leader, was deeply impressed and inspired by Nehru's Moscow tour as a student, stating Nehru left a "deep impression" on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   **Support for Africa**: Nehru openly spoke against apartheid in Africa and created scholarships for African students, leading many to later become prominent leaders in their own countries, such as John Samuel Malecela (Prime Minister of Tanzania), Olusegun Obasanjo (President of Nigeria), and Bingu wa Mutharika (President of Malawi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Current Government's Approach to Culture, Arts, and Science

The current government's approach to culture, arts, and science is also critiqued:

*   **Sports**: Olympic medal-winning wrestlers had to protest for days to file an FIR against a BJP leader accused of sexual exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
*   **Arts & Education**: An actor from B-grade films, Gajendra Chauhan, was appointed chairman of the Film Institute Pune, leading to student protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. Disciplinary action, including stopping grants, was taken against students like Payal Kapadia, who recently brought international acclaim to India by winning the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.
*   **Science**: The removal of evolution from the syllabus and the encouragement of pseudoscience are highlighted as detrimental to India's soft power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Modi government's narrative of India's global emergence after 2014 is challenged by historical facts and current international perceptions. While the government attempts to appropriate past achievements and promote a new image of India, a closer look reveals a long history of global influence that predates 2014. Furthermore, current international indices and media reports suggest a decline in India's standing in areas such as human rights, press freedom, and democratic values.

The constant attempts by the BJP to [[false_narratives_and_media_portrayal_regarding_indias_global_leadership | defame Nehru]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a> are seen as an attempt to elevate the current leadership by pulling down past leaders, rather than striving for self-improvement for the benefit of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

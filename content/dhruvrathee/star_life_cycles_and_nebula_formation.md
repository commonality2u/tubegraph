The [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST) has released "mesmerising, unprecedented photos" that reveal new insights into the universe, including the life cycles of stars and the formation of nebulae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These images provide humanity with a view of the universe never seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Nebulae: Clouds of Dust and Gas

A nebula is defined as a bright area formed by clouds of dust and gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. They can be thought of as large, shiny clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The JWST is uniquely suited to observe these formations due to its primary operation in the infrared spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Infrared light, with its longer wavelengths, can penetrate through gases and clouds more easily than visible light, similar to how radio waves travel through walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The telescope uses two infrared cameras for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>:
*   **Near Infrared Camera (NIRCAM)**: Captures shorter infrared wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI Cam)**: Captures longer infrared wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The view of nebulae can vary significantly between the two cameras, with MIRI Cam often providing a clearer view through dense dust clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Star Death: Planetary Nebula

One of the JWST's photos captures the death of a star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This specific image features two stars orbiting each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The dimmer star is in the process of dying, having released clouds of gases and dust over thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This cloud of gas and dust is known as a **Planetary Nebula** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The orbiting motion of the two stars causes the cloud to be swished around, shaping it due to their gravitational pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

| Camera   | Visibility of Stars | Visibility of Cloud    |
| :------- | :------------------ | :--------------------- |
| NIRCAM   | Only one star visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> | Cloud clearly visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>  |
| MIRI Cam | Two stars clearly visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> | Cloud quite muted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> |

This difference is due to MIRI Cam's ability to capture longer wavelengths, allowing it to see through the dense center of the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### The Sun's Future Life Cycle

Stars, like humans, have a life cycle: childhood, teenage, adulthood, old age, and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Our Sun is also a star, currently in its young stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. In about 5 billion years, our Sun is predicted to become a **Red Giant** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

As a Red Giant, the Sun will expand, swallowing the planets Venus and Mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Earth will no longer be habitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. After this phase, it will also become a planetary nebula, eventually becoming a **White Dwarf** before its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Star Birth: Cosmic Cliffs (Carina Nebula)

Another "most beautiful photo" captured by JWST showcases the birth of stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The image features structures resembling "mountain ranges," which scientists have named "Cosmic Cliffs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This formation is a specific type of nebula called the **Carina Nebula** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

In the star life cycle, a star is born at the stage of a **Stellar Nebula** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The red dots visible within the Cosmic Cliffs image are identified as growing infant stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. These can be observed using both NIRCAM and MIRI Cam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

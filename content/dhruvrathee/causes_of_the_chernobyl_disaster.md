On April 26, 1986, at 1:23 AM, Reactor Number 4 of the [[chernobyl_nuclear_disaster_overview | Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in the Soviet Union experienced a catastrophic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The lid on top of the reactor began shaking, and shockwaves were felt throughout the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Workers realized the nuclear reaction was completely out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> and attempted an emergency shutdown by pressing a button designed to insert control rods and stop the reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. However, this action led to a huge blast, engulfing the reactor in flames and releasing harmful radioactive material into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This event is considered the World's Worst Nuclear Disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Background: Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant

After [[causes_of_world_war_ii | World War II]], the Soviet Union heavily invested in nuclear power plants, including the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Built in the early 1970s, it was considered one of the most advanced nuclear power plants in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Despite its name, it was located about 16 km away from the city of Chernobyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

The plant featured four nuclear reactors of the [[technical_aspects_of_nuclear_reactors | RBMK 1000 design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Each reactor was capable of producing 1,000 Megawatts of electricity, with all four together meeting 10% of Ukraine's electricity demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### How an [[technical_aspects_of_nuclear_reactors | RBMK Reactor]] Works

A nuclear reactor's core is primarily built of three components:
*   **Fuel Rods**: Contain nuclear fuel, typically Uranium Dioxide enriched with Uranium-235 isotope, which undergoes nuclear fission to create energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. When a neutron collides with Uranium-235, it splits into two, releasing more neutrons and kinetic energy, leading to a nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   **Control Rods**: Made of Boron Carbide in the Chernobyl reactors, these rods absorb neutrons to slow down the nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. The more control rods inserted, the slower the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
*   **Moderator**: In the RBMK 1000 design, graphite blocks were used as moderators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. Graphite slows down the energy of neutrons, increasing their chances of colliding with Uranium atoms, thereby speeding up the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. In contrast, most modern nuclear plants use water as a moderator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

Nuclear reactors generate steam by heating water, which then moves turbines to produce electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This water also acts as a coolant to prevent overheating around the reactor, requiring a constant supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Backup diesel generators were in place to ensure water pumps kept working during a power cut, but they took 1-2 minutes to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. For this critical gap, electricity was meant to be sourced from the reactor's residual steam-driven turbines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## The Fatal Safety Test

The disaster occurred in Reactor Number 4 during a routine safety test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The test aimed to verify if the turbines could produce enough electricity to power the water pumps during the 1-2 minute gap before backup generators came online after a power cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. This specific test had been unsuccessful in Reactor 4 previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. The test was delayed by a day, leading to workers being fatigued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Preparations for the test began at 11:10 PM on April 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Sequence of Events Leading to Disaster

1.  **Unexpected Power Drop and Xenon Poisoning**:
    *   Workers were tasked with reducing the reactor's output from 1,600 MW to 700 MW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.
    *   However, as control rods were inserted, the power dropped unexpectedly low, reaching 30 MW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
    *   This was due to a byproduct, Xenon-135, accumulating in the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. Xenon-135, like Boron, efficiently absorbs neutrons, effectively "braking" the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. This accumulation is known as Xenon poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

2.  **Operator Misjudgements and Safety Violations**:
    *   Seeing the low power output, shift supervisor Anatoly ordered workers to remove control rods to speed up the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
    *   By 1:00 AM on April 26, the power reached 200 MW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. Still short of the 700 MW target for the test, Anatoly instructed the removal of even more control rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
    *   Out of 211 control rods, all but 8 were removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. This was a severe violation of safety protocols, which mandated a minimum of 15 control rods in the reactor at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

3.  **Positive Feedback Loop and Extreme Power Surge**:
    *   The drastic removal of control rods at 1:19 AM caused a sudden spike in the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
    *   The increasing power rapidly turned the remaining water in the core into steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.
    *   As water (the coolant) decreased, a positive feedback loop was created: less water meant less cooling, causing the reaction to gain more speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
    *   The increase in reaction speed caused the accumulated Xenon-135 to burn out, removing its neutron-absorbing "braking" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. This led to an extreme power surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>, with the nuclear reaction increasing exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

4.  **Critical Design Flaw in Control Rods**:
    *   At 1:23 AM, recognizing the critical situation, workers pressed the Emergency Stop button to reinsert the control rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.
    *   However, a fatal design flaw existed in the [[technical_aspects_of_nuclear_reactors | RBMK reactor's control rods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. While the main part of the rod was made of boron (a neutron absorber), the tips were made of graphite, the same material used as a moderator to *speed up* the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.
    *   As the control rods were inserted, their graphite tips momentarily displaced water (a weak neutron absorber) and entered the reactor first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. This graphite contact *infinitely sped up* the already accelerating reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.

## The Explosions and Immediate Aftermath

This critical flaw triggered a first blast 6 to 8 seconds after the emergency button was pressed, with the reactor's power output reaching an astonishing 33,000 MW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. This blast caused the reactor core to start melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. A second, even more powerful blast occurred 2-3 seconds later, blowing the 1,000-tonne lid off the structure and releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. The second blast is attributed to the graphite present in the reactor combusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

Two people were killed instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. More than 100 radioactive elements and 5% of the 192 tonnes of Uranium fuel went into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Fire alarms rang at 1:26 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>, and firefighters, unaware of the radioactive nature of the fire, attempted to extinguish it with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. The graphite fire took over 10 days to put out, requiring helicopters to drop thousands of tonnes of clay, sand, boron, and lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. One helicopter crashed during this dangerous operation, killing four people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. Many firefighters developed severe radiation sickness, with 28 passing away within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

## Preventing a Third Explosion

Even after the fire was put out, the reactor continued to produce high levels of heat, causing its base to crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. A significant risk remained because a water tank filled with radioactive water was located directly beneath the reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. If the superheated reactor made contact with this water, it would instantly turn into steam, causing a third, potentially catastrophic explosion that could have rendered most of Europe uninhabitable for 500,000 years and killed millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.

To prevent this, three volunteers — Alexei Ananenko, Valeri Bezpalov, and Boris Baranov — dived into the radioactive water tank on May 4, 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. They located and opened the valves to drain the radioactive water, preventing a third explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>. All three divers survived, though Boris passed away in 2005 from a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

The **Ram Mandir Inauguration in Ayodhya** was a significant event in January 2024, leading to widespread discussion and controversy surrounding the [[metaphorical_and_literal_interpretations_of_the_ramayana | Ramayana]] and its central figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The ceremony, known as Praan Prathistha (establishment of life), involves installing an idol within a temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Context of Ramayana Narratives
Discussions surrounding the Ramayana often involve various perspectives, including:
*   The justification of [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravana]] by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | Allegations against Ram]], such as the killing of Shambhuk (a lower caste person) and the abandonment of his wife Sita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   Evidence suggesting that [[the_addition_of_uttar_kand_to_the_original_ramayana | the Uttar Kaand]] of the Ramayana is a later addition to the original text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This highlights ongoing scholarly debate about [[misinterpretations_and_later_additions_to_the_ramayana | misinterpretations and later additions]] to the epic.
*   Questions about whether the Ramayana is based on a true story or is primarily a literary work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | qualities and principles of Shri Ram]], as described in Valmiki's original Ramayana, are considered valuable lessons applicable to people of all faiths and even atheists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Controversies and Perspectives on the Ram Mandir Event
The inauguration ceremony on January 22, 2024, sparked several debates and points of contention:

#### Political Abstentions
*   **BJP Veterans:** Senior BJP leaders L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, key figures in the Ram Mandir Agitation Movement since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, did not attend. The Ram Temple Trust cited their age as the reason for advising them not to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In contrast, Bollywood celebrities received special invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **CPI(M):** General secretary Sitaram Yechury rejected the invitation, stating that religion is a personal matter and the government should not be affiliated with any particular religion, upholding the principle of secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray Faction):** Uddhav Thackeray received a late invitation via speed post and rejected it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. His party member Sanjay Raut criticized the BJP, stating that while they worship Ram, "they rule like Ravan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Thackeray instead visited the Kalaram Temple in Nashik, a place believed to have hosted Lord Rama, Lakshman, and Sita during their exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This reflects the [[the_shift_in_perception_of_ravan_in_modern_times | shifting perception of Ravan]] in political discourse.
*   **Congress Party:** Many Congress leaders rejected the invitation, citing that the temple was being inaugurated while only partially completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Their primary reason was the perceived politicization of the event by the BJP, using Ram's name for electoral gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This stance was praised by some as a good decision and criticized by others as a political blunder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

#### Shankaracharyas' Concerns
The four principal Shankaracharyas, heads of the four Mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya approximately 1,200 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, all abstained from the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Puri Shankaracharya, Nischalananda Saraswati**, stated the ceremony was not in accordance with Hindu scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Uttarakhand Shankaracharya, Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati**, explained that bringing life into an incomplete temple (likened to a body without eyes or head) goes against scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. He refused to attend due to these violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

#### Defamation and Misinformation
The Shankaracharyas, particularly Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, faced relentless defamation on social media, with false news spread by IT cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Fake Photo Allegations:** Pictures were circulated claiming he visited Ajmer Sharif, a Muslim pilgrimage site, to label him "anti-Hindu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This was debunked; the photo was from a Hindu Ashram (Ramdev Pir's court, considered a Krishna avatar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. He also confirmed in an interview he had never been to Ajmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   Adi Shankaracharya's core philosophy of non-duality (Aham Brahmasmi – God is present everywhere) suggests that visiting a mosque, Gurudwara, or Church would not be contradictory to his teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Bribery Allegations:** False news claimed Shankaracharyas took ₹500,000 to reject the invitation, a baseless accusation without evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
This reflects a trend where dissent against the ruling party or Prime Minister Modi leads to defamation and insult, with an "army of incels" determining who is "Hindu" and "anti-Hindu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. These groups, it is argued, are more interested in political exploitation of Ram's name than in his principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Ram's Character as a Historical and Moral Ideal
The text contrasts historical figures often called "Great" with the character of Ram, highlighting the importance of principles over power:
*   **Alexander the Great:** Despite his title, Alexander was a "bloodthirsty, short-tempered, alcoholic, ego-maniac, ruthless king who killed hundreds of thousands of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Lord Ram's Reaction to Exile:** When Ram was about to be crowned king, his stepmother Kaikeyi demanded her son Bharat be king and Ram be exiled for 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
    *   According to Ayodhya Kand, Chapter 18, Shloka 41, Ram was "not upset to hear this" despite Kaikeyi's harsh words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
    *   Chapter 19, Shloka 1, states he "did not get angry" and was unruffled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
    *   He consoled his father Dashratha and assured Kaikeyi he would go into exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   This is contrasted with historical rulers like Ashok and Aurangzeb, who killed their brothers for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   Despite popular support in Ayodhya (Chapter 17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, Ram chose not to use force or manipulate the situation to become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   Shloka 15 describes Rama as virtuous and compassionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   In Chapter 19, Shloka 20, Rama tells Kaikeyi he is not concerned with wealth, desiring to be a sage "abiding in righteousness alone" and serving people through power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

The narrative emphasizes that losing something while protecting one's morality is not a true loss, while gaining something by sacrificing morality is not a true win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Ram's actions embody humility, compassion, and forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This highlights how [[historical_interpretations_and_biases | historical interpretations and biases]] can shape perceptions of leadership and morality.

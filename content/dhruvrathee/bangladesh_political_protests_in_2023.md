In mid-2024, Bangladesh experienced widespread and violent political protests, leading to the shutdown of schools and colleges nationwide, suspension of mobile internet services, and the declaration of a military curfew in parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Initially peaceful, these demonstrations turned violent, resulting in at least 150 deaths and thousands of injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Protesters began labeling Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina a "dictator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Causes of the Protests: The Quota System

The primary driver behind the [[quota_system_controversy_in_bangladesh | protests]] is the government's public sector [[quota_system_controversy_in_bangladesh | quota system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Under this system, 56% of government jobs are reserved for various societal groups, leaving only 44% for merit-based appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The breakdown of the quota system includes:
*   **30%** for the descendants of [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **10%** for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **10%** "Zila Quota" for residents of backward districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **5%** for ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **1%** for people with physical disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

The 30% quota for [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighters]]' descendants forms the largest share of the reserved positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Students demand the removal of all reservations except those for ethnic minorities and people with physical disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Historical Context of the Quota System

The quota system for [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighters]] was first introduced in 1972, a year after Bangladesh gained independence, initially for the [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighters]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This was later extended to their children in 1997 and then to their grandchildren in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Prior Protests and Legal Developments

Opposition to the quota system has existed for years. A significant movement against it occurred in 2012-13, following the extension of the quota to grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. In February 2018, the Bangladesh's General Students' Rights Conservation Council demanded reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Under pressure, the government in October 2018 issued a circular removing the quota for first and second-class jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

However, in 2021, seven students from [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighters]]' families petitioned the High Court against this removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. On June 5, 2024, the High Court declared the government's circular illegal, thereby reintroducing the quota system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This decision reignited the current wave of [[quota_system_controversy_in_bangladesh | protests]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

On July 10, 2024, the Supreme Court imposed a stay on the High Court's order, but this did not halt the [[quota_system_controversy_in_bangladesh | protests]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Subsequently, on July 21, the Supreme Court ruled that the [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighter]] descendants' quota should be reduced to 5%, and other quotas for ethnic minorities, transgenders, and disabled people to 2%, limiting the total reservation to 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Constitutional and Corruption Allegations

Protesting students claim the quota is unconstitutional, arguing that the original constitution did not stipulate job reservations for future generations of [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. There are also allegations of corruption within the system, particularly concerning the identification of [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Protesters claim the ruling Awami League disproportionately benefits from the [[quota_system_controversy_in_bangladesh | reservation]], with over 60,000 objections raised against names on the [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighter]] list remaining unresolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Government Response and PM Hasina's Remarks

The government has deployed over 7,000 paramilitary troops to confront protesters, using tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound grenades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The United Nations Secretary-General issued a statement advising the government to refrain from violence against protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Clashes have also occurred between protesters and the Bangladesh's Student League, the student wing of the Awami League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

While the Law Minister stated the government's willingness to talk and push for an early Supreme Court hearing, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made controversial remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. She questioned why protesters "hate the [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighters]]" and insinuated that if [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | freedom fighters]]' grandchildren didn't get benefits, then "grandchildren of the 'Razakars'" would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The term "Razakar" refers to a paramilitary group that supported the West Pakistan army during the [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War]], encouraging and participating in atrocities against the people of East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. In Bangladesh, "Razakar" signifies a traitor and anti-national <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Underlying Issues: Unemployment and Economic Struggles

Beyond the [[quota_system_controversy_in_bangladesh | quota system]], the protests are seen as a symptom of deeper [[economic_challenges_and_unemployment_in_bangladesh | unemployment challenges]] in Bangladesh, similar to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Over 500,000 government jobs are vacant, yet 1.8 to 1.9 million young people enter the job market annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Out of a working population of 110 million, 30 million are unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Bangladesh's economy faces difficulties, including low foreign exchange reserves, leading to requests for aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and potential loans from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Inflation rates are also high, at 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. These [[economic_challenges_and_unemployment_in_bangladesh | economic struggles]], coupled with accusations of electoral rigging following Prime Minister Hasina's fourth consecutive term in January 2024, contribute to the widespread discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

A [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] is defined as a region in space where the force of gravity is so strong that not even light can escape it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>. From the outside, it is impossible to discern what lies within a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. While the name "black hole" might sound sensational, it is somewhat misleading, as there is no actual "hole" in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:35">[06:35:35]</a>. [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | Black holes]] are formed from [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | stars]] and contain material at their center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:47">[06:47:47]</a>.

## Formation of Black Holes

[[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | Stars]], including our Sun, maintain equilibrium throughout their lives due to a balance between the outward force from continuous nuclear fusion reactions (producing heat and light) and the inward pull of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:51">[06:51:51]</a>. This fusion process relies on fuel like Hydrogen or Helium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:21">[07:21:21]</a>. When a [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | star]] exhausts its fuel, the outward force ceases, allowing the gravitational force to cause the [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | star]] to collapse in on itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:27">[07:27:27]</a>. The ultimate fate of the [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | star]] depends on its mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:46">[07:46:46]</a>.

For a massive [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | star]], when it runs out of fuel, it cools down and transforms into a Red Super Giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:02">[08:02:02]</a>. This Super Giant then explodes into a Super Nova, leaving behind a tiny core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>. If this core is larger than a Neutron [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | Star]], it becomes a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | Black Hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:15">[08:15:15]</a>. Essentially, if the mass of a [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | star]] collapses and becomes sufficiently small and condensed, it can form a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:22">[08:22:22]</a>. For instance, if a [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | star]] the size of our Sun were to become a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]], its diameter would be merely 50 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:35">[08:35:35]</a>. However, our Sun will not become a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]], a fact proven by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's Chandrasekhar Limit, which states that a White Dwarf's maximum mass is 1.4 times that of our Sun, beyond which it would become a Neutron [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | Star]] or a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | Black Hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:46">[08:46:46]</a>.

## Types of Black Holes

There are primarily three to four types of [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black holes]]:

### Stellar Black Hole
This is the most common type of [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]], formed from the collapse of [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | stars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:18">[09:18:18]</a>. Scientists estimate that the [[galaxy_formation_and_gravitational_lensing | Milky Way Galaxy]] alone contains between 10 million and 1 billion such [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:24">[09:24:24]</a>.

### Primordial Black Hole
These [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black holes]] are hypothesized to be as small as an atom but possess the mass of a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:30">[09:30:30]</a>. Primordial [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black holes]] are currently only theoretical and hypothetical, with much still unknown about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:44">[09:44:44]</a>.

### Supermassive Black Hole
These are enormous [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black holes]], with a mass greater than that of 1 million Suns combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:53">[09:53:53]</a>. Their diameter can be as large as our entire Solar System <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:59">[09:59:59]</a>. It is believed that every major [[galaxy_formation_and_gravitational_lensing | galaxy]] has a Supermassive [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | Black Hole]] at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:04">[10:04:04]</a>. For example, the Supermassive [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | Black Hole]] at the center of our [[galaxy_formation_and_gravitational_lensing | Milky Way Galaxy]] is named Sagittarius A*=ss.ss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:09">[10:09:09]</a>. The [[black_holes_and_their_representation_in_movies | black hole]] depicted in the film [[black_holes_and_their_representation_in_movies | *Interstellar*]], named Gargantua, was also a Supermassive [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | Black Hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:14">[10:14:14]</a>.

### Intermediate Black Hole
Scientists also speculate about a fourth type, the Intermediate [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | Black Hole]], which would fall in size between [[stellar black hole | Stellar]] and [[supermassive black hole | Supermassive black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:21">[10:21:21]</a>. However, there is no definitive proof of their existence yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:36">[10:36:36]</a>.

## Characteristics and Components of Black Holes

Contrary to some interpretations, a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] is not merely a large black ball that sucks everything in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:46">[10:46:46]</a>. They possess distinct features:

### Accretion Disk
Around a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]], an orange-colored ring known as the Accretion Disk forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:06">[11:06:06]</a>. Due to the intense gravitational pull, gaseous matter and debris are attracted and revolve around the [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] at very high speeds, similar to planets orbiting the Sun but far more powerfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:14">[11:14:14]</a>. This material heats up, becoming a fluid-like matter hotter than a million degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:38">[11:38:38]</a>. The particles rub together and become compressed, causing them to glow and emit electromagnetic radiation, primarily X-rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:54">[11:54:54]</a>. The [[black_holes_and_their_representation_in_movies | *Interstellar*]] film accurately depicted this disk, though its true color is closer to blue, as human eyes cannot see the X-rays emitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:06">[12:06:06]</a>. The first photo of a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]], taken in 2019, also used a yellowish-orange color to represent this disk for visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:28">[12:28:28]</a>. One side of the disk often appears brighter due to the Doppler Beaming effect, indicating particles spinning towards the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:43">[12:43:43]</a>. The Accretion Disk also creates an optical illusion, appearing to cover the top and bottom of the [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] due to gravity bending light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:18">[13:18:18]</a>.

### Photonsphere
As one approaches a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]], a last circle of light, the Photonsphere, becomes visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:54">[13:54:54]</a>. In this region, gravity is so strong that photons (light particles) begin to orbit the [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:59">[13:59:59]</a>. Theoretically, if a person reached this area alive, they might be able to see the back of their own head because light travels in a circle, forming a ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:09">[14:09:09]</a>.

### Event Horizon
Beyond the Photonsphere lies the boundary of the [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]], known as the Event Horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:23">[14:23:23]</a>. This is considered a point of no return because beyond it, gravity is so overwhelming that even light cannot escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:27">[14:27:27]</a>. If one crosses the Event Horizon, escape is theoretically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:39">[14:39:39]</a>. The depiction in [[black_holes_and_their_representation_in_movies | *Interstellar*]] of Cooper falling into a five-dimensional space after crossing the Event Horizon is purely imaginative, as the interior of the Event Horizon remains unknown to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:50">[14:50:50]</a>.

### Singularity
At the very center of a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] is the Singularity, a region where the curvature of space-time is infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:25">[15:25:25]</a>. According to [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein's General Theory of Relativity]], the space-time fabric is bent infinitely by the immense mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:43">[15:43:43]</a>. As gravitational force increases, time is believed to slow down infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:02">[16:02:02]</a>. The exact implications of this for someone falling into a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] are unknown, and there are only theories about what happens beyond the Event Horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:19">[16:19:19]</a>. One theory suggests that inside the Event Horizon, light might reflect at multiple points before reaching the Singularity, making things visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:30">[16:30:30]</a>.

The practical existence of [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black holes]] was proven by the first photo taken by the Event Horizon telescope on April 10, 2019, about 100 years after they were theoretically predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:47">[16:47:47]</a>. However, it is certain that if a human were to fall into a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]], they would disintegrate into pieces due to gravitational forces and die within milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:06">[17:06:06]</a>. Despite this, there is no need to fear [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black holes]]; they do not "suck up" all matter endlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:17">[17:17:17]</a>. Just as planets orbit the Sun, planetary bodies and [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | stars]] within a [[galaxy_formation_and_gravitational_lensing | galaxy]] orbit the Supermassive [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | Black Hole]] at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:28">[17:28:28]</a>. Maintaining a proper distance from a [[scientific_and_theoretical_aspects_of_black_holes | black hole]] ensures safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:49">[17:49:49]</a>.

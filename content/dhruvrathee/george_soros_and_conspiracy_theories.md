George Soros, a Hungarian-American billionaire, investor, hedge fund manager, short seller, and philanthropist, is frequently the subject of various [[conspiracy_theories_about_the_moon_landing|conspiracy theories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, particularly spread through "WhatsApp University" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. These theories often combine elements like the Illuminati, New World Order, Pakistan, China, America, Communism, and various "gangs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Allegations and Debunking

### Funding to Overthrow Government
One prominent [[election_strategies_and_brainwashing_tactics|conspiracy theory]] suggests that George Soros has invested billions to "overthrow a patriotic PM like Modi, and the entire government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

However, a deeper look into George Soros reveals a different picture:
*   He is known for shaking the Bank of England with his short selling in 1992, earning a billion dollars profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   In 1997, his shorting of Thai and Malaysian currencies contributed to a financial crisis in those countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   He has expressed that "laissez-faire capitalism" (without government regulations) is a threat to "open society," which he defines as a world with democratic governance, freedom of expression, and respect for individual rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   To promote an open society, he established his Open Society Foundation, which operates in 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Open Society Foundation in India
The Open Society Foundation established its presence in India in 1999, during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's premiership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   Initially, it provided scholarships and fellowships for research and study in Indian institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   From 2014, it began India-specific grant-making, supporting local organizations in areas like community living for people with disabilities, public services, rights strengthening, justice system reforms, and medicine access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   Its social impact investments have funded ventures like Neo Growth and Capital Float (renamed Axio in 2022), which have provided around $300 million in affordable financing to over 40,000 small businesses in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   The founders of Capital Float, Gaurav Hinduja and Shashank Rishyasringa, have verifiable links to BJP leaders, including Kapil Mishra, Lal Krishan Advani, and Devendra Fadnavis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This suggests direct links between Soros's funded ventures and BJP figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   An investigation by the Indian Express revealed that 68 of George Soros's Open Society Foundation projects worldwide are funded by the UN Democracy Fund, to which India is the fourth-highest contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This implies that the Modi government indirectly funds George Soros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### Views on Other Nations and Social Issues
George Soros's public statements also counter common narratives about him:
*   He views China's President Xi Jinping as the "most dangerous opponent for open societies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   He has called for a crackdown on China's high-tech companies and criticized China's Belt and Road Initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   In 2017, he ordered the closure of the Open Society Foundation's Pakistan branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   He has made efforts to end racism and spoken against income inequality in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   He advocated for a 2%-3% wealth tax on rich individuals (those with over $50 million) instead of taxing the middle class and poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### The "Problem": Criticizing PM Modi
The perceived "problem" with George Soros, from the perspective of his critics, appears to stem from his public expression of concerns over "India's eroding democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a> and his criticism of Narendra Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. He commented on the "suspicious relationship" between Gautam Adani and PM Modi, stating that Modi needs to address the Adani crisis to retain foreign investor trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. According to some narratives, criticizing PM Modi is equated with being "anti-India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Fabricated Connections and Disinformation

Certain YouTubers, like Elvish Yadav, have been accused of fabricating connections between George Soros and other individuals to spread [[claims_of_spreading_hatred_and_misinformation|misinformation]]:

### Fori Nehru (Rahul Gandhi's Aunt)
It was claimed that George Soros and Rahul Gandhi's aunt, Fori Nehru, were "close acquaintances" and that she was a "threat to our nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   Fori Nehru passed away in 2017 at the age of 108 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   She was from Hungary and, like Soros, was Jewish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   An article from 2009 titled "Mr Soros goes to meet an old friend" was used in 2023 by right-wing websites as "breaking news" to suggest a current threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

### Amrit Singh (Former PM Manmohan Singh's Daughter)
Similar tactics were used to spread lies about former PM Dr. Manmohan Singh's daughter, Amrit Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
*   An article from 2013 reported that she was awarded for her work in human rights law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   Her report, "Globalising Torture: CIA Secret Torture and Extraordinary Rendition," detailed cases of people detained and tortured across 54 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   She worked with the Open Society Justice Initiative, which published the report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   Seven years later, pro-BJP websites republished this old news as "piping hot breaking news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, despite her no longer working with the Open Society Foundation, and now being a law professor at Stanford University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

### Harsh Mander
Harsh Mander, a former IAS officer and author, was labeled "anti-national" based on alleged connections to George Soros's Open Society Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a> and claims that his videos on CAA and Manipur were inspired by Mander's tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   Mander is noted for his extensive work in public service, including contributions to drafting significant bills like the Right to Information and Food Security Bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, and his campaign against lynchings, Karwan-e-Mohabbat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   The claim of being inspired by Mander's tweets was debunked by showing earlier publication dates for the video content than the alleged tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
*   A false connection was made between Harsh Mander and a man named "Aadil Aman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, claiming Aadil moved to Germany and worked for Mander's NGO. This was disproven by showing that two different individuals named Aadil Aman were confused due to misspellings and false associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. The Aadil Aman in Germany has sent a legal notice for defamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   An article about Captain Harmandar Singh, a decorated officer who helped the Dalai Lama, was erroneously presented as evidence against Harsh Mander, confusing their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. Harsh Mander is the son of Captain Harmandar Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

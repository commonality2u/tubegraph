The release of the film "The Kerala Story" has sparked considerable discussion due to its controversial claims about a "secret plot" in Kerala [00:00:00]. The film alleges that innocent women are forcefully converted to Islam and then sent to IS*S, claiming this has affected approximately 32,000 girls now "buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen" [00:00:09].

## Propaganda Techniques Employed

The narrative of "The Kerala Story" appears to utilize established propaganda techniques:

*   **The Big Lie**: Coined by Adolf Hitler, this technique involves telling a lie so outrageous that people assume no one would invent such a fabrication, leading them to believe there must be some truth to it [00:00:48]. The director of the film initially stated the number of affected girls was 32,000 [00:00:18], a figure later exposed as a "Big Lie" [00:11:00].
*   **Repetition**: Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, emphasized the importance of repeating a "big lie" multiple times from various sources to increase its believability [00:01:18]. This is evident in the repeated claims within the film and its promotion.
*   **Half-Truth**: This technique involves incorporating elements of truth into speeches or narratives to lend credibility, especially for those who might be skeptical of outright lies [00:01:31]. The film's director used half-truths by selectively citing public statements and news reports [00:02:52].

## Deconstructing "The Kerala Story" Claims

The film's director, Sudipto Sen, cited several "true incidents" as inspiration [00:02:02]:

1.  **Oommen Chandy's Statement**: The director pointed to a 2010 statement by former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in the state assembly [00:02:11]. An India Today report from 2012 stated that between 2006 and 2012, 2,667 women converted to Islam in Kerala [00:03:01]. However, Chandy never used the term "forced conversions" and explicitly stated his government would not tolerate hate campaigns against Muslims or accusations of "Love Jihad" [00:03:20]. No mention was made of these women joining IS*S [00:03:33].
2.  **V.S. Achuthanandan's Comment**: The director cited former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan's alleged statement that "Kerala is going to become an Islamic state in the next 20 years" [00:02:26]. The circulating video of this statement, uploaded by the film's production company, Sunshine Pictures, has "messed with the English subtitles," misrepresenting Achuthanandan's actual criticism of the Popular Front of India (PFI) for allegedly trying to influence youth by paying them to marry Muslim women [00:03:52]. Again, IS*S was not mentioned [00:04:13]. Furthermore, 13 years later, Kerala remains a "safe and secular" state [00:04:15].
3.  **Fatima in Afghanistan's Jail**: The film's teaser features a girl claiming to be "Fatima" imprisoned in Afghanistan [00:02:40]. A June 2021 Hindu article discussed four women from Kerala who went to Afghanistan with their husbands to join the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) between 2016 and 2018, whose husbands were later killed [00:04:25]. These women include Nimisha alias Fathima Isa, Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha, Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam, and Reffeala [00:04:37].

### Real Statistics vs. Film Claims

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) list from 2016 identified 20 most wanted Indians in IS*S, including these four women and two others, Ajmala and Shamasia [00:04:47]. Of these six women, three were already Muslims, two converted from Christianity, and only one, Nimisha Nair, converted from Hinduism [00:05:04]. Nimisha's husband, Eeza, had converted to Islam from Christianity, as did his brother Bestin, who was also married to one of the four women [00:05:22]. Both brothers and their wives were converts and were radicalized [00:05:38].

Interviews with Nimisha, Sonia Sebastian, and Reffeala in 2020 show them as "brainwashed and radicalized," in contrast to the "helplessness and innocence" portrayed in the film [00:05:56].

Reports indicate that 17 of the 20 individuals on the 2016 NIA chargesheet linked to radicalization came from a single district, Kasaragod in Kerala [00:07:00]. By 2018, 60 Indians had traveled to Afghanistan to join IS*S, including 26 males, 13 women, and 21 children [00:07:41].

### The "Big Lie" of 32,000

While there is a problem of [[isis_recruitment_and_radicalization_in_india | radicalization and recruitment into IS*S]] in India [00:07:52], the scale claimed by "The Kerala Story" is a "Big Lie" [00:11:00].

*   Globally, the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism estimated nearly 40,000 foreign terrorist fighters from 110 countries went to Syria and Iraq [00:08:26].
*   A 2018 King's College London study estimated 41,490 IS*S affiliates from 80 countries [00:08:42].
*   US Bureau of Counter-Terrorism reports indicated 160 IS*S-related arrests by NIA in India by September 2020 [00:09:06].
*   The Observer Research Foundation (ORF) estimated 180-200 pro-IS*S cases in India between 2014 and 2018, including propagandists [00:09:24].
*   The Indian Home Ministry reported 155 such cases in 2019 [00:09:46].
*   Out of these, around 40 cases were from Kerala [00:09:56].
*   The US Department of State reported only **66** known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with IS*S as of November 2020 [00:10:15].
*   Of these 66, approximately 13 were women [00:10:34], and only 6 women were from Kerala [00:10:36].
*   Of the 6 women from Kerala, only 3 converted from other religions [00:10:41] (2 Christians, 1 Hindu) [00:10:46].

Therefore, the film's events are based on the experiences of **three** women, not 32,000, and not in the manner portrayed [00:10:50]. This exaggeration serves to generalize and defame the entire state of Kerala [00:11:42].

## The "Love Jihad" Conspiracy Theory

"The Kerala Story" propagates the concept of "Love Jihad," alleging forceful religious conversions [00:17:19]. However, official investigations have debunked this claim:

*   In 2017, the Kerala government submitted 90 cases to the NIA to investigate a "Love Jihad" angle. The NIA examined 11 cases and concluded in 2018 that while PFI facilitated conversions, **not a single case** involved forced conversion [00:17:28].
*   In 2020, the Union Home Ministry stated in Lok Sabha that "no case of Love Jihad has been reported by any central agency" [00:17:55].

This conspiracy theory is a "Big Lie" [00:18:10] that is repeatedly spread through political speeches, WhatsApp forwards, and propaganda news channels [00:18:14]. The narrative also inherently demeans women by suggesting they can be easily manipulated [00:18:37].

Regarding overall religious conversions in India, data shows a balance:
*   A 2021 report from Kerala showed 506 people registered to change their religion, with 47% converting from Christianity or Islam to Hinduism [00:19:47].
*   A 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that only 0.7% of people left Hinduism for other religions, while 0.8% left other religions to adopt Hinduism [00:20:02].

## India's Resilience Against IS*S

Compared to other countries, India has remarkably low numbers of IS*S recruits despite having the world's third-largest Muslim population [00:13:30].

*   India has a ratio of 0.5 IS*S recruits per million people, significantly lower than France (18 per million), Belgium (40 per million), and Jordan (315 per million) [00:14:15].

Several factors contribute to this:
*   **Superb Response by Indian Agencies**: Operations like "Operation Pigeon" by the NIA and IB identified 350 vulnerable Malayali youth and conducted de-radicalization programs [00:14:44].
*   **India's Syncretic Culture**: Former diplomat Talmiz Ahmad attributes this to India's "unity in diversity," where Muslims live harmoniously with Hindus and Christians, rejecting extreme ideologies [00:15:44]. IS*S itself reportedly considered Indian recruits inferior due to India's "soft" and "liberal version of Islam" [00:16:01].
*   **Positive Role of Muslim Clerics**: In March 2009, Darul Uloom Deoband issued a fatwa declaring India as Dar al-Aman (a country where militant Jihad is prohibited) [00:16:16]. In 2015, 70,000 Indian Muslim scholars issued a joint fatwa against IS*S, Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations [00:16:26].

## Political Exploitation

Despite these facts, politicians are observed engaging in [[misuse_of_communal_narratives_for_political_gain | misuse of communal narratives for political gain]] by promoting "films of lies" [00:15:16]. The Prime Minister has promoted "The Kerala Story" in election speeches [00:15:11]. The Home Minister Amit Shah also alluded to Kerala's supposed dangers during election campaigning in Karnataka [00:17:06].

Such actions are part of a "dirty game" aimed at provoking Hindus, Muslims, and Christians into conflict for political power [00:20:18]. This tactic has evolved from WhatsApp forwards to propaganda media and now to propaganda films, drawing parallels to Hitler's regime which produced films to distort history, defame Jews, and glorify German Aryans [00:20:44].

The true "Kerala story" is one of pride, showcasing unity in diversity, peaceful coexistence, and leading indicators in education, healthcare, and human development [00:16:37].

For a truthful depiction of IS*S recruitment, viewers are encouraged to watch "The Caliphate," a Swedish TV series on Netflix, which portrays how IS*S recruited young girls in Sweden without spreading lies or propaganda [00:21:34].

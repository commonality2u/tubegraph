The legend of the Yeti, often referred to as the "Abominable Snowman," has captivated imaginations for thousands of years, with stories even predating the Pre-Buddhist era [00:00:22 | 00:00:25 | 00:07:54 | 00:07:56]. While numerous expeditions and alleged sightings have fueled its mystery, scientific investigations increasingly point towards known animal species as the true source of these tales.

## The Yeti Myth and Its Characteristics

Stories about the Yeti are thousands of years old [00:00:22]. Some are even from the Pre-Buddhist era, passed down through generations [00:00:25 | 00:07:56]. In the Himalayas, certain societies and religions used to worship this "Glacier Being" [00:08:00 | 00:08:02]. The term "Yeti" itself originates from the Tibetan language, specifically the Sherpa words "Yeh + Teh," meaning "cliff-dwelling bear" or "a bear that lives among the rocks" [00:06:40 | 00:06:41 | 00:06:44 | 00:06:47 | 00:06:49].

According to those who claim to have seen a Yeti, it is described as a large ape-like creature, bigger than humans, standing 7-8 feet tall and weighing 90-180 kg [00:05:21 | 00:05:25 | 00:05:28 | 00:05:33 | 00:05:36]. Common features include long arms, a strong chest and abdomen, and a body covered with long reddish-brown or grey-black fur, except for its face [00:05:30 | 00:05:31 | 00:05:41 | 00:05:42]. It is said to walk upright on two legs, but also use its hands and legs to swing from tree to tree in the jungle [00:05:50 | 00:05:52]. Allegedly, it cannot twist its body or look back [00:05:47 | 00:05:48], carries a large stone as a weapon [00:05:57 | 00:06:00], communicates by whistling [00:06:09 | 00:06:12], and emits a terrible smell [00:06:12]. Yetis are usually seen alone or in pairs, rarely in groups [00:06:04 | 00:06:08]. They are often viewed as harbingers of bad times and death [00:06:18 | 00:06:20].

Yeti stories indicate its presence in the Himalayan mountains of India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Tibet, particularly in Nepal and Tibet, where it lives in high snowy areas [00:06:21 | 00:06:22 | 00:06:25 | 00:06:28].

### Historical and Cultural Accounts of the Yeti

[[historical_and_cultural_accounts_of_the_yeti]] stories about Yeti are actually thousands of years old [00:00:22]. Some are even from the Pre-Buddhist era, passed down for generations [00:00:25 | 00:07:56].

*   **Ancient Legends**: Mani Kabum, a 12th-century Tibetan religious text, describes a mythological story connecting humans and Yetis [00:06:51 | 00:06:55 | 00:06:58]. In this tale, a Bodhisattva monkey married a rock-ogress named Sinmo, leading to six monkey-human children [00:07:01 | 00:07:08 | 00:07:12 | 00:07:31 | 00:07:34]. Their lineage evolved into humans, but previous generations, including Yetis, were not fully human [00:07:37 | 00:07:40 | 00:07:42 | 00:07:45]. This implies shared ancestors, with the Yeti unable to fully evolve into a human [00:07:48 | 00:07:51].
*   **Alexander the Great**: Centuries ago, Yeti stories were so renowned that when Alexander the Great conquered parts of India in 326 BC, he asked to see a Yeti [00:08:21 | 00:08:23 | 00:08:25 | 00:08:30]. Locals reportedly refused, stating Yetis could only survive on high mountains and could not be brought to lower altitudes [00:08:32 | 00:08:35 | 00:08:38].
*   **Early Modern Sightings**:
    *   **1832**: British naturalist Brian Hodgson wrote about encountering a giant, non-human creature covered in long black fur that ran away when discovered [00:08:42 | 00:08:47 | 00:08:49 | 00:08:53 | 00:08:56 | 00:09:00]. He identified it as an orangutan, though orangutans are not native to India [00:09:01 | 00:09:05 | 00:09:08 | 00:09:10].
    *   **1889**: British Army Physician Major LA Waddell observed footprints on Himalayan glaciers that looked like a hominid species but disappeared at the peak [00:09:12 | 00:09:14 | 00:09:19 | 00:09:26 | 00:09:28 | 00:09:30].
    *   **1921**: Climber Charles Howard-Bury and his team reported huge footprints near Mount Everest to an English newspaper [00:09:43 | 00:09:46 | 00:09:47 | 00:09:49 | 00:09:52]. Local guides identified them as "Metoh Kangmi," meaning "Man-Bear Snow-Man" [00:09:54 | 00:09:59]. A journalist's mistranslation of "Metoh" from "Man-Bear" to "Filthy," later changed to "Abominable," coined the term "Abominable Snowman" [00:10:02 | 00:10:05 | 00:10:08 | 00:10:09 | 00:10:11 | 00:10:15].
*   **1937**: Seven expeditions encountered Yeti-like footprints, with two claiming to have seen a Yeti [00:00:10 | 00:10:34 | 00:10:35 | 00:10:39 | 00:10:41]. Explorer HW Tilman and British Army Officer John Hunt both reported seeing Yeti footprints on Zemu Glacier at high altitudes [00:10:22 | 00:10:27 | 00:10:30].

## Investigations and Alleged Evidence

[[expeditions_and_investigations_into_yeti_sightings]] to find the Yeti intensified after a famous photo taken in 1951 [00:05:00 | 00:11:33 | 00:11:35].

*   **Eric Shipton's Photo (1951)**: British Mountaineer Eric Shipton and surgeon Michael Ward, while seeking an alternative route to Mount Everest, spotted large footprints at Menlung glacier [00:04:18 | 00:04:21 | 00:04:23 | 00:04:26 | 00:04:30]. These 13-inch long, 8-inch wide prints resembled human feet but were much larger [00:04:34 | 00:04:37 | 00:04:39]. Shipton photographed them with an axe for scale, and the photos gained worldwide popularity, considered strong evidence of the Yeti's existence [00:04:40 | 00:04:43 | 00:04:45 | 00:04:46 | 00:04:47 | 00:04:51 | 00:04:53].
*   **Pangboche Monastery Relics**: Locals claimed that the Pangboche Monastery held a Yeti's skull [00:00:00 | 00:00:02 | 00:11:52].
    *   In 1953, a *Daily Mail* expedition visited the monastery and took a hair sample from the alleged Yeti's skull [00:11:57 | 00:11:58 | 00:12:00]. Analysis claimed it was neither human nor animal hair, nor even hair at all [00:12:02 | 00:12:04 | 00:12:07 | 00:12:09].
    *   Peter Byrne, an Irish-American explorer, spent 38 months in the Himalayas across five expeditions searching for Yeti [00:16:18 | 00:16:22 | 00:16:24 | 00:16:27]. He visited Pangboche Monastery, which claimed to have Yeti hands and a skull [00:16:28 | 00:16:30 | 00:16:33]. He smuggled a finger from the alleged Yeti's hand, obtained through a donation, into London with actor James Stewart's help [00:16:36 | 00:16:39 | 00:16:45 | 00:16:48 | 00:16:50 | 00:16:52 | 00:16:54 | 00:16:59 | 00:17:01]. Professor William Osman Hill analyzed it, concluding it was human [00:17:04 | 00:17:08 | 00:17:11].
*   **Tom Slick's Expeditions (1957-1959)**: American oilman and millionaire Tom Slick conducted multiple expeditions in East Nepal, finding Yeti footprints and hair strands [00:12:16 | 00:12:19 | 00:12:23 | 00:12:26 | 00:12:30 | 00:12:33]. He used bloodhounds trained on mountain lions and bears [00:12:34 | 00:12:37 | 00:12:39]. He studied two skulls and mummified hands believed to be Yeti remains in four monasteries [00:12:40 | 00:12:42 | 00:12:46]. After his research, he suggested there might be three types of Yetis: one supernatural and two real, with one real type matching Eric Shipton's descriptions [00:00:34 | 00:00:37 | 00:12:48 | 00:12:50 | 00:12:53 | 00:12:54 | 00:12:55 | 00:12:57 | 00:13:03]. Slick died in a plane crash before presenting his full findings [00:13:08 | 00:13:11].
*   **Government Regulations (1959)**: Due to the Yeti craze, the US and Nepal governments established regulations [00:15:06 | 00:15:09 | 00:15:11].
    *   A royalty fee of 5000 Indian Rupees was charged for a Yeti search permit [00:15:14 | 00:15:17 | 00:15:18 | 00:15:21].
    *   Hunting Yeti was banned, though killing in self-defense was excusable [00:15:25 | 00:15:27 | 00:15:31]. Captured Yetis had to be surrendered to the Nepali government [00:15:34 | 00:15:37].
    *   All Yeti-related reports required the Nepali government's permission before being released to the press [00:15:40 | 00:15:43 | 00:15:46 | 00:15:48].
    *   These regulations were formed because both the Nepali and American governments believed the Yeti could be real [00:00:28 | 00:00:30 | 00:00:33 | 00:15:58 | 00:16:00].
*   **Indian Army Tweet (2019)**: On April 29, 2019, the Indian Army's mountaineering expedition team claimed to have seen Yeti footprints measuring 32 inches long and 15 inches wide near the Makalu Base Camp in Nepal on April 9, 2019 [00:03:02 | 00:03:05 | 00:03:07 | 00:03:11 | 00:03:14 | 00:03:17 | 00:03:20 | 00:03:23 | 00:03:25]. The evidence was photographed and handed over to experts for scientific evaluation [00:03:29 | 00:03:33].

## Scientific Explanations and Real Animal Discoveries

[[scientific_analysis_of_alleged_yeti_evidence]] has consistently found that alleged Yeti evidence points to known animals, primarily bears.

*   **Reinhold Messner's Conclusion**: Legendary Italian climber Reinhold Messner initially denied the Yeti's existence [00:17:13 | 00:17:17 | 00:17:21 | 00:17:24 | 00:17:25]. However, an encounter in 1986, where he saw a large, dark creature standing upright and moving faster than a human, changed his belief [00:00:46 | 00:00:48 | 00:17:28 | 00:17:30 | 00:17:34 | 00:17:39 | 00:17:43 | 00:17:46 | 00:17:48 | 00:17:51 | 00:17:55 | 00:17:56 | 00:17:58]. Despite spending 12 years investigating, he concluded that Yetis do not exist as human-like "abominable snowmen" [00:18:01 | 00:18:04 | 00:18:05 | 00:18:08 | 00:18:10 | 00:18:13 | 00:18:17]. He proposed that the Yeti is a Himalayan brown bear [00:18:19].
*   **Daniel C. Taylor's Research**: American author Daniel C. Taylor, who wrote "Yeti: The Ecology of a Mystery," spent years searching for the Yeti, focusing on Nepal's dense Barun Valley [00:18:30 | 00:18:32 | 00:18:37 | 00:18:40 | 00:18:43 | 00:18:48]. He found fresh footprints that initially convinced him he had found a Yeti, but they turned out to belong to a "tree bear" (Rukh Bhaalu in Nepali) [00:19:01 | 00:19:04 | 00:19:05 | 00:19:08 | 00:19:09 | 00:19:11 | 00:19:31 | 00:19:34 | 00:19:37].
    *   **Footprint Analysis**: Taylor found that the footprints had nail marks, which hominoids do not [00:19:13 | 00:19:15 | 00:19:17]. He explained that bears often place their hind legs on the footprints of their front legs while walking, making it appear as if a bipedal animal made the prints [00:19:42 | 00:19:44 | 00:19:48 | 00:19:50 | 00:19:52]. The front paws leave nail marks, but these are often erased when the hind paws step on them [00:19:54 | 00:19:57 | 00:19:58 | 00:20:02 | 00:20:04 | 00:20:06]. Incomplete overlaps of front and hind feet can also make the combined prints appear larger, around 12 inches long [00:20:08 | 00:20:11 | 00:20:13 | 00:20:17]. He noted that Eric Shipton's famous 1951 photo of Yeti footprints actually shows nail marks in the center, consistent with a bear's combined prints [00:19:38 | 00:19:42 | 00:20:20 | 00:20:23 | 00:20:26 | 00:20:27 | 00:20:30 | 00:20:32]. Bear cubs can also squeeze their paws, creating a thumb-like mark that resembles a human footprint [00:20:39 | 00:20:42 | 00:20:45 | 00:20:47]. Taylor stated that a second photo taken by Shipton clearly showed bear footprints, but only the first photo went viral [00:20:51 | 00:20:52 | 00:20:54 | 00:20:56 | 00:20:58 | 00:21:00 | 00:21:02 | 00:21:03 | 00:21:06].
*   **Ernst Schafer's Discovery**: Zoologist Ernst Schafer, on a secret Nazi Party mission to Tibet in 1939, concluded that the Yeti does not exist [00:21:07 | 00:21:12 | 00:21:16 | 00:21:18]. He identified the beast local people assumed to be a Yeti as a Tibetan bear after shooting one [00:21:19 | 00:21:22 | 00:21:25 | 00:21:28 | 00:21:31]. He communicated this to Reinhold Messner in a letter before his death in 1992 [00:21:31 | 00:21:34 | 00:21:37].
*   **Edmund Hillary's View**: Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to climb Mount Everest, also concluded after months of searching that the Yeti does not exist [00:21:37 | 00:21:40 | 00:21:42 | 00:21:44]. He believed it was a myth born from superstitions [00:21:47 | 00:21:49].

### Modern Scientific Studies and Debunking

[[scientific_analysis_of_alleged_yeti_evidence]] continues to reveal known species as the source of alleged Yeti samples.

*   **Oxford University Study (2014)**: Geneticist Bryan Sykes tested DNA from over 30 hair samples from the Himalayas, all claimed to be from Yeti [00:21:53 | 00:21:54 | 00:21:58 | 00:22:00 | 00:22:05]. While most were from known animals like horses or bears, two samples did not completely match any known species, suggesting a potentially undiscovered animal [00:22:08 | 00:22:09 | 00:22:13 | 00:22:17 | 00:22:20]. However, re-analysis by other scientists revealed Sykes had made an error, and these two samples were also from a known species: a rare subspecies of the Himalayan brown bear [00:22:21 | 00:22:25 | 00:22:28 | 00:22:31 | 00:22:35].
*   **New York University Research (2017)**: A study analyzed over 9 alleged Yeti samples, including hair, bones, and teeth, reaching the same conclusion [00:22:35 | 00:22:38 | 00:22:40 | 00:22:44 | 00:22:48]. Eight samples were from Asian black bears, Himalayan brown bears, or Tibetan brown bears, and one was from a dog [00:22:48 | 00:22:51 | 00:22:53 | 00:22:55].
*   **Arunachal Pradesh Incident (2008) Debunked**: A mysterious death in Arunachal Pradesh, initially rumored to be a Yeti attack, was investigated by BBC Radio journalists Andrew Benfield and Richard Horsey [00:00:54 | 00:01:01 | 00:02:59 | 00:03:02 | 00:22:59 | 00:23:02 | 00:23:04 | 00:23:06 | 00:23:08]. The police FIR stated the cause of death was unknown and made no mention of a Yeti or its footprints [00:23:12 | 00:23:15 | 00:23:18 | 00:23:29 | 00:23:33]. The alleged "Yeti hair" found on the corpse was tested by a doctor and confirmed not to be hair from any biological species, but rather a part of a plant or leaf [00:02:34 | 00:02:38 | 00:23:34 | 00:23:38 | 00:23:41 | 00:23:42 | 00:23:45 | 00:23:47 | 00:23:51 | 00:23:54 | 00:23:55 | 00:23:57 | 00:23:58]. The belief that a Yeti killed the worker was a spreading rumor [00:23:59 | 00:24:03 | 00:24:04].

Today, there is no mystery surrounding Yeti sightings [00:24:07 | 00:24:10]. In the age of smartphones, a real Yeti would have undoubtedly been photographed [00:24:12 | 00:24:13 | 00:24:16 | 00:24:17 | 00:24:19 | 00:24:21 | 00:24:24 | 00:24:26 | 00:24:29].

### [[myth_versus_reality_in_yeti_legends | Myth versus reality in Yeti legends]]

Belief in supernatural and mythological beings like the Yeti is often shaped by society and culture, with stories passed down from childhood creating difficulty in refuting them later in life [00:24:33 | 00:24:35 | 00:24:37 | 00:24:39 | 00:24:42 | 00:24:45 | 00:24:48]. The Yeti represents an idea of escaping modern society, living freely with nature, and offers fascination in a "boring, corporate, consumerist world" [00:24:51 | 00:24:56 | 00:24:59 | 00:25:00 | 00:25:01 | 00:25:04].

## Focusing on Real Animal Discoveries

Instead of focusing on mythical creatures, we should appreciate the actual "treasures" of the natural world [00:25:10 | 00:25:11 | 00:25:15 | 00:25:18 | 00:28:03 | 00:28:06 | 00:28:08 | 00:28:10 | 00:28:13].

*   **Snow Leopards**: The Himalayan mountains, where Yeti is sought, are home to snow leopards, with only about 4,000 remaining and facing endangerment due to climate change [00:25:21 | 00:25:24 | 00:25:26 | 00:25:28 | 00:25:31].
*   **Undiscovered Species**: Experts estimate that only 10-20% of Earth's existing species have been documented [00:25:33 | 00:25:35 | 00:25:38 | 00:25:42]. Each year, numerous new plant and animal species are discovered [00:25:42 | 00:25:46].
    *   **Popa Langur (2020)**: A new monkey species discovered in Myanmar's dense forests [00:25:46 | 00:25:48 | 00:25:51]. It has existed for 1 million years but was only found four years ago [00:25:55 | 00:25:58 | 00:26:00]. Its total population is fewer than 200, and it was declared critically endangered upon discovery [00:26:00 | 00:26:03 | 00:26:06].
    *   **Legless Skinks (2023)**: A new species of legless lizards, resembling snakes but with eyelids, was discovered on Angola's second-highest peak [00:26:06 | 00:26:08 | 00:26:10 | 00:26:14 | 00:26:16 | 00:26:19 | 00:26:20 | 00:26:21].
    *   **Glowing Mystery Mollusk (2024)**: Discovered in the ocean's midnight zone (3,300 to 13,000 feet below surface), this transparent creature can become invisible in water, has visible organs, and can glow [00:26:21 | 00:26:24 | 00:26:28 | 00:26:31 | 00:26:34 | 00:26:36 | 00:26:38 | 00:26:40 | 00:26:41 | 00:26:46].
*   **[[birds_as_modern_descendants_of_dinosaurs | Gigantopithecus]]**: The animal closest in description to the Yeti is the extinct ape, Gigantopithecus [00:26:59 | 00:27:02 | 00:27:05]. This 10-foot-tall ape, weighing 200-300 kg and covered in thick fur, lived from 2 million to 200,000 years ago [00:27:05 | 00:27:06 | 00:27:08 | 00:27:11 | 00:27:12 | 00:27:17 | 00:27:20 | 00:27:22]. It may have walked on two legs [00:27:22]. Its fossils have been found near the Himalayan mountains, suggesting that ancient humans might have seen and interacted with this animal, passing down stories that later evolved into the Tibetan Yeti folktale [00:27:26 | 00:27:30 | 00:27:33 | 00:27:35 | 00:27:37 | 00:27:39 | 00:27:47 | 00:27:49 | 00:27:53].

Instead of chasing myths, the focus should be on protecting and worrying about the existing species around us, ensuring they are not lost [00:28:15 | 00:28:17 | 00:28:19 | 00:28:21].

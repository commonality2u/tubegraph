The lives of celebrities, as often portrayed on [[role_of_social_media_in_spreading_information | social media]], can be highly inauthentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Paid social media trends, sponsored posts, paid paparazzi, and paid podcasts are frequently utilized to generate hype for films and celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Even reported box office collections often contain inaccuracies and fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Evolution of Paparazzi and Paid Publicity

The term "paparazzi" refers to individuals whose job is to photograph celebrities and high-profile figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The word originated from a 1960 Italian film, *La Dolce Vita*, where a character named Paparazzo was an annoying but fearless reporter, ready to go to any lengths for celebrity photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The director of the film chose the name because "paparazzo" is an Italian slang term for a large, annoying mosquito, reflecting the reporter's intrusive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

In the 1990s, India saw the rise of its paparazzi culture, influenced by the economic liberalization of 1991 and the arrival of tabloid media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Back then, the business model involved taking candid photos of celebrities and selling them to magazines and tabloids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This gained popularity due to public curiosity about celebrities' private lives in the absence of [[role_of_social_media_in_spreading_information | social media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

However, with the advent of [[role_of_social_media_in_spreading_information | social media]], the system has transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Now, many paparazzi openly admit to receiving direct payments from celebrities to click their "candid" photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Smaller or new stars often pay paparazzi for PR and publicity, while top A-list celebrities like Shahrukh Khan or Virat Kohli, who don't need publicity, are still secretly photographed by paparazzi for public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## The Extent of Inauthenticity

The question of how authentic celebrity photos and appearances are is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. While some industry insiders suggest a 30:70 ratio of authentic to paid photos, it is argued that up to 90% of what is seen about celebrities on [[role_of_social_media_in_spreading_information | social media]], TV, and newspapers are paid promotions and fake acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This highlights a significant challenge in [[authenticity_of_celebrity_social_media_posts | authenticity of celebrity social media posts]].

*   **Paid Podcasts and Interviews**: A majority of celebrities appear on podcasts primarily when their movies are about to be released, indicating a promotional purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Social Media PR**: Many posts on celebrity-focused [[role_of_social_media_in_spreading_information | social media]] accounts are paid promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. An example is an "Instant Bollywood" Instagram post that mistakenly included instructions for the celebrity's desired caption, revealing it as a paid promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Fake Social Media Trends and Reviews

On platforms like Twitter, it is common to see hashtags for new movie releases trending, filled with tweets praising the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. These tweets often use identical language and phrases because they are fake, orchestrated by PR companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This illustrates a prevalent "business of fake reviews" on [[role_of_social_media_in_spreading_information | social media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

One example shows an account named 'Sapna' promoting various entities from the same timeline, including "The Times of India," "ABP News," different political parties (BJP, Congress, Kejriwal), and movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. These accounts are clearly paid for promotions and often handled by PR companies, indicating a form of [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | propaganda techniques]] and contributing to [[fake_news_in_indian_media | fake news in Indian media]] and [[criticism_of_indian_media_and_fake_news | criticism of Indian media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Corporate Bookings and Inflated Box Office Numbers

A newer trend involves "corporate bookings," where film producers book a significant number of tickets themselves to distribute to companies or corporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This is done under the guise of "Promotional Activities," "Employee Engagement," or "Client Entertainment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The true purpose is to create artificial hype by making shows appear houseful, thereby motivating others to watch the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

In 2023, one family-entertainer Bollywood film spent ₹200 million on corporate bookings, and two other films later that year spent around ₹700 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Despite shows being marked "houseful" online, the halls were often empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This practice, along with "self-booking" (individuals inflating numbers with their own money), casts doubt on the authenticity of reported box office collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## The Credibility Crisis in Awards

The inauthenticity extends to awards in the entertainment industry. Shah Rukh Khan once confessed to trying to bribe an editor for a Best Actor award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Similarly, Alia Bhatt openly admitted she would not have attended an award show unless she was guaranteed an award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

This has led to a significant decline in the credibility of award shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Award shows now frequently create new, often arbitrary, categories to ensure everyone receives an award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Examples include "Hot&Techy 'Performer of the Year' Award" and "Nothing to Hide Award" in film awards, and categories like "Trendsetter of the Year" or "Emerging Fashion Influencer Award" in influencer awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Invitations to these awards often come with conditions, such as direct payment or indirect promotion, highlighting significant [[challenges_with_influencer_ethics_and_promotion_standards | challenges with influencer ethics and promotion standards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This is why some prominent figures like Aamir Khan have avoided award functions for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

## Celebrity Privacy vs. Managed Publicity

Most Bollywood celebrities could easily maintain their privacy if they wished to, which is why some are rarely seen in paparazzi photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Conversely, others, like Kim Kardashian, meticulously manage their paparazzi photos, sometimes even editing them before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Kylie Jenner even staged a fake "candid" photoshoot after unflattering real photos went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

Despite the prevalence of managed publicity, genuine privacy violations do occur. Incidents like paparazzi intruding on Alia Bhatt's home or a video of Virat Kohli's hotel room being publicly shared highlight the extreme disregard for celebrity privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Celebrities use various methods to protect their privacy, such as strict no-photo policies at events (e.g., Katrina Kaif and Vicky Kaushal's wedding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, using anti-paparazzi scarves that block cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, or even decoy cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## Impact on the Common Public

The pervasive nature of this fake celebrity world significantly impacts ordinary people:
*   **Unrealistic Expectations**: Individuals often form unrealistic expectations about appearance, success, and happiness based on the curated lives of celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This can lead to extreme measures, such as undergoing extensive cosmetic surgeries to emulate perceived ideal celebrity looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Dangerous Fan Worship**: The artificial hype can foster dangerous levels of fan worship, as seen when a fan of actor Yash self-immolated after being unable to meet him on his birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This underscores the need for [[social_responsibility_among_influencers | social responsibility among influencers]].

## Threat to the Industry

The continuous promotion of inauthentic images, bad films, and unworthy actors through fake hype risks eroding public interest in the film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. While people might be fooled once or twice, repeated exposure to misleading content will eventually lead to disillusionment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Viewers are advised to enjoy films for entertainment but avoid getting consumed by the manufactured reality of celebrity lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

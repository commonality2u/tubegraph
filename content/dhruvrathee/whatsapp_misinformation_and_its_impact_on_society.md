During the 2024 elections, politicians have used historical figures like Aurangzeb and the Mughals in their campaigning. Prime Minister Modi, for instance, stated that Congress does not remember Aurangzeb's atrocities, claiming he destroyed hundreds of Hindu temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Such statements are not accidental but intentional talking points originating from what is described as "WhatsApp's brainwashing mafia's Department #2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## [[the_influence_of_whatsapp_in_political_brainwashing | The Influence of WhatsApp in Political Brainwashing]]

The intent behind these talking points, which are circulated via [[whatsapp_and_media_brainwashing_tactics | WhatsApp brainwashing tactics]], is to create a narrative that makes people feel their Hindu ancestors were enslaved by Muslims for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This strategy aims to portray Hindus as victims who have been oppressed, fostering a sense of grievance against Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The goal is to project that "Hindus are in danger because of Muslims," thereby encouraging votes for figures like PM Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

### Distortion of Historical Narratives

This [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | misinformation]] campaign targets historians like Romila Thapar and Irfan Habib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, who are vilified for challenging the narrative of Hindus as perpetual slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The "brainwashing mafia" insists that "Hindus were enslaved by Muslims for thousands of years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. However, historical facts often contradict these [[claims_of_spreading_hatred_and_misinformation | claims of spreading hatred and misinformation]].

For example, the notion that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was oppressed by Muslims is false, as he was a great emperor who strengthened his empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The "WhatsApp University" promotes a "Double Think" concept, where contradictory ideas, such as Hindus being oppressed while Shivaji's empire was free, are simultaneously accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

Historical evidence shows:
*   **Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj:** His family, including his grandfather, respected both Hindu and Muslim saints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. He favored religious freedom, protecting places of worship for all religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. His soldiers were forbidden from harming women, the Qur'an, or mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Shivaji's army included many Muslims, even Muslim generals and chiefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. When Shivaji defeated Afzal Khan, Afzal Khan's advisor was a Hindu Brahmin, while Shivaji carried an iron claw on the advice of his Muslim bodyguard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Aurangzeb:** While often portrayed as a fanatic oppressor of Hindus, historical records show a more complex picture. His army included Hindus, with Mirza Raja Jai Singh, a Hindu Rajput, leading his army in the Battle of Purandar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. His chief diwan was a Hindu, Raja Raghunath Ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, and Hindu participation in the Mughal administration increased by 50% under his rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. He also issued orders to protect Brahmins and Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> and granted lands for the construction of Hindu and Jain temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. However, it is also true that during his rule, many Hindu temples were demolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, customs duty for Hindu traders was doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, and Jizya tax was imposed on non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Akbar:** He practiced "Sulh-i-Kul" (Peace For All) and treated all religions equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. His "Nine Gems" (Navratna) included four Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Ramcharitmanas was written during his rule, and Ram Leela began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Many Hindu epics were translated into Persian under his reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   **Dara Shikoh:** This Mughal prince translated 52 Upanishads and the Bhagawat Geeta into Persian, believing the Upanishads to be humanity's first monotheistic text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. His translations helped these texts reach Western philosophers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   **Bahadur Shah Zafar:** The last Mughal ruler, he celebrated Eid, Dussehra, and Diwali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. He opposed British colonialism and united leaders against British rule in 1857 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## Modern Parallels and [[the_role_of_misinformation_in_political_support_for_pm_modi | The Role of Misinformation in Political Support for PM Modi]]

Eminent historian Harbans Mukhia has called Narendra Modi a "modern parallel of Aurangzeb" due to similarities like being born in Gujarat, projecting themselves as holy figures, and being power-hungry, adopting both communal and secular stances depending on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

> [!INFO] Dual Nature
> PM Modi has at times praised Islam for its message of peace and harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, spoken of holding the Qur'an in one hand and a computer in the other for Muslim youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, and advised BJP workers against anti-Muslim remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

> Conversely, he has made remarks to identify people "spreading discord by their clothes" during CAA-NRC protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Under his leadership, BJP politicians have made hateful speeches, and convicts in cases like Bilkis Bano were welcomed with flowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. His recent speeches have contained "dog-whistling" against Muslims, accusing the opposition of a "Mughal mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. He also follows Twitter accounts that spread hatred against Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This demonstrates a clear [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | media bias and misinformation in Indian politics]].

## The [[role_of_media_in_spreading_mass_hysteria | Role of Media in Spreading Mass Hysteria]]

The "WhatsApp mafia" and pro-government [[role_of_social_media_in_spreading_information | social media]] circulate propaganda to fill hearts with hatred and create a divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. They promote the idea that Hindus have been downtrodden for thousands of years and only gained "real confidence" after 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This disregards the confidence and contributions of historical figures like Emperor Krishnadevaraya, Maharana Pratap, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and saints like Tulsidas and Swami Vivekananda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Combating Misinformation

This is part of the broader [[strategies_to_combat_misinformation_and_protect_democracy | strategies to combat misinformation and protect democracy]].

Despite the deliberate attempts to create division, evidence shows that common Hindus and Muslims have coexisted happily throughout history, a tradition known as Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb, marked by mutual respect, shared festivals, and flourishing art forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This includes modern examples like Muslims organizing Ram Leela, dressing as Hindu deities, and Hindus organizing Iftar parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

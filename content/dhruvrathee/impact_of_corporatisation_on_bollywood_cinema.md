Bollywood has been described as having "lost its soul" and "slowly killing itself" due to internal issues, despite record-breaking box office numbers in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. While films like Shahrukh Khan's *Jawan*, *Pathaan*, and *Dunki* contributed to a significant increase in Bollywood's share of the Indian box office from 19% in 2021 to 44% in 2023, and others like *Tiger 3*, *Rocky Rani Ki Prem Kahani*, and *Oh My God 2* also performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, this success hides a "bitter truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Context: COVID-19 and OTT Competition

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted Bollywood, as lockdowns prevented people from visiting cinemas and encouraged home viewing on screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This period saw unprecedented growth in OTT platforms, which offered numerous films at a fraction of the cost, with some even becoming free through ad-revenue models like Amazon MX Player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. These platforms provide a vast library of content, including classics, regional language films (Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Punjabi), and international cinema dubbed in Hindi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This rise of OTT platforms created intense [[competition_from_ott_platforms_and_international_films | competition from both international and regional films]], exacerbating Bollywood's internal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Corporatisation

A major problem "hollowing out" Bollywood from within is the increasing corporatisation of the film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Many film producers, driven by the desire for minimal effort and maximum profit, have adopted a formula for creating "hit" films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### The "Hit Formula"

This corporate formula dictates specific approaches to filmmaking:
*   **Avoid Experimentation** Don't try anything new; stick to what has proven successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   **Action-Oriented and Derivative Content** Focus on action films with violence, sequels, and remakes, including old songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   **Superstar Casting** Cast superstars in lead roles and only actors with good "face value" in side roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
*   **Hollywood Imitation** Copy Hollywood films for stories, scenes, and scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Audience Appeasement** Avoid questioning negative mindsets or making thought-provoking films; instead, appease popular opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **Fast Pacing** Cater to decreased attention spans by making everything fast-paced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **"Larger Than Life" Spectacle** Emphasize big stars, sets, locations, budgets, and extensive VFX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Heavy Marketing** Spend a significant amount on marketing to ensure widespread discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### Consequences of the Formula

This formula results in "Blockbusters" that break records but are not memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Films that "touch your heart, force you to think, and the ones you want to watch again and again" are disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Many of the highest-grossing films, like *Jawan*, *Pathaan*, *Dilwale*, and *Happy New Year*, are considered mediocre compared to earlier works by the same superstars, such as *Dilwale Dulhaniyan Le Jayenge* or *Swades* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Similarly, Salman Khan's recent films like *Tiger 3* and *Kick* are seen as inferior to his classics like *Maine Pyar Kiya* or *Hum Aapke Hain Kaun* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

In contrast, historically highest-grossing films (adjusted for inflation) like *Mughal-e-Azam*, *Sholay*, and *Mother India* possessed proper stories, emotions, and substance, proving that quality cinema can also be blockbusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

### Filmmakers' Critique of Corporatisation

Filmmaker Shekhar Kapur predicted 25 years ago that corporations would control creativity if directors didn't unite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Anurag Basu stated that studios, not directors, often decide what films are made, frequently rejecting original ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. Shyam Benegal described studio-backed films as a "factory line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. Screenwriter Chirag Garg noted that writing has become mechanical, unlike the passionate approach of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

Hollywood faces similar issues, with accusations that VFX is prioritized over storytelling, but its larger budgets and advanced technology make it difficult for Bollywood to compete on those terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

## [[financial_inequality_and_inflated_actor_fees_in_bollywood | Financial Inequality and Inflated Actor Fees]]

Despite the perception of wealth, Bollywood suffers from a lack of money due to severe inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. In 2023, while the Indian box office earned ₹122.26 billion from approximately 1,000 films, 40% of this was earned by only the top 1% of films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Small and medium-budget films, especially those without well-known actors, struggle to be profitable, with only about 5 such films achieving significant profit in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

Many formula-chasing, mass-appealing films, such as *Adipurush*, *Ganapath*, *Shehzada*, *Selfie*, *Tejas*, *Vedaa*, *Sarfira*, and *Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan*, have flopped despite large budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. *Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan*, for instance, cost ₹3.5 billion but earned only ₹1.02 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[0:11:08]</a>.

A significant contributing factor is the inflated fees of Bollywood superstars. Half of a film's budget can be spent on just one star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. For example, Akshay Kumar received ₹600 million for *Khel Khel Mein*, which had a total budget of ₹1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Prabhas received ₹1.5 billion for *Adipurush*, while Kriti Sanon got only ₹30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. This leaves minimal funds for story development, direction, screenplay, dialogues, CGI, and VFX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

This phenomenon is driven by the studios' greed, as they pay immense sums in the hope of earning billions, prioritizing short-term gains over sustainable long-term business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. Trade analyst Komal Nahta observed that "no one actually cares about Bollywood" as actors prioritize their bank balance and producers focus only on viewership, not the industry as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.

## [[loss_of_originality_and_creativity_in_bollywood | Loss of Originality and Creativity]]

Bollywood films are increasingly criticized for lacking imagination, with the "age-old Bollywood drama" having "dried up" and no longer containing a distinct "Indian element" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. The once "reliable ninja technique" of remaking Tamil and Telugu films is now ineffective because audiences can easily watch the originals on OTT platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

The industry has moved away from diverse genres, primarily producing only three types of films: melodramatic action, melodramatic comedy, or melodramatic patriotic films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. The variety and diversity in movies are declining annually, and films for children are no longer being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the period 10-15 years ago when Bollywood experimented with various genres, including horror, animation, superhero films, and alien themes, which "breathed a soul into Bollywood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>.

Javed Akhtar noted that the "angry young man" character of the 1980s, exemplified by Amitabh Bachchan, drew its anger from deep pain, which audiences could feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. However, contemporary characters lack such depth, becoming "great actors" rather than "great characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. The rapid corporatisation has replaced senior creative minds like Javed Akhtar in script shortlisting with 24 or 25-year-old corporate MBAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>, despite no shortage of talented actors, writers, and filmmakers in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

## Marginalization of Independent and Small-Budget Films

Independent and small-budget films face increasing difficulty securing theatrical releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. They rarely get prime time slots and are often removed from cinemas after just a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. This prevents them from gaining word-of-mouth publicity, a crucial factor for success in the past, as seen with *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge*, which had a slow start but became a classic due to extended theatrical runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.

Filmmaker Dibakar Banerjee stated that independent cinema is being "systematically sidelined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>. He noted that the promotion of the "₹100 Crore Club" tells audiences to watch films that make money and ignore those that don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. Films like *All That Breathes* and a film about Khudiram Bose, which won national or international awards, often don't get theatrical releases in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.

Additionally, inflated movie ticket prices make cinema inaccessible to many, turning a once-weekly middle-class activity into a rare "picnic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. This system, with its focus on "big budgets, big actors, big sets, big films, expensive tickets, and expensive popcorn," eliminates the possibility of small films like *Bheja Fry* (made for ₹5.4 million, earning ₹125 million) or *Kahaani* (made for ₹80 million, earning ₹1.04 billion) achieving significant success through word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>.

While many acclaimed independent films are now labeled "OTT films," many OTT platforms now require a successful box office run before acquiring a film, creating a Catch-22 for small productions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>.

## Towards a Sustainable Future

The rising monopoly driven by the greed of film studios is causing the Bollywood industry to sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>. Siddharth Roy Kapur, founder of Roy Kapur Films, emphasized that small-budget films "oil the wheels of the industry" and that an industry reliant solely on a few blockbusters is not sustainable in the long term, potentially leading to a lack of workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>.

The solution, though difficult, requires Bollywood's entire ecosystem to become more inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>. This means supporting low-budget films from production to release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>. Lower budgets would allow for more films, create more jobs, and lead to cheaper tickets, thus attracting a larger audience including the poor and encouraging more frequent attendance from the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. Production houses of superstars could also contribute by producing content-driven, small-budget films, as Aamir Khan's production house did with *Laapataa Ladies* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. This shift back to "content-driven, unique, meaningful films with good music, songs, and acting" is presented as the only way to save the Hindi film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.

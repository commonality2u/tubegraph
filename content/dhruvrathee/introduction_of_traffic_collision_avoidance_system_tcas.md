The Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is a crucial safety system mandated for aircraft following a major air disaster in India. Its implementation aimed to prevent future mid-air collisions.

## Context: The [[Charkhi_Dadri_midair_collision | Charkhi Dadri Mid-Air Collision]]

On November 12, 1996, at approximately 03:55 PM, a catastrophic mid-air collision occurred near the city of [[Charkhi_Dadri_midair_collision | Charkhi Dadri]], about 100 km from Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This incident involved a chartered Kazakhstan Airlines aircraft flying towards New Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> and a Saudi Airlines flight departing from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It was the first and only mid-air collision in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> and the worst air disaster in India's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

At the time of the collision, Air Traffic Controller (ATC) VK Dutta was on duty, guiding both planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He instructed the Saudi plane to climb to 14,000 ft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> and the Kazakh plane to remain at 15,000 ft, specifically telling it not to descend further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The standard safety regulation requires a minimum vertical distance of 1,000 ft between two aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The collision occurred at 14,000 ft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, meaning the Kazakh aeroplane had descended from its assigned altitude of 15,000 ft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Investigations revealed that the Kazakh pilots either misunderstood the ATC's instructions or thought they were for another flight, partly due to language barriers and communication issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Furthermore, [[Air_Traffic_Control_and_radar_technology | radar technology]] in use during the 1990s was primary radar, which could only provide approximate horizontal distances, requiring ATCs to rely on pilot communication for exact altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Mandating TCAS

Following the [[Charkhi_Dadri_midair_collision | Charkhi Dadri accident]], the Indian government and aviation experts globally learned valuable lessons and implemented significant changes to the [[aviation_safety_procedures_and_regulations | aviation safety procedures and regulations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. One major step was the mandatory installation of the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Five months after the accident, Civil Aviation Minister CM Ibrahim announced in the Lok Sabha that, effective December 31, 1998, all 30+ seater aircraft in India would be compulsorily fitted with TCAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## How TCAS Works

TCAS is designed to prevent mid-air collisions by:
*   **Alarming pilots** if another aircraft gets closer than 1,000 ft of vertical distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Informing the pilot** of the specific direction to fly (e.g., climb or descend) to maintain the required 1,000 ft separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Global Impact and [[Aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | Safety Improvements]]

The decision by India to mandate TCAS was a significant step, as the technology was very expensive at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Many countries initially resisted due to the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, but India maintained its stance, which eventually led other countries to implement the system in their aircraft as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

The introduction of TCAS, along with other [[aviation_safety_improvements_post1996 | post-1996 aviation safety improvements]] like separated air corridors for incoming and departing planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> and the requirement for pilots to have a minimum level of English proficiency for international flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, significantly enhanced [[aviation_safety_procedures_and_regulations | aviation safety]]. These measures reflect the application of the Swiss Cheese Model of accident causation, where multiple layers of defense are strengthened to prevent failures from aligning and leading to disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

Thanks to these advancements, particularly the widespread adoption of TCAS, there has not been another mid-air collision in India since the [[Charkhi_Dadri_midair_collision | Charkhi Dadri accident]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

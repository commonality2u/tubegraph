The 2014 film *Interstellar*, directed by Christopher Nolan, depicted space-related concepts such as wormholes, black holes, and alien planets in a scientifically accurate way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A notable scene features the main character, Cooper, falling into a black hole named Gargantua <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. His experience depicted darkness, followed by grain-like particles, flashes of light, and his spacecraft catching fire, before he ejected and found himself in a five-dimensional tesseract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This article explores the scientific understanding and theoretical aspects of black holes, examining what we know and what remains speculative.

A black hole is defined as a region in space where the force of gravity is so strong that not even light can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## [[history_and_discovery_of_black_holes | History and Discovery of Black Holes]]

Black holes remained largely unknown until the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Their theoretical discovery stemmed from [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein's Theory of Relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Einstein's Theory of Relativity and Time Dilation

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein's Theory of Relativity]] has two parts:
*   **Special Theory of Relativity (1905)**: Explains how speed influences time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. If an object moves very fast, time slows down for it relative to observers not moving at that speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This phenomenon is called Kinematic Time Dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **General Theory of Relativity (1915)**: Demonstrated that gravity also causes time dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The stronger the gravitational force, the more time slows down, a concept known as Gravitational Time Dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This was depicted in *Interstellar* when one hour on an aqua planet near the Gargantua black hole equalled seven years on Earth, due to the black hole's gravitational impact on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

To visualize gravity's effect, Einstein proposed imagining a space-time fabric or mesh, on which all planetary objects are placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The mass of objects bends this fabric, which not only attracts physical objects but also causes time dilation and affects other forms of energy like sound, heat, and light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This implies the existence of objects with such high gravitational force that they can completely absorb light, appearing completely black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. These are black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Theoretical Proof and Naming

Initially, the concept of black holes was purely theoretical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Einstein himself found the idea of actual black holes "weird" and did not believe they existed in reality during his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The term "black hole" was not even invented when he passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

After Einstein, many scientists like Karl Schwarzschild and Roger Penrose worked on the General Theory of Relativity, solving equations that theoretically proved the existence of black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. By the 1960s, researchers agreed that black holes likely existed in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The term "Black Hole" was first used by a magazine in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, and popularized by physicist John Wheeler in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Formation of Black Holes

The name "black hole" is misleading, as it suggests an actual hole in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Instead, black holes are formed from stars and contain dense material at their center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Stellar Life Cycles and Collapse

Stars, including our Sun, maintain equilibrium through a continuous nuclear fusion reaction at their center, which produces heat and light pushing outwards, balanced by the inward force of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This balance lasts as long as the star has fuel (Hydrogen or Helium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. When the fuel runs out, the outward pressure ceases, and the star collapses under its own gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

The outcome of this collapse depends on the star's mass:
*   **Small or Average-Sized Stars**: Turn into a Red Giant, then potentially a planetary nebula or a White Dwarf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Huge Stars (High Mass)**: After running out of fuel, they cool down into a Red Super Giant, then burst into a Supernova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The remaining core can become a Neutron Star if tiny, or a Black Hole if bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

A star's mass collapsing into a small, condensed volume can form a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. For example, if a star the size of our Sun were to become a black hole, its diameter would be a mere 50 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Chandrasekhar Limit

Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar developed the Chandrasekhar Limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This limit states that the maximum stable mass for a White Dwarf is 1.4 times the mass of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Beyond this, it becomes unstable and turns into a Neutron Star or a Black Hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Our Sun is below this limit, so it will not become a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## [[types_of_black_holes_and_their_characteristics | Types of Black Holes and Their Characteristics]]

There are mainly three to four types of black holes:
*   **Stellar Black Hole**: The most common type, created from collapsed stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Scientists estimate 10 million to 1 billion of these exist in our Milky Way Galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Primordial Black Holes**: Hypothetical black holes as small as an atom but with the mass of a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Supermassive Black Hole**: Enormous black holes with a mass exceeding 1 million Suns, capable of fitting into a sphere the size of our Solar System <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Scientists believe a Supermassive Black Hole resides at the center of every major galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Our Milky Way's central Supermassive Black Hole is called Sagittarius A* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The black hole Gargantua in *Interstellar* was depicted as a supermassive black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Intermediate Black Hole**: A theoretical fourth type, lying in size between Stellar and Supermassive black holes, though no proof has been discovered yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Anatomy of a Black Hole

Contrary to popular belief, a black hole is not a large black ball that simply sucks everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### Accretion Disk

A key feature of black holes is the Accretion Disk, an orange-colored ring formed around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Due to the black hole's immense gravitational pull, gaseous matter and debris are attracted and revolve around it at very high speeds, similar to planets orbiting the Sun but far more intense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. These materials heat up to over a million degrees Celsius, becoming a flowing, fire-like fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. As they spin faster and closer to the black hole, they rub together, compress, and glow, emitting electromagnetic radiation, primarily X-rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

While *Interstellar* accurately depicted the accretion disk, it was incorrectly shown as orange; human eyes cannot see X-rays, and the true color would be closer to blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The first photo of a black hole, taken in 2019 by the Event Horizon telescope, also used yellowish-orange for representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This image also showed that particles on one side of the disk appear brighter due to the Doppler Beaming effect, indicating they are spinning towards us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

The accretion disk can also create an optical illusion due to gravitational lensing, making it seem to cover the top and bottom of the black hole because gravity bends light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Photonsphere

Inside the accretion disk lies the Photonsphere, a last circle of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. In this region, gravity is so strong that photons (light particles) begin to orbit the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Theoretically, if one could survive reaching this area, it might be possible to see the back of one's own head due to the circular path of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Event Horizon

Beyond the Photonsphere is the Event Horizon, considered the boundary of the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. After crossing this point, gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Everything beyond it appears completely black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. If one crosses the Event Horizon, escape is theoretically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## Inside a Black Hole: Singularity and Speculation

The climax of *Interstellar*, where Cooper falls into Gargantua and reaches a five-dimensional space, is purely imaginative speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. We do not know what lies inside the Event Horizon, and for these parts, the movie resorted to imagination as science has not yet discovered them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Singularity

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_its_relation_to_black_holes | Einstein's General Theory of Relativity]] describes the center of a black hole as a Singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This is a region where the curvature of space-time becomes infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The space-time fabric is bent so immensely that it stretches infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. As gravity increases, time slows down infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. What this means for time is unknown, and only theories can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. One theory suggests that inside the Event Horizon, light might reflect at multiple points before reaching Singularity, making things visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## Misconceptions and Safety

The first practical proof of a black hole's existence came from a single photo taken by the Event Horizon telescope on April 10, 2019, about 100 years after they were theoretically proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

If one were to fall into a black hole, the chances are that they would disintegrate into pieces due to the gravitational force, dying in milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. However, there is no need to fear black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. A common misconception is that black holes suck up all matter, continuously grow, and will eventually destroy the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

As noted earlier, a supermassive black hole is at the center of every galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. All planetary bodies and stars within its range revolve around it, similar to how planets in our Solar System revolve around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Thus, by maintaining a proper distance, one remains safe and secure from black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

The lives of celebrities are often portrayed as fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, with much of what is shown on social media being untrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Various tactics are employed to create hype for films and celebrities, including paid social media trends, paid posts, paid paparazzi, and paid podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Even box office collections reported to the public often contain lies and frauds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Paparazzi Phenomenon

Bollywood actors and celebrities are frequently followed by paparazzi, whether at the airport late at night or leaving the gym in the afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Even mundane activities like traveling by auto-rickshaw can become news headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This contrasts sharply with most YouTubers or even less popular Bollywood actors, who rarely experience such constant media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Ironically, some relatively unknown individuals are repeatedly featured by paparazzi in social media and newspapers to gain fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Origin of the Term 'Paparazzi'
The term "paparazzi" refers to individuals whose job is to photograph celebrities and high-profile figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It is a plural word, with the singular form being 'Paparazzo' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The word originated from the 1960 Italian film *La Dolce Vita*, where a side character named Paparazzo was an annoying yet fearless reporter determined to get celebrity photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The film's director, Federico Fellini, chose the name because 'Paparazzo' is an Italian slang term for a large, annoying mosquito, which he felt accurately depicted the reporter's intrusive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The word became widely popular after a 1961 *Time* magazine feature article described paparazzi as "a pack of hungry wolves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Evolution of Paparazzi Culture
In the past, paparazzi culture was known for secretly taking photos of celebrities without permission, often disregarding their privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. A notable instance of this was the 1997 car accident involving Princess Diana, where paparazzi cars were reportedly chasing her vehicle, contributing to the fatal crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This incident led to global questioning of the ethical boundaries of paparazzi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

In India, paparazzi culture emerged in the 1990s following economic liberalization, bringing with it tabloid publications like Stardust and Midday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Yogen Shah is recognized as India's first paparazzo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Initially, the business model was simple: capture candid photos of popular celebrities and sell them to magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This was popular because, without social media, public access to celebrity lives was limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

However, with the advent of social media, the system has reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Now, many paparazzi openly admit to being paid by celebrities to take 'candid' photos for public relations and publicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. While some top A-list celebrities like Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan, and Virat Kohli still have their photos secretly taken due to public demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, a significant portion of celebrity photos seen in media are paid PR photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Estimates suggest that 90% of what is seen about celebrities on social media, TV, or in newspapers are paid promotions and fake acting, with only 10% being authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This directly impacts the [[Authenticity of celebrity social media posts]].

## Manipulating Public Perception

### Social Media and Paid Content
Most celebrities appear on podcasts and interviews primarily when their movies are about to be released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Many social media pages that regularly post about Bollywood and celebrities feature posts that are often PR and paid promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. An example of this was an 'Instant Bollywood' Instagram post that mistakenly included instructions from the celebrity on what to caption, revealing its paid nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Fake Reviews and Trends
Paid social media trends are common. For instance, when a new movie is released, its hashtag often trends on Twitter, filled with tweets praising the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. These tweets frequently use identical language and phrases because they are fake, orchestrated by PR companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Such PR accounts often promote various brands, movies, and even political parties simultaneously, indicating their paid nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This phenomenon highlights the [[Role of media and misinformation in shaping public opinion]] and the [[Impact of political influence on media]].

### Corporate Bookings and Box Office Fraud
A newer trend is "corporate bookings," where film producers book their own films to distribute tickets to companies or corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This is done to create hype, making it appear as if shows are houseful, which motivates other people to watch the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Millions of rupees are spent on these corporate bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This practice means that reported box office collections often contain lies and frauds, masking the film's true performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### Bought Awards
The manipulation extends to awards. There are regular accusations that awards in almost every industry are bought and sold, leading to a significant loss of credibility for award shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Shah Rukh Khan once confessed to attempting to bribe an editor for a Best Actor award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Alia Bhatt also openly stated that she would not have attended an award show if she hadn't been guaranteed an award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Award shows often create new, random categories to ensure everyone receives an award, further diminishing their prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This trend is also seen in influencer awards, where new categories are continuously created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Many invitations to these awards come with conditions, such as direct payment or indirect promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## Celebrity Privacy vs. Public Image
Despite the efforts to create fake hype, many Bollywood celebrities could easily maintain their privacy if they wished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. However, some, like Kim Kardashian in Hollywood, are known for their heavily curated public images, even reportedly editing paparazzi photos before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. On the other hand, there are genuine instances where celebrities are fed up with paparazzi intrusions, like Jaya Bachchan's clear displeasure with being photographed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Cases like paparazzi photographing Alia Bhatt inside her home or a video of Virat Kohli's hotel room being publicly shared highlight the shameless disregard for privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. To counter this, celebrities use methods like anti-paparazzi scarves that block cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a> and decoy cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## [[Influence of media on social behavior and norms | Impact on Public Perception and Behavior]]
This strange, often fake, world of celebrities significantly impacts common people. Those unaware of these manipulative tactics can easily be fooled by the celebrity lifestyle, leading to unrealistic expectations about appearance, success, and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Some individuals undergo extensive cosmetic surgeries to emulate celebrity looks, viewing them as an ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. The fake hype also contributes to dangerous levels of fan worship, as seen when a fan of actor Yash self-immolated after being unable to meet him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

The pervasive fake glamour threatens the film industry itself. If genuine actors and films are not promoted, public interest will dwindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. While people might be fooled once or twice into watching unworthy films, repeated exposure to bad films, promoted bad actors, and inauthentic social media images will eventually lead to public disillusionment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Ultimately, it is advisable for individuals to enjoy films for entertainment but to avoid getting caught up in the fake world of celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, including reality TV shows, which have a negative [[Impact of reality TV shows on society and mental health | impact on society and mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

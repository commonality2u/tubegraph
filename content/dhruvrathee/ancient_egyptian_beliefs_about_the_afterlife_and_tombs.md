The ancient Egyptians constructed monumental structures, primarily the pyramids, as tombs for their monarchs, known as Pharaohs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. These structures were built around 4,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, with [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | The Great Pyramid of Giza]] estimated to have been built in 2560 BC by Pharaoh Khufu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Belief in the Afterlife

A fundamental reason for building these grand tombs was the ancient Egyptians' belief in the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. They held that life does not end with death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Instead, the soul of a deceased person was believed to travel to the underworld, where it would be judged by the Gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Those who lived a life of goodness were thought to achieve immortality in the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Preparations for the Afterlife

To prepare for this continuation of existence, Pharaohs would commission elaborate tombs for themselves while they were still reigning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. These preparations included:
*   **Provisions for the Afterlife** A large amount of food, treasures, jewelry, furniture, and clothes were buried with the Pharaoh inside the pyramid, intended for use in the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Mummification** After death, the Pharaohs' bodies were mummified and then sealed in a wooden or stone sarcophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

The belief was that the grander a tomb and the more treasures and food it contained, the better the Pharaoh's experience in the afterlife would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Evidence Supporting the Tombs Theory

Historians and archaeologists are largely in agreement that the pyramids, including [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | The Great Pyramid of Giza]], were built as tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The certainty of this purpose stems from two primary reasons:
1.  **Written Scripts and Texts** Scripts found on several other pyramids, as well as texts on sarcophaguses, describe ancient Egyptian customs related to burial and the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
2.  **Historical Use** The majority of historical pyramids discovered in Egypt and Sudan have consistently been used as tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

While [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | The Great Pyramid of Giza]] itself yielded no substantial direct evidence like a preserved body or treasures upon initial archaeological entry (only three relics and an empty sarcophagus, believed to be Khufu's, were found) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, it is believed that any treasures were looted prior to the archaeologists' arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Rejection of Alternative Theories

The lack of immediate direct evidence within [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | The Great Pyramid of Giza]] itself has led some to propose [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | alternative theories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. One such theory claimed the pyramid was a granary for storing crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This idea, proposed by American politician Ben Carson in 1998, suggested that "Joseph built the Pyramids in order to store grains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, this and other [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | bizarre theories]] are often criticized for lacking logical sense and being driven by religious or other non-scientific motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Current historical consensus firmly rejects these [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | alternative theories]] in favor of the pyramid's purpose as a tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | British East India Company]] (EIC) and the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal Empire]] engaged in significant conflicts throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, ultimately leading to the decline of Mughal power and the rise of British dominance in India.

## Initial Encounters and Mughal Supremacy
In 1686, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | British East India Company]] declared war on the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. At this time, [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maraj | Aurangzeb]] was the emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This war was a significant blunder for the EIC, as their army was small and weak compared to the formidable [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal]] forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughals]] easily defeated the EIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, seizing their factories in India and arresting many officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The EIC's Governor had to humble himself before [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maraj | Aurangzeb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] was founded in 1600 by merchants as a Joint Stock Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. Its initial goal was to trade in spices from Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. Facing stiff competition from Dutch traders in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>, the EIC decided to shift its focus to India, where spices and textiles were abundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>.

In 1608, EIC merchants landed in Surat, Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>. Recognizing the immense power of the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal army]] (which had 4 million armed soldiers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:01">[02:38:01]</a>, they opted for friendly relations to secure trading permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:01">[02:46:01]</a>. Captain William Hawkins traveled to Agra, the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal Capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:01">[02:54:01]</a>, to meet Emperor Jahangir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:01">[03:04:01]</a>. However, Jahangir refused their request to set up a factory in Surat due to existing good relations with Portuguese traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:01">[03:13:01]</a>.

The EIC then sought permission in non-[[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal]] territories, successfully establishing their first factory in Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh, in 1611 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:01">[03:32:01]</a>. After defeating Portuguese traders in the Battle of Swally in 1612 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:01">[04:01:01]</a>, the EIC's influence grew, becoming a major player in the subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:01">[04:16:01]</a>.

In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe, a diplomat sent by English King James I, successfully impressed Jahangir with gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:01">[04:23:01]</a>. This led to a royal edict permitting the English to set up factories in Surat and granting the EIC exclusive trading rights in certain territories in exchange for an annual payment to the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal Emperor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:01">[04:48:01]</a>. Over subsequent decades, the EIC established factories in Madras, Ahmedabad, Bombay, Agra, and Patna, and its business flourished through trade in cotton, indigo, silk, salt, opium, and tea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:01">[05:14:01]</a>.

## Escalation and the First Anglo-Mughal War
By 1670, English King Charles II granted the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] extensive powers, including the right to acquire territories, hold political power, mint money, oversee civil and criminal jurisdiction, maintain a private army, form alliances, and even declare wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:01">[06:21:01]</a>. This transformed the EIC into an agent of imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>.

In 1682, the EIC attempted to negotiate with Shaista Khan, the then [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal]] Governor of Bengal, for easier trade and tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:01">[07:17:01]</a>. However, the new [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal Emperor]], [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maraj | Aurangzeb]], viewed their request as arrogant and rejected their petition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:01">[07:38:01]</a>. In response, Josiah Child, the EIC Governor, declared war on the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughals]] in 1686 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:01">[08:01:01]</a>.

The EIC faced a devastating defeat due to their army's inferiority compared to the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal army]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:01">[08:13:01]</a>. Josiah Child was forced to apologize and seek [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maraj | Aurangzeb]]'s forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:01">[08:21:01]</a>. [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maraj | Aurangzeb]] forgave the EIC but levied a fine of ₹150,000 (equivalent to ₹350 million today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:01">[08:30:01]</a>. After this, the EIC's trading privileges and seized factories were restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:01">[08:39:01]</a>.

## [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal]] Decline and EIC Expansion
The death of [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maraj | Aurangzeb]] in 1707 significantly weakened the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:01">[09:02:01]</a>. Constant power struggles and infighting among the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughals]] led to local Nawabs and kings asserting sovereign control over their regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:01">[09:09:01]</a>. Regional powers like the Marathas, Rajputs, Jats, and Rohillas emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:01">[09:24:01]</a>. Further weakening came from Persian invasions (Nadir Shah in 1739) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:01">[09:47:01]</a> and financial problems as regional governors stopped paying revenue to the central [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal]] government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:01">[10:10:01]</a>.

Amidst this decentralization, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] focused on strengthening itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:01">[10:25:01]</a>. They invested in new technologies, set up more factories, and recruited soldiers from Great Britain for their private army, known as Sepoys (local Indians trained to work for the EIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:01">[10:28:01]</a>.

In 1717, after continuous pressure and manipulation tactics, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] secured tax-free trading rights in Bengal from the then [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal]] Emperor Farrukhsiyar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:01">[11:12:01]</a>. This royal edict also granted the EIC the right to issue *Dastaks* (trade permits) that waived all customs and transit duties on their goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:01">[11:23:01]</a>. This was a massive advantage for the EIC, as it eliminated revenue for the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal Empire]] from Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:01">[11:47:01]</a>.

## Direct Intervention in Politics: Bengal
In the same year, 1717, Murshid Quli Khan, the [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal]] Governor of Bengal, declared himself the independent Nawab of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:01">[12:02:01]</a>. He understood the EIC's tactics and ordered them to pay taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:01">[12:13:01]</a>. The EIC, viewing the demand as unfair, decided to intervene in local politics to protect its profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:01">[12:28:01]</a>.

During this period, other [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the_17th_and_18th_centuries | European powers in India]], such as the Dutch, Danes, and particularly the French, also sought to expand their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:01">[12:42:01]</a>. The British and French became dominant forces, clashing in the Carnatic Wars (1746-1763) in Southern India, which the English won, diminishing French political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:01">[13:17:01]</a>. Indian rulers, observing the superior European armies, formed alliances with them, inadvertently becoming dependent and allowing interference in their domestic politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:01">[14:25:01]</a>. This allowed the EIC to bribe opposition leaders, support them with their army, and install puppet rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:01">[14:51:01]</a>.

In 1756, Siraj-ud-Daulah became the new Nawab of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:01">[15:04:01]</a>. Disgusted by the EIC's constant disrespect for his authority, he attacked Fort William in Calcutta, resulting in the "Black Hole Tragedy" where many British officers died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:01">[15:19:01]</a>. The British, led by Robert Clive, resolved to remove Siraj-ud-Daulah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:01">[15:42:01]</a>. They formed an alliance with his rivals, including the wealthy Jagath Seth family and Mir Jafar, the commander of Siraj-ud-Daulah's army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:01">[15:53:01]</a>. Siraj-ud-Daulah, in turn, allied with the French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:01">[16:52:01]</a>.

This culminated in the **Battle of Plassey** in June 1757 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:01">[17:01:01]</a>. Despite having an army 15 times larger, Siraj-ud-Daulah lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:01">[17:06:01]</a>. The British installed Mir Jafar as the new puppet Nawab of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:01">[17:11:01]</a>, and Siraj-ud-Daulah was assassinated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:01">[17:18:01]</a>. The French presence in Bengal also ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:01">[17:20:01]</a>. The Battle of Plassey was a turning point, marking the EIC's direct acquisition of political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:01">[17:31:01]</a>.

Mir Jafar later attempted to ally with the Dutch [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] to expel the British, leading to his removal and replacement by his son-in-law, Mir Qasim, in 1761 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:01">[17:49:01]</a>. However, Mir Qasim also resisted British interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:01">[18:14:01]</a>. In 1763, he waged war against the British but was defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:01">[18:25:01]</a>. Mir Jafar was reinstated as Nawab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:01">[18:35:01]</a>.

Mir Qasim then formed an alliance with the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daula, and the incumbent [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal Emperor]], Shah Alam II, to eradicate British influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:01">[18:48:01]</a>. Their combined forces fought the British in the **Battle of Buxar** in 1764, but the British again emerged victorious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:01">[19:07:01]</a>.

## Formal Control and the End of Mughal Authority
Following the Battle of Buxar, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] decided to end the system of puppet rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:01">[19:15:01]</a>. In 1765, the Treaty of Allahabad officially made Robert Clive the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:01">[19:26:01]</a>. A key provision of this treaty was Shah Alam II granting the Diwani Rights of Bengal to the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:01">[19:33:01]</a>. This meant all revenue from taxes collected in Bengal would go solely to the EIC, officially establishing them as the new rulers of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:01">[19:41:01]</a>. The EIC's revenue significantly increased, allowing them to fund more trade, strengthen their military, and invest in infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:01">[19:52:01]</a>.

Through various strategies, including appointing Residents in local states to indirectly interfere in politics, imposing Subsidiary Alliances (where local rulers paid the EIC for an army and forfeited territory if unable to pay), and direct military force, the EIC gradually gained control over the Indian subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:01">[20:30:01]</a>. The Doctrine of Lapse, introduced in 1847 and enforced by Lord Dalhousie, further allowed the EIC to annex kingdoms without a natural male heir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:01">[23:00:01]</a>, including Satara, Udaipur, Nagpur, Jhansi, and Awadh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:01">[23:32:01]</a>.

By 1818, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] controlled about two-thirds of the Indian subcontinent, with 78% of the population living under its rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:01">[22:43:01]</a>. The **Revolt of 1857**, also known as the First War of Independence, though unsuccessful for Indian revolutionaries, led to the British government nationalizing the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] under the Government of India Act of 1858 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:01">[24:25:01]</a>. All EIC territories, military forces, and wealth were transferred to the British government, marking the end of EIC rule and the beginning of the [[british_expansion_and_control_in_india_leading_to_the_british_raj | British Raj]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:01">[24:40:01]</a>. The [[mughal_empires_history_and_administration | Mughal Empire]] officially ended after 1857, with the exile of the last emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, to Burma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:56:01">[24:56:01]</a>.

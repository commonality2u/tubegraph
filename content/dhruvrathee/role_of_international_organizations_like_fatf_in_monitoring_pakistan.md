International organizations play a crucial role in monitoring Pakistan, particularly concerning its links to terrorism and financial illicit activities. These bodies, such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), assess Pakistan's compliance with global security and financial regulations.

## Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an organization dedicated to monitoring global money laundering and terror financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. It uses a "grey list" or "black list" to categorize countries based on their connections to terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

Pakistan has been placed on FATF's increased monitoring grey list three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. The most recent instance occurred in June 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. In response, FATF provided Pakistan with a 34-item action plan to address issues related to terror financing and money laundering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. Pakistan pledged to act on these items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a> and was subsequently removed from the grey list in October 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

### Post-Removal Concerns
However, concerns quickly emerged after Pakistan's removal from the grey list. Satellite images analyzed by Damien Simon, a Geo Intelligence researcher at Intel Labs, showed that Jaish-e-Mohammed's base in Bahawalpur had doubled in size compared to 2011-2012, spreading over 18 acres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. The pace of construction at this facility reportedly increased after Pakistan's removal from the FATF grey list in late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. An India Today investigation found that a Jaish-e-Mohammed gathering was held at the Osman O Ali campus on February 16, a place used for terrorist recruitment and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

A December 2024 report by Antoine Colonna in the French magazine *Spectacle Dumon* detailed Jaish-e-Mohammed's activities, noting two hideouts in Bahawalpur—Markaz Subhan Allah and Usman o Ali Mosque—serving as indoctrination and training centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. These sites reportedly operate openly, with one complex located just 8km from a Pakistani military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. The Print reported in October 2022 that Jaish-e-Mohammed had purchased an additional 4 acres of land for expansion in Bahawalpur, with the land sold by a local numberdar to Abdul Rauf, brother of Masood Azhar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

## International Monetary Fund (IMF)
The IMF has also faced scrutiny regarding its financial support to Pakistan. The organization approved a loan package of $2.3 billion for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>. AIMIM leader Owaisi criticized this decision, calling the fund the "International Militant Fund" instead of International Monetary Funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. He expressed surprise that countries like the USA, Germany, and Japan agreed to the loan, given that Pakistani actions lead to attacks on Indian land, homes, and soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.

## United Nations (UN)
The United Nations has also taken actions against individuals and groups linked to terrorism in Pakistan:
*   Hafiz Saeed, leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba, was designated a terrorist by the United Nations in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   Masood Azhar, head of Jaish-e-Mohammed, was added to the UN's terrorist list in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   The UN Security Council has stated that Lashkar-e-Taiba has carried out many terror operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.
*   Lashkar-e-Taiba's charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, has been banned by the UN, along with the US and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.

## Other International Entities
*   The US placed a $1 million bounty on Hafiz Saeed in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   Abdul Rauf, brother of Masood Azhar, was declared a designated terrorist by America in 2010 due to his responsibility for attacks in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.
*   The 2024 Global Peace Index report ranked Pakistan 1140 out of 1163 countries, highlighting the unsafe living conditions due to [[impact_of_terrorism_on_pakistans_internal_security_and_society | terrorism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>.

These instances underscore the ongoing challenge for international organizations in ensuring Pakistan's compliance with anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering frameworks, amidst persistent evidence of [[pakistans_support_of_terrorism | Pakistan's support of terrorism]].

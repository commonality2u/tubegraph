The depths of the oceans are home to a vast array of creatures, many of which remain mysterious to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Recently, there has been an increase in sightings of these deep-sea organisms at surface levels, prompting questions about why they are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Unexplored Depths

Oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, with 97% of Earth's water contained within the five main oceans: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Southern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. These oceans host 94% of the world's wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Despite this, humans have only explored and mapped approximately 5% of the oceans, leaving the deep sea largely a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. We possess better maps of Mars than the ocean floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, and only three individuals have ever reached the Challenger Deep, the deepest point of the sea, for a mere three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Ocean Zones

The ocean is divided into several zones based on depth and light penetration:

*   **Sunlight Zone (0-200 meters)**: This is the topmost layer where sunlight can reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It is the most colorful and diverse oceanic area, allowing for photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Macro algae and phytoplankton, which form the base of the oceanic food chain, are found here, along with whales, sharks, turtles, and dolphins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. At 10 meters, only 16% of sunlight remains, dropping to 1% by 100 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Twilight Zone (200-1,000 meters)**: Beyond 1,000 meters, light cannot penetrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. In the Twilight Zone, water absorbs longer wavelengths of light first, meaning only blue and violet light reach these depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Strange creatures begin to appear here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Midnight Zone (1,000-4,000 meters)**: Sunlight does not reach this zone at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Creatures living here often migrate between the twilight and midnight zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The Titanic wreck lies in this zone at about 3,810 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Abyssal Zone (4,000-6,000 meters)**: This zone is largely unexplored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Creatures found here are unique and exist nowhere else on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Hadal Zone (6,000-11,000 meters)**: This is the deepest part of the oceans and remains full of mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Amazing Deep Sea Creatures

The deep sea is vastly different from life on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Many deep sea creatures have unique adaptations to survive in their dark, high-pressure environments.

*   **Sea Devil (Anglerfish)**: This scary-looking fish carries a torch-like lure on its head to attract prey into its mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its reproduction strategy is unusual: male anglerfish are one-tenth the size of females and merge with the female's body, sharing blood and becoming an organ for reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Females can have multiple males attached to their bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **[[oarfish_and_japanese_folklore | Deep Sea Oarfish]]**: Typically found around 1 km below the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, sightings of oarfish above water have long been considered a sign of disaster, especially earthquakes, in Japanese folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Before the devastating 2011 earthquake in Japan, about 20 dead oarfish were found on the coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. However, increased global sightings in recent years, including a fisherman catching 50 in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> and multiple sightings in California and Mexico in 2024-2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, question these traditional beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. A live oarfish was first filmed only in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Giant Phantom Jellyfish**: These amazing creatures have ribbon-like tentacles over 10 meters long and are usually found 1-2 km deep, but have been spotted at shallower depths of 80 meters in Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Smooth Lumpfish**: Discovered by fishermen in Russia, this creature was initially believed to be an alien due to its brain-like body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Strawberry Squid**: This squid has one eye larger than the other, which helps it see into different light levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Its red color acts as camouflage in the twilight zone where red light doesn't penetrate, making it appear black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Bloody-Belly Comb Jelly**: Often fluorescent red, these creatures are camouflaged in the deep sea because most deep-sea organisms cannot see red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. They exhibit flickering, colorful lights due to bioluminescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Sea Angel**: A beautiful, blind creature smaller than a human finger, its empty stomach glows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. It can quickly transform, using tentacles to form an inescapable trap for prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Barreleye Fish**: Found at 600-800 meters, this fish has a transparent, dome-like head and eyes that are green bulbs capable of rotating to look upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Giant Squid**: Reaching 13 meters in length (equivalent to a two-story house), these terrifying squids have the largest eyes of any living being on Earth (25-30 cm in diameter), adapted for finding prey in dark waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Vampire Squid**: The last remaining species of its order, whose relatives died 200 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Its eight legs are connected by a cloak-like webbing, resembling a vampire's cape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Despite its name, it feeds on detritus, including poop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Yeti Crab**: Living at 2,000-3,000 meters, this blind crab is nicknamed "Yeti" due to the fur covering its arms, which are actually bacterial colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. It farms and eats sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, thriving near hydrothermal vents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Dumbo Octopus**: Named for its large, ear-like fins that resemble Disney's Dumbo, this octopus lives its entire life in the deep sea without migrating to shallower levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. They are considered among the cutest deep-sea animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Scaly-Foot Snail**: Found near hydrothermal vents on the deep sea floor, this snail has legs made of iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. It possesses the largest heart relative to its body volume (4%) among all animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Bioluminescence

Many deep-sea creatures emit light through a process called bioluminescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This occurs when two chemicals, luciferin and luciferase, react, releasing energy as light instead of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This light is used for hiding, attracting prey, or communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Why Are Deep Sea Creatures Coming Up?

The recent increase in sightings of deep sea creatures at the surface is a cause for concern.

### [[diel_vertical_migration_of_marine_life | Diel Vertical Migration]] (DVM)

During World War II, sonar operators observed a "Deep Scattering Layer" where the apparent sea floor rose hundreds of meters at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This phenomenon was later understood to be the largest migration on Earth: billions of fish, squids, and plankton swimming upwards every night towards the surface to feed, and then returning to the depths before daybreak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This daily upward and downward movement is known as the [[diel_vertical_migration_of_marine_life | Diel Vertical Migration]] (DVM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. They undertake this journey to feed on phytoplankton near the surface, where photosynthesis occurs, while avoiding predators like sharks and whales during daylight hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### [[impact_of_climate_change_on_marine_life | Impact of Climate Change on Marine Life]]

While DVM is a natural occurrence, recent observations suggest a shift from daily migration to permanent migration for many deep-sea species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This is primarily due to [[impact_of_climate_change_on_marine_life | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>:

*   **Ocean Warming**: The oceans absorb over 90% of the heat generated by global warming, causing temperatures, which had been stable for hundreds of thousands of years, to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Warm surface water, being lighter and less dense, remains separate from the cold deep-sea water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Depletion**: The lack of mixing between warm surface water and cold deep water leads to an oxygen shortage in the deep sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Deep-sea creatures have evolved in stable oxygen environments, and even a slight shortage can lead to large-scale population decline and extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **Migration to Surface**: In search of oxygen, these creatures are migrating towards the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This is dangerous for them as they are not evolved to live in surface waters and become easy prey for predators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Scientists predict that by the end of the century, the Abyssal zone's temperature could increase by 1° Celsius, causing deep-sea creatures to migrate 4 to 11 times faster than surface species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

These changes threaten the future of many amazing, and in some cases, yet-undiscovered, deep-sea creatures with extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>. The deep sea also plays a crucial role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide by storing large quantities of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, a capacity that is decreasing due to [[impact_of_climate_change_on_marine_life | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

## Threats to Deep Sea Life

### [[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | Deep Sea Mining]]

Beyond [[impact_of_climate_change_on_marine_life | climate change]], [[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | deep sea mining]] poses an immediate threat to deep sea creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Mining companies are seeking to extract gold and silver from areas near hydrothermal vents, where unique creatures like the Scaly-Foot Snail live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This involves sending large machines to dig in the deep seas, causing large-scale destruction to delicate ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

The United Nations' International Seabed Authority grants permission for deep sea mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. While no country has yet received permission, there is immense pressure for it to be granted, potentially this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. Many NGOs and activists, alongside 32 countries, have openly voiced opposition to deep sea mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. Organizations like Greenpeace have launched petitions to "Stop Deep Sea Mining Before It Starts," which has garnered over 3 million signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition also works to highlight the dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

As Mahatma Gandhi stated, "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Protecting the deep sea from this destruction is considered a "once in a generation" opportunity, as widespread damage has not yet reached these pristine environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

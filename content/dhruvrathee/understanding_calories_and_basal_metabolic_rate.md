Weight [[scientific_methods_for_weight_loss | loss]] is one of the most searched questions on the internet and a popular New Year's resolution globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Many rumors and conflicting advice exist, from specific [[impact_of_different_types_of_diets_on_weight_loss | diets]] like low-carb or low-fat, to claims about "fake products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. A whole industry has been built around [[scientific_methods_for_weight_loss | weight loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Understanding the concept of [[scientific_methods_for_weight_loss | weight loss]] from a [[scientific_methods_for_weight_loss | scientific way]] helps distinguish truth from myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Calorie Bank Concept

The fundamental principle behind [[scientific_methods_for_weight_loss | weight loss]] is simple: it operates like a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. In the body, this is a "calorie bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Calories consumed accumulate, and calories spent are deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Excess calories are converted into fat and stored, increasing weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. To lose weight, one must either reduce calorie intake or increase calorie expenditure, known as "burning calories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Sources of Calories

Calories, defined as a unit of energy in nutritional science, come from the food and drinks we consume, excluding water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Burning Calories

Calories are burned for every process where the body uses energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

#### Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

Beyond [[role_of_diet_and_exercise_in_weight_management | exercising]], calories are continuously burned to keep the body alive, even while sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This includes essential functions like heartbeat, breathing, and food digestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This baseline calorie expenditure is known as the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. On average, a person burns about 400 calories during 8 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. BMR varies for each individual, depending on factors like height, weight, and muscle mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. For example, a 28-year-old male with a height of 186 cm and weight of 80 kg has a BMR of 1828 calories per day, meaning these calories are burned without any additional activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

#### Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)

Another way calories are burned is through the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. When food is eaten, the body expends energy to digest, absorb nutrients, and store it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Low TEF foods**: Fats, oil, flour, and butter are easily digested, requiring minimal calorie burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **High TEF foods**: Whole grains, protein-rich foods (dairy, eggs), and high-fiber vegetables (spinach, broccoli) require more calories to digest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This makes it difficult to gain weight from these foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

It is a myth that some foods provide "negative calories" (where the body burns more calories to consume the food than the food itself contains) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The highest possible thermic effect is around 30%, typically found in proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This means 100 calories of protein would result in a net gain of 70 calories after digestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Connection to Healthy Weight Loss

While theoretically possible to lose weight by consuming fewer calories than your BMR without [[role_of_diet_and_exercise_in_weight_management | exercise]], this is practically very dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It can disrupt hormonal balance, lead to fatigue, irritability, difficulty focusing, and self-control issues, often resulting in diet failure and binging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The brain alone consumes almost 20% of the body's energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Therefore, the goal should be [[scientific_methods_for_weight_loss | healthy weight loss]], not just weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. For healthy [[scientific_methods_for_weight_loss | weight loss]], four main things are crucial:
1.  [[role_of_diet_and_exercise_in_weight_management | Diet]] control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
2.  [[role_of_diet_and_exercise_in_weight_management | Exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
3.  Proper sleep (7-9 hours daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>
4.  Keeping oneself stress-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>

Stress significantly links to weight gain, as it increases cortisol levels, which reduces metabolism and increases cravings for fat and [[impact_of_sugar_on_health_and_alternatives_to_sugary_drinks | sugar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. Managing stress through meditation, sports, or social interaction is important for [[scientific_methods_for_weight_loss | weight loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Ultimately, [[scientific_methods_for_weight_loss | weight loss]] is primarily driven by a Calorie Deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This means controlling calorie intake and increasing calories burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The calories consumed should come from a nutritious, [[importance_of_a_balanced_diet_and_healthy_lifestyle | balanced diet]] with whole grains, fibrous fruits, vegetables, and proteins to promote satiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. Avoiding refined flour, added [[impact_of_sugar_on_health_and_alternatives_to_sugary_drinks | sugar]], bad oils (trans fats), and packaged foods can reduce cravings and encourage healthier nutrient intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. Daily physical activity and a routine including cardio, strength training, and stretching are also essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. It's important to remember that "spot reduction" of fat is a myth, as the body decides where fat is burned based on genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

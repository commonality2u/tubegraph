The phenomenon often referred to as "demonic possession" is explained through a scientific lens by **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This condition, previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, involves a person having multiple distinct personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## Understanding Identity

Identity refers to an individual's true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Poet Nida Fazli's lines, "Every man has 10-20 men inside him, Whomever you want to see, make sure you see them more than once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, highlight the complex nature of human identity.

Psychology distinguishes between:
*   **The person you are in reality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   **The person you think you are (Self-image)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, which can be affected by phenomena like the [[psychological_phenomena_like_the_barnum_effect_in_astrology | Dunning-Kruger effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>, where a person overestimates their abilities despite a lack of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.
*   **The person you want to be (Ideal self)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, influenced by social conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

According to Psychologist Carl Rogers, our self-concept is formed by these three components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. A large disparity between one's self-image and ideal self can lead to low self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>, whereas similarity fosters high self-esteem and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. Our self-concept is influenced by habits, environment, things we are proud of or embarrassed about, regrets, secrets, fears, desires, and fantasies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

## Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)

[[dissociative_identity_disorder_did_overview | Dissociative Identity Disorder]] is a mental condition where multiple identities within an individual dissociate into different personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. These different personalities are known as "Alters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. A person can have two, five, or even twenty alters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

### Characteristics of Alters
Alters can have different:
*   Names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>
*   Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>
*   Gender identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>
*   Temperaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>
*   Body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>
*   Memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>

The "Host Identity" or "Primary Identity" is the main personality seen most of the time, often the name a person is born with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. However, an alter can also become the host identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. During a personality switch, the memory of the other personality's actions or experiences often disappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Individuals with DID often do not know they suffer from it, only experiencing frequent memory losses or a lack of proper sense of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

### Case Studies

#### Anneliese Michel
The 2005 Hollywood film *The Exorcism of Emily Rose* was based on the true incident of Anneliese Michel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Anneliese Michel, born in West Germany in 1952, experienced a fainting spell at 16, followed by a trance-like state and night terrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Though doctors initially found nothing wrong, she was later diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

Her condition escalated to dangerous hallucinations, hearing voices, and believing she was cursed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Her behavior included excessive kneeling (up to 600 times a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, barking like a dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, and consuming non-food items like spiders, coal, and birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Believing she was possessed by six demons, including [[historical_interpretations_and_biases | Adolf Hitler]], Roman Emperor Nero, Judas, Cain, Lucifer, and Valentin Fleischmann, she underwent 67 exorcisms over 10 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

Anneliese Michel died from starvation and acute dehydration, weighing only 32 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. Her physicians stated she suffered from:
*   **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>
*   **Anorexia Nervosa:** A mental illness causing distorted perceptions of weight, leading to dangerously low body weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.
*   **Hyper-Religious Personality Disorder:** Intense religious beliefs leading to mystical experiences and delusions about spirituality, often fixating on unholy things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

Her parents' extreme religious upbringing influenced her "demonic" identifications, as she only knew Christian theological figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. Her death was deemed preventable with proper medical assistance, leading to her parents and two priests being convicted of negligent homicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>.

#### Michael Boatwright
An American man named Michael Boatwright was found unconscious and, upon regaining consciousness, began speaking Swedish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. He claimed his name was Johan Ek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. This was later explained as a Dissociative Fugue state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. Boatwright had lived in Sweden for many years (1981-2003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>. Trauma, such as his previous marriages and a son, likely triggered this state, causing him to forget his past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>.

### Root Cause and Treatment for DID
Approximately 90% of DID cases are linked to childhood abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. Trauma leads the brain to dissociate as a coping mechanism, creating mental wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>. While not a safe coping method, it can lead to stress, anxiety, depression, addiction, and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.

Treatment for DID involves psychotherapy, where therapists help patients remember and accept traumatic events from their past to facilitate the reintegration of scattered identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.

### Spectrum of Dissociation
Dissociation exists on a spectrum, with mild cases being common. Studies suggest 50% to 74% of people experience at least one dissociative episode in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.

Mild cases of dissociation include:
*   **Dissociative Amnesia:** Forgetting details of traumatic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.
*   **Dissociative Fugue:** Confusion about past events, often triggered by trauma, leading to travel or adopting a new identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.
*   **Depersonalisation:** Feeling detached from one's own actions, thoughts, and feelings, viewing oneself as an outsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.
*   **Derealisation:** Feeling that the world and people around are unreal, dream-like, with distorted perception of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

### Portrayal in Media
Films often portray DID patients in scary or insensitive ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>. Movies like *Aparichit* and *Psycho* sensationalize the illness by showing patients as violent and dangerous, adding to societal stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>. In reality, most DID patients are not violent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>. Some films, like *Karthik Calling Karthik* and the web series *Opri Paraai*, offer more sensitive and accurate portrayals of therapy techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>.

It is crucial to remove the stigma around mental illnesses and encourage individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, or depression to consult a psychotherapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>.

The film *Jawan* highlights how corporate money is secretly used to fund political parties in India, drawing inspiration from real-life incidents and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Electoral Bonds and Secret Funding

A significant development regarding political funding occurred in 2017 when the Modi government passed the Finance Bill, 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This bill permitted secret donations to political parties through [[Electoral Bonds | Electoral Bonds]] and removed limits on the amount of money that could be donated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

According to a report published in January, between 2018 and 2022:
*   The BJP secretly received ₹52.70 billion in funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   The Congress party received ₹9.60 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   Trinamool Congress received ₹7.67 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

The purpose of this bill was to conceal the sources of funding, preventing the public from knowing who is funding political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This contrasts with Narendra Modi's 2014 promise to bring black money back from Swiss banks to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Campaign Expenditure and Discrepancies

There is an official expenditure limit for political candidates during campaigns, which varies by state, but for Lok Sabha elections, it ranges from ₹7.5 million to ₹9.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Technically, no political party should spend more than approximately ₹5 billion for all 543 Lok Sabha seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

However, a Centre for Media Studies report indicated that the BJP spent ₹270 billion in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Even the BJP's own submission to the Election Commission in November 2019 stated an expenditure of ₹12.64 billion for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, significantly exceeding the maximum allowed limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Influence of Political Donations

The film *Jawan* suggests that foreign investors are encouraged to invest in winning elections and donating to political parties, in exchange for the freedom to operate businesses in India without stringent regulations, including setting up factories, utilizing cheap labor, and disregarding environmental pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This points to the [[Influence of Political Donations on Government Contracts | influence of political donations on government contracts]] and policy-making.

### Environmental Deregulation
The film's villain claims that India's environmental regulations are favorable for big companies, lacking the restrictions found in developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. An example cited is the continued allowance of certain dangerous pesticides in India that are banned elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Despite committees recommending bans on numerous pesticides since 2013, government action has been slow, with only a few being banned or phased out over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The Supreme Court has questioned the government's tendency to form multiple committees instead of taking action on reports regarding dangerous pesticides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. This inaction is attributed to a focus on "crony capitalists" rather than citizens, to avoid affecting the businesses of billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

### Food Safety Regulations
Another area of concern is food safety. In 2017, experts reported that Indian poultry farms were using antibiotics in doses that were leading to antibiotic resistance in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. While the government set a permissible limit for antibiotics in hens in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, a 2018 study by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that "last resort" antibiotics like Colistin were being heavily administered to chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This antibiotic was finally banned by the Union Health Ministries only in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

The European Union, in contrast, banned antibiotics in animal feed in 2006 and, in January of the current year, implemented new legislation banning all types of antibiotics in farming and prohibiting the import of meat containing antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. Multinational food companies like KFC, Burger King, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell committed to not using antibiotics in their chicken in America by 2017, but similar commitments have not been made or responded to by these companies in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. This highlights a lack of [[Transparency and Accountability in Political Funding | transparency and accountability]] and suggests an [[Influence of Political Donations on Government Contracts | influence of political donations]] leading to leniency in regulations.

### Loan Write-Offs and Debt
The film also depicts the government forgiving bad loans of billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. In real life, the Minister of State for Finance reported in the Lok Sabha last month that banks had written off ₹14.56 trillion in Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) over the past nine years, with over half owed by large corporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated in March that public sector banks only recovered 14% of these written-off loans in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

This situation is contrasted with the struggles of farmers. An India Spend report from 2019 showed that the cost of the top 12 corporate NPAs (₹3.45 billion) was nearly double the total amount of farm loan waivers issued by 10 state governments between FY 2017-18 and February 2019 (₹1.848 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. While farmers often resort to suicide due to inability to repay loans, there are no reported cases of billionaires doing the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. In 2021 alone, over 10,000 people in the farm sector committed suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. This disparity points towards [[Scams and Corruption in Political Donations | scams and corruption]] within the system, where political connections and donations may lead to preferential treatment for large corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

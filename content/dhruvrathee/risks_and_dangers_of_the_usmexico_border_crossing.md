The US-Mexico border is recognized as the World's Most Dangerous Border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. While the northern border with Canada can experience extreme temperatures as low as -35°C to -40°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, the southern US-Mexico border presents even greater dangers for individuals attempting to cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## The "Donkey Process" Route from South America

Individuals attempting the [[the_donkey_process_and_illegal_immigration_from_india | donkey process]] often begin their journey in countries like Ecuador or Brazil, where obtaining visas is comparatively easier for Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Before 2019, a visa was not even required for Ecuador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Once there, they embark on an extensive journey covering thousands of kilometers north through Colombia, Panama, and eventually to Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### The Darien Gap

A significant and perilous part of this journey involves crossing the Darien Gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This is a dense jungle over 100 kilometers wide with no roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The terrain consists of mountains, forests, bushes, and rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. There are no government authorities in this area, making it one of the most dangerous places globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Drug cartels and guerrilla groups frequently use this route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Tragically, individuals using this route often fall victim to gang violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Instances have been reported where "donkers" (agents involved in transporting individuals) shoot travelers, especially if agents do not pay them in full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Many lives have been lost this way, with some bodies not being discovered for over three months in the jungle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

> "We came to America through the Donkey way, only four of us have survived. We haven't eaten and have been walking for 5 days straight in these forests of Mexico." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>

### Mexico's Desert and the Border Wall

After surviving the dangers of the Darien Gap, migrants encounter Mexico's scorching desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Finally, they face the imposing wall, most likely constructed during Donald Trump's presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Crossing this barrier presents a formidable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## Fatalities and Risks

The treacherous nature of this journey is highlighted by alarming statistics: in 2021, over 650 people died in a single year while trying to cross the US-Mexico border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

> "People are often brutalised, imprisoned, or some may even lose their lives on the way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>

## Motivations for Taking the Risk

Despite the obvious dangers, people invest millions of rupees (₹2.5 million to ₹6 million, depending on the package chosen from [[role_of_visa_agencies_in_illegal_immigration | visa agencies]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> and willingly jeopardize their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Three main reasons underpin this decision:

1.  **[[economic_motivation_behind_illegal_immigration | Economic Motivation]]:** The primary reason is the pursuit of economic opportunities and the belief in the "American Dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Individuals from lower-middle-class backgrounds often lack the money or qualifications for legal migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Success stories of others who migrated illegally can generate hope and societal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
2.  **Unemployment:** Rising unemployment in their home country, particularly in states like Haryana which had a staggering 37.3% unemployment rate in September 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, drives people to seek this life-threatening path as a better alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Many sell family land and gold to fund this risky endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
3.  **Escaping Political Persecution:** Some individuals flee their home countries due to oppression, discrimination, or threats to their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This includes political, religious, racial, ethnic, caste-based, or social group persecution (e.g., against women or the LGBT+ community) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Seeking Asylum and its Challenges

Most people who cross the border illegally willingly surrender themselves to the Border Patrol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. The primary reason for this is to seek asylum, which is a form of protection granted when a country agrees to protect an individual who faces danger in their home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Asylum is granted only to individuals physically present in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

### [[challenges_faced_by_indian_immigrants_seeking_asylum | Challenges Faced by Asylum Seekers]]

*   **Proof of Claim:** Individuals must present their case in immigration court, providing justification and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. It is crucial to prove that the claims made are genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
*   **Risk of Deportation and Bans:** Many people may lie about their reasons for seeking asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. If caught lying, individuals face deportation, rendering the millions spent useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. Being caught lying can also result in a ban, prohibiting future legal travel to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Lengthy Process:** Processing asylum applications can take months or even years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. Even after living in America for years, there's a risk of deportation if authorities decide the claims were false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
*   **Detention Centers:** Upon crossing the border, individuals are first placed in detention centers, where conditions can be terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. People may be locked in small rooms for weeks or months until authorities call for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

> "The officers are nice... They treat you well here. But as I told you, you're locked inside. You're not free. You're depressed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>

Ultimately, choosing such risky paths and putting one's life at stake is often not worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

Shahrukh Khan's film *Jawan* has gained significant public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. More than half of the incidents portrayed in the film are inspired by real-life events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This article explores the connections between the film's narrative and real-world issues in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Government Hospital Crisis and the Gorakhpur Tragedy

The film *Jawan* features a scene set in a government hospital where young children die from encephalitis due to a lack of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. A diligent doctor, Iram, tries to save the children but is later framed by the government with false accusations and imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

This mirrors a real-life incident in August 2017 in Gorakhpur, where 63 children died within three days at BRD Medical College due to a depleted piped oxygen supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Dr. Kafeel Khan, a pediatrician at the time, attempted to inform authorities and even procured oxygen at his own expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Despite his efforts, blame was shifted onto him, and he was accused of medical negligence and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Dr. Kafeel was suspended, arrested, and spent nine months in jail, where he reported being beaten and starved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

> "They used to make me naked, they used to beat me with a stick. They didn't give me food and water for 4-5 days!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

In April 2018, the Allahabad High Court granted him bail, stating there was no evidence of wrongdoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. An inquiry panel in 2017 also found the allegations against him baseless and inconsistent, noting that his efforts led to the delivery of over 500 jumbo oxygen cylinders to the hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The film's depiction of parents using Ambu bags when oxygen was unavailable also reflects real reports from the Gorakhpur tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Dr. Kafeel stated he was made a scapegoat for a "man-made tragedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, as over 30 letters were sent to authorities about pending bills of ₹6.3 million to oxygen suppliers, which were unpaid for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath, had even visited the hospital a day before the tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

The film suggests that nationwide government hospitals could be improved in just five hours if there is political will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Faulty Weapons in the Indian Military

*Jawan* addresses the issue of soldiers being martyred not by enemy bullets, but by their own faulty weapons, manufactured by "crony capitalists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Real-life reports corroborate this concern:
*   In 2012, Indian Army Chief General V.K. Singh wrote to PM Manmohan Singh about the army's dire need for critical tank ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   In 2015, retired Lieutenant Colonel Deepak Malhotra filed a PIL in Delhi High Court, alleging soldiers used poor quality weapons due to bureaucratic hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This PIL mentioned an injured soldier's account of a massacre in Chhattisgarh due to defective INSAS rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   A 2017 CAG report indicated that 40% of the Indian Army's ammunition was at such low levels that it wouldn't last more than 10 days in a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   In 2018, the Indian Army rejected Made in India rifles for a second time due to their failure in trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   An internal army assessment in 2020 flagged 403 accidents and 27 soldier deaths in the last six years, costing ₹9.6 billion, due to bad weapons supplied by the Ordnance Factory Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   A September 2022 Bloomberg report stated that PM Modi's Make-In-India push prevented defense forces from importing critical weapon systems, making India vulnerable to threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   In the last five years, around 55 soldiers died in over 50 aircraft and helicopter accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. A 2022 report stated that over 400 MiG-21s crashed in the last 60 years, resulting in 200 pilot and 60 civilian deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

This issue was also a major plot point in the film *Rang De Basanti* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Corporate Funding in Politics

*Jawan* portrays how corporate money is secretly used to fund political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

This reflects the real-life introduction of Electoral Bonds by the Modi government through the Finance Bill, 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This allowed secret donations to political parties and removed limits on donation amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

> [!INFO] Secret Funding Amounts (2018-2022)
> A January report revealed that the BJP received ₹52.70 billion in secret funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The Congress party received ₹9.60 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, and Trinamool Congress received ₹7.67 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The identities of these funders remain hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

This contrasts with Narendra Modi's 2014 promise to bring black money back from Swiss banks, stating that every poor Indian would receive ₹1.5-₹2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Campaign expenditure limits for Lok Sabha elections range from ₹7.5 million to ₹9.5 million per candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Theoretically, no political party should spend more than ₹5 billion for all 543 seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. However, a Centre for Media Studies report indicated the BJP spent ₹270 billion in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Even the BJP's submission to the Election Commission stated they spent ₹12.64 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, significantly exceeding the ₹5 billion limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Voter Manipulation

The film's villain tells foreign investors that Indian voters can be bought, suggesting ₹10,000 per voter would secure votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. While the amount may be exaggerated, in reality, votes are often exchanged for goods like chicken or whisky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, seizures worth ₹34.56 billion (including cash, gold, silver, alcohol, and drugs) indicated widespread attempts to influence voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Beyond individual voters, there's a trend of political parties buying MLAs and media houses, who then spread hatred and divide the public to maintain their masters' power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Environmental Pollution and Lax Regulations

*Jawan* raises the issue of industrial factories polluting India's air and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, making a reference to the Bhopal Gas Tragedy of December 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

Real-life incidents of pollution are numerous:
*   In 2006, iron ore mining in Chhattisgarh polluted two rivers, forcing 100 villages to use contaminated water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   A 2013 report by the Center for Science and Environment showed that 80% of Indian sewage is dumped untreated into rivers by thousands of factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   In 2017, Maharashtra's factories were cited for making its rivers the "filthiest in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   In September 2018, Magsaysay Award winner Rajendra Singh stated the government's Namami Ganga project was failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   G.D. Agarwal (Swami Gyan Swaroop Sananand), an IIT pass-out turned sadhu, fasted for 111 days to save the Ganga River, demanding a Ganga Protection Act and a ban on quarrying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. He died from starvation in 2018, after his letter to PM Modi went unanswered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   The Namami Ganga project, with a budget of ₹200 billion and a 2021 deadline, was followed by Namami Ganga Mission 2 in 2023, with a budget of ₹225 billion and a 2026 deadline. Its main objective is only to meet "outdoor bathing" water quality criteria, not to make the water drinkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   A 2021 article highlighted Karnataka dumping 1,746 million litres of sewage into rivers daily, 40% untreated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   In April 2022, the River Hindon in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, was deemed unsafe even for bathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   In September 2022, the River Damodar in Jharkhand became toxic due to local power stations and mining companies dumping ash, causing illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   The Central Pollution Control Board reported in 2023 that 413 industries in Haryana, including 181 in Panipat and over 100 in Gurgaon, discharge untreated waste into rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

The film's villain states that India's environmental regulations are highly favorable for big companies, unlike developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This is exemplified by pesticides banned elsewhere still being allowed in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Pesticide Regulation Inaction
> The Supreme Court heard a petition to ban 116 dangerous pesticides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The Anupam Verma Committee (2013) reviewed 66 pesticides and reported in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. However, the government remained inactive for years, banning only 12 pesticides in 2018 and slowly phasing out 6 others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. An SK Malhotra committee (2020) recommended banning 27 pesticides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, but another committee in 2022 led to only 3 more bans in February 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The Supreme Court questioned this inaction in July 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Food Safety Regulations

The film implicitly touches on food safety. In reality, poultry farms in India use antibiotics extensively, leading to antibiotic resistance in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

While the government set a permissible limit for antibiotics in hens in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>, a 2018 study by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that "India's farmed chickens are dosed with the world's strongest antibiotics," including Colistin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. The Union Health Ministries only banned this antibiotic in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

> [!NOTE] International Comparison
> The European Union banned antibiotics in animal feed in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. By January this year, they banned all antibiotics in farming and prohibited the import of meat containing antibiotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

Multinational food companies like KFC, Burger King, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell pledged not to use antibiotics in their chicken in America by 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, but they made no such commitment in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Loan Write-offs and Farmer Suicides

*Jawan* portrays the government forgiving bad loans of billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

In the last nine years, banks have written off ₹14.56 trillion in Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), with over half owed by large corporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Public sector banks recovered only 14% of these written-off loans in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. This includes cases of billionaires like Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, and Mehul Choksi, who fled the country after taking loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

The film draws a powerful comparison between these loan write-offs and the plight of common farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. An India Spend report from 2019 showed that the cost of the top 12 corporate NPAs (₹3.45 billion) was almost twice the total amount of farm loan waivers (₹1.848 billion) issued by 10 state governments between FY 2017-18 and February 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Farmer Suicides
> While billionaires rarely face consequences for unpaid loans, farmers often commit suicide if they cannot repay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. In 2021 alone, over 10,000 people in the farm sector committed suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

### The Nature Farmer Consumer (NFC) Model

The film highlights the struggles of farmers, contrasting with successful farmers who earn substantial incomes by following the NFC (Nature Farmer Consumer) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. This model generally includes:
1.  **Seed Preservation**: Using seed banks and friendly seed banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
2.  **No Chemical Fertilizers**: Restoring soil fertility with cover crops, increasing microbial activity and nitrogen availability, and using compost pits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
3.  **Soil Testing and Crop Rotation**: Testing soil to determine suitable crops and practicing crop rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
4.  **Intercropping**: Planting multiple crops in one field that support each other instead of monoculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
5.  **Multi-layer Farming**: Growing 3-4 crops at different heights on the same field (e.g., coconut, coffee, black pepper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
6.  **No-Till Farming & Efficient Irrigation**: Avoiding tractors and flood irrigation, instead using techniques like sprinkler or drip irrigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
7.  **Natural Pest Control**: Using marigolds, garlic, or bright-colored sheets instead of pesticides and insecticides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
8.  **Mulching**: Covering remaining soil with organic matter to suppress weeds and retain water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
9.  **Direct-to-Consumer Sales**: Organizing in cooperatives to reach consumers directly, eliminating middlemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

This model makes farmers, consumers, and the environment happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. In contrast, the "corporate model" of farming involves reliance on bought seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, expensive machinery, and burning stubble, leading to less fertile soil, high costs, meager revenue, and environmental harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

The government had promised to double farmers' income by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>, but their condition remains unchanged in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

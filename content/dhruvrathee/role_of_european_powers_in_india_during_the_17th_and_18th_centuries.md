The 17th and 18th centuries marked a pivotal period in Indian history, witnessing the increasing influence and eventual dominance of European powers, particularly the British, Dutch, Portuguese, and French. These foreign entities initially arrived for trade but gradually evolved into political and military forces, fundamentally altering the subcontinent's trajectory.

## Early European Presence and British Entry
The story of European powers in India begins in the year 1600 with the founding of the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | British East India Company]] (EIC) by a group of merchants as a Joint Stock Company [01:21]. Initially, the EIC aimed to trade in spices from the Spice Islands of Southeast Asia [01:40]. Their maiden voyage in 1601 led to the establishment of two factories in Indonesia [01:51].

At this time, [[trade_and_political_strategies_of_the_east_india_company | Spanish and Portuguese traders]] were already active in the Indonesian islands, with Dutch traders recently joining the scene [01:55]. The Dutch company, being more profitable with greater financial resources and a stronger army, soon became the dominant power in the area [02:06]. Recognizing the futility of competing with the Dutch, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | British East India Company]] shifted its focus, eventually turning to India, which was rich in spices and textiles [02:16].

In 1608, EIC merchants landed in Surat, Gujarat, a region then under Mughal rule [02:29]. Aware of the formidable Mughal army, which comprised 4 million armed soldiers, the EIC officials sought to establish friendly relations to secure trading permission [02:38]. Captain William Hawkins travelled to the Mughal capital, Agra, to meet Emperor Jahangir, requesting permission to set up a factory in Surat [02:54]. However, Jahangir refused, primarily due to his existing good relations with Portuguese traders in Surat, making him disinclined to support their English competitors [03:13].

Undeterred, the EIC traders moved to areas not controlled by the Mughals, successfully establishing their first factory in Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh, in 1611 with permission from the local ruler [03:32].

### Conflicts with Other European Powers
As the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | British East India Company]] gained a foothold in the Indian subcontinent, it frequently clashed with other European traders [03:56]. In 1612, they returned to Surat and declared war against the Portuguese traders in the Battle of Swally [04:01]. The Portuguese lost, leading to a significant decline in their influence, largely restricting them to areas around Goa [04:08]. The EIC subsequently emerged as a major player in the Indian subcontinent [04:16].

Following this victory, in 1615, the EIC requested King James I of England to send a royal representative to the Mughal emperor [04:20]. Sir Thomas Roe, a diplomat, successfully impressed Jahangir with gifts, leading the emperor to issue a royal edict in 1617. This order permitted the English to establish factories in Surat and granted the EIC exclusive trading rights in certain territories in exchange for an annual payment to the Mughal emperor [04:35]. This marked a significant breakthrough, leading to the establishment of EIC factories in Surat, and later in Madras, Ahmedabad, Bombay, Agra, and Patna [05:10]. The company's business flourished through trade in cotton, indigo, silk, salt, and later opium and tea [05:21].

## The Rise of Political Ambitions and Conflict with Mughals
By the late 17th century, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]]'s ambitions extended beyond trade; they sought political power to facilitate easier trade and eliminate competitors [06:03]. Around 1670, English King Charles II granted the EIC extensive rights, including the power to acquire territories, hold political power, mint money, oversee civil and criminal jurisdiction, maintain a private army, form alliances, and even declare wars [06:21]. This transformation effectively allowed the EIC to act as an agent of imperialism [07:08].

In 1682, the EIC attempted to negotiate with Shaista Khan, the Mughal Governor of Bengal, for easier trading rights and tax cuts in the commercially successful region [07:17]. However, Emperor Aurangzeb, who viewed the EIC's demands as arrogant, rejected their petition [07:38]. In 1686, emboldened by its newfound powers, the EIC's Governor, Josiah Child, declared war on the Mughals [07:53]. This decision proved to be a "big blunder" as the EIC's army was significantly smaller and weaker than the Mughal forces [00:08]. The Mughals easily defeated the EIC, seizing their factories and arresting many officials [00:19]. Josiah Child was forced to apologize and pay a fine of ₹150,000 (equivalent to ₹350 million today) to Aurangzeb [08:21]. Despite this defeat, the EIC's trading privileges and seized factories were eventually restored [08:30].

## Mughal Decline and European Expansion
The death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 marked a significant turning point, as the Mughal Empire greatly weakened, leading to constant power struggles and infighting [09:02]. Local Nawabs, kings, and landlords asserted their sovereign control over their regions, and regional powers such as the Marathas, Rajputs, Jats, and Rohillas emerged [09:16]. The Maratha Empire, already a threat during Aurangzeb's reign, expanded its territory significantly after his death [09:29]. Further destabilizing the Mughals were invasions by Persian ruler Nadir Shah in 1739 and Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1748 [09:47]. The Mughal Empire also faced financial problems as regional governors stopped paying revenue to the central government, leading to further decentralization [10:10].

Amidst this fragmentation, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] strengthened itself by investing in new technologies, setting up more factories, recruiting British soldiers, and training local Indians (Sepoys) for its private army [10:25]. The EIC persistently sought trading privileges in Bengal, finally succeeding in 1717 when Emperor Farrukhsiyar granted them tax-free trading rights and the right to issue 'Dastaks' (trade permits) to waive customs duties [11:12]. This "huge win" for the company meant the loss of significant revenue for the Mughal Empire [11:36].

In the same year, 1717, Murshid Quli Khan, the Mughal Governor of Bengal, declared himself the Nawab of Bengal, forsaking the Mughal Empire [12:02]. Recognizing the EIC's tactics, he ordered them to pay taxes, but EIC officials resisted, leading to their decision to interfere in local politics [12:13].

### Escalating European Rivalry: The Carnatic Wars
The weakening Mughal Empire also benefited other European competitors like the Dutch, Danes, and particularly the French [12:36]. The French rapidly gained territory, establishing colonies in Pondicherry and Chandannagar (Bengal) [13:08]. By the mid-1700s, the British and French emerged as the two dominant European powers in India [13:15].

The rivalry between France and Britain, already present in Europe (War of Austrian Succession, Seven Years' War), extended to India [13:37]. Between 1746 and 1763, the [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | Carnatic Wars]] were fought in Southern India [14:02]. England emerged victorious, diminishing French political influence to only Pondicherry and Chandernagore [14:07].

This period also saw Indian rulers engaging in internal power struggles [14:25]. Observing the superior armies and disciplined soldiers of the Europeans, Indian rulers began forming alliances with them, seeking European resources for their battles [14:29]. However, this led to dependence and European interference in domestic politics, eroding local power [14:39]. European powers exploited this by bribing opposition leaders, supporting them with their armies, and installing "puppet rulers" [14:50].

## British Hegemony in Bengal: The Battles of Plassey and Buxar
In 1756, Siraj-ud-Daulah became the new Nawab of Bengal [15:04]. Annoyed by the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]]'s persistent disrespect, he attacked Fort William in Calcutta and jailed several British officers in the "Black Hole Tragedy of Calcutta" [15:16]. Infuriated, the British, under Robert Clive, decided to remove Siraj-ud-Daulah from power [15:42].

Applying tactics learned in the Carnatic Wars, the British allied with Siraj-ud-Daulah's rivals, including the influential Jagath Seth family of bankers and his army commander, Mir Jafar, who desired the Nawabship [15:48]. Siraj-ud-Daulah, aware of the conspiracy, sought an alliance with the French [16:42].

The **Battle of Plassey** was fought in June 1757 [17:01]. Despite Siraj-ud-Daulah's army being 15 times larger, he lost the battle [17:06]. The British installed Mir Jafar as the new puppet Nawab of Bengal, and Siraj-ud-Daulah was assassinated [17:11]. The French presence in Bengal ended, with Chandernagore falling under British control [17:20]. The Battle of Plassey was a crucial turning point, marking the British acquisition of indirect political power [17:31].

However, Mir Jafar soon disagreed with the EIC, forming an alliance with the Dutch East India Company to expel the British from Bengal [17:39]. The EIC promptly removed him, replacing him with his son-in-law, Mir Qasim, in 1761, hoping for a more compliant puppet [18:00]. Mir Qasim, however, also resisted British misuse of power, leading him to wage war against the British in 1763 [18:14]. Defeated, Mir Qasim fled Bengal, realizing he could not defeat the British alone [18:30]. He formed an alliance with the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daula, and the incumbent Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II [18:48].

This alliance fought the British in the **Battle of Buxar** in 1764, which the British also won [19:07]. Following this victory, the EIC, tired of puppet rulers, decided to directly govern Bengal [19:15]. In 1765, the Treaty of Allahabad officially made Robert Clive the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bengal [19:26]. Crucially, Shah Alam II granted the EIC the 'Diwani Rights' of Bengal, meaning all revenue from taxes would go to the EIC alone [19:37]. Officially, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] became the new ruler of Bengal, significantly increasing its revenue and military power [19:48].

## Methods of Expansion and Control
With Bengal under their control, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] employed several techniques to expand its territory across India:
1.  **Appointment of Residents**: British officials were appointed as diplomats in non-British controlled regions to establish friendly relations with local rulers and subtly interfere in their politics [20:36].
2.  **Subsidiary Alliance**: Local rulers were pressured into alliances where they were forbidden from having their own armies [21:06]. The EIC would form an army on their behalf, for which the rulers paid the EIC [21:21]. If rulers failed to pay, portions of their territory were confiscated, leading to gradual territorial acquisition [21:45]. Hyderabad was the first state to sign such an alliance in 1798 [22:26].
3.  **Brute Military Force**: If other methods failed, the EIC directly occupied new areas with its army [22:34].
4.  **Doctrine of Lapse**: Introduced in 1847 and primarily enforced by Lord Dalhousie (1848-1856), this doctrine stipulated that if an Indian ruler died without a natural male heir, their kingdom would automatically be annexed by the EIC [23:00]. This led to the annexation of states like Satara (1848), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853), Jhansi (1854), and Awadh (1856) [23:31].

By 1818, the [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]] had become the most powerful entity in the Indian subcontinent, controlling about two-thirds of its territory and 78% of its population [22:43]. The company also implemented administrative reforms, such as the Regulating Act of 1773, which created the post of Governor-General of Bengal, with Warren Hastings being the first [23:42].

The remaining major powers, the Maratha Empire and the Mysore Kingdom, were eventually defeated by the EIC [24:10]. The [[british_east_india_company_in_india | East India Company]]'s rule eventually ended with the Revolt of 1857, also known as the First War of Independence [24:25]. Although the Indian revolutionaries lost, the British government nationalized the EIC under the Government of India Act of 1858, transferring all its territories, military forces, and wealth to the British Crown, thus beginning the [[british_expansion_and_control_in_india_leading_to_the_british_raj | British Raj]] [24:34]. The company was finally dissolved in 1874 [24:52].

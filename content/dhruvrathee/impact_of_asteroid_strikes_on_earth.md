For over 170 million years, dinosaurs were the dominant creatures on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These "terrible lizards," as their Greek-derived name suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, could be taller than buildings with jaws capable of crushing bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, approximately 66 million years ago, a catastrophic event caused their complete disappearance from the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## The Cretaceous–Paleogene Extinction Event

About 66 million years ago, a large asteroid, estimated to be 10-15 km in diameter, collided with Earth, marking the end of the Cretaceous period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This impact is widely recognized as the primary cause of the [[extinction_of_dinosaurs_due_to_asteroid_impact | extinction of dinosaurs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### The Impact Itself

The asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, specifically the location where the Mayan tribe would later emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Traveling at 30 km per second, 150 times faster than a jet airliner, the impact created a crater 180 km in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The energy released was equivalent to 100 teratonnes of TNT, which is a billion times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on [[the_impact_of_atomic_bombings_on_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Immediate Effects

The immediate consequences of the impact were devastating:
*   **Disintegration:** Everything near the impact site disintegrated instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Heat Pulse:** The land heated up, raining hot dust over vast areas, causing global temperatures to rise by several degrees for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Animals within thousands of kilometers were cooked alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Only small animals survived by finding shelter underground, underwater, in caves, or inside large tree trunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Shockwaves and Wildfires:** Shockwaves and heat pulses led to widespread wildfires in forests extending for thousands of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **Tsunamis:** A tsunami with a wave estimated at 2 km tall immediately followed the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Volcanic Activity and Acid Rain:** Volcanic eruptions resumed, accompanied by acid rain and earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Long-Term Consequences

The long-term effects were even more catastrophic:
*   **Nuclear Winter:** Dust particles from the impact blocked sunlight globally for the next year, plunging the planet into a "nuclear winter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Freezing Temperatures:** For the next three years, Earth experienced freezing temperatures, killing many plants and animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Collapse:** Without sunlight, plants could not photosynthesize and died, leading to the starvation of herbivorous animals, which in turn caused carnivorous animals to die out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   **Acidification and Global Warming:** The destruction of carbonate rocks released carbon and sulfur into the atmosphere, causing reduced sunlight and continued acid rain for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. After the nuclear winter, the settled dust allowed sunlight to return, but the high concentration of carbon dioxide led to intense global warming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

Ultimately, all terrestrial dinosaurs and over 75% of Earth's plant and animal species went extinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Only small omnivorous animals, such as mammals, lizards, turtles, and some birds, survived by scavenging on dead matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Evidence of the Impact

The evidence for this asteroid strike includes:
*   **Iridium Layer:** Scientists discovered a high concentration of iridium—a rare mineral on Earth but abundant in comets and asteroids—in a specific geological layer dating back 66 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Chicxulub Crater:** The crater, though hidden due to continental shifts, has been confirmed through digging expeditions in the Yucatan Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Half of the crater is submerged under the sea, and the other half is on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Cenotes:** A visible real-world impact are the cenotes in this Mexican area, which form a ring around the crater, part of the world's largest underground cave system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

## Post-Impact Opportunity

The [[extinction_of_dinosaurs_due_to_asteroid_impact | extinction of dinosaurs]] created an opportunity for other animal species, especially mammals, to evolve and fill the ecological niches left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This period, known as the Paleogene, saw the evolution of horses, whales, bats, primates, snakes, and smaller lizards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The only group of dinosaurs that survived were the flying dinosaurs, which gradually evolved into the birds we know today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Studies confirm that birds belong to the same family as dinosaurs, with chickens and ostriches being the closest living relatives of dangerous dinosaurs like T-Rex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Modern Asteroid Risk Management

The possibility of another large asteroid impact remains a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Agencies like NASA continuously track [[Near Earth Objects and Risk Management | Near Earth Asteroids]] (NEAs) to predict their paths and collision probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. As of April 2022, over 28,000 NEAs have been identified, with more than 800 having a diameter of 1 km or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Fortunately, scientific advancements allow for clear prediction of asteroid paths and potential impact locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Furthermore, technology is being developed to prevent future collisions. NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, launched in 2021, successfully demonstrated in September 2022 that a spacecraft could alter an asteroid's path by colliding with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

## The Holocene Extinction Event

While asteroid impacts pose an external threat, scientists believe that Earth is currently experiencing a sixth mass extinction event, the Holocene Extinction Event, driven primarily by human activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. Over the last 100-200 years, biodiversity has been lost at an unprecedented rate due to deforestation, and pollution in oceans and the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. This human-caused extinction rate is 100-1,000 times higher than the normal background rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Thousands of species are endangered or already extinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

International efforts, like the 2010 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity Meeting in Japan, have set targets to mitigate this crisis, with a new plan aiming to protect 30% of land and oceans and reduce pollution by 50% by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. The survival of humanity may depend on these collective efforts to prevent further species extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

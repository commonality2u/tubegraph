Recently, the film *The Kerala Story* garnered significant attention due to its portrayal of a purported secret plot in Kerala to forcefully convert innocent women to Islam and send them to ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The film and its director claimed that approximately 32,000 girls were affected, now allegedly buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Propaganda Techniques

The narrative presented in *The Kerala Story* aligns with propaganda techniques described by historical figures like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### The Big Lie
Adolf Hitler, in his book *Mein Kampf*, discussed a propaganda technique called "Big Lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He suggested that to manipulate people, a lie must be so outrageous that people believe no one could invent such a falsehood, thus convincing them it must contain some truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. When an outrageous lie is told with confidence, some people believe it to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Repetition
Hitler's propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, emphasized the importance of repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Repeating a big lie multiple times, from various sources, makes people more convinced of its veracity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Half-Truth
A third technique involves the use of "Half-Truths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Adding elements of truth to speeches can convince those who might otherwise identify big liars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

These three techniques were utilized to mislead people regarding ISIS recruitment in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Kerala Story: Claims vs. Reality

The film's director, Sudipto Sen, cited several "true incidents" as inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Misleading Citations
*   **Oommen Chandy's Statement**: The director referenced a 2010 statement by former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in the Kerala Assembly, suggesting 2,500 women converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. A 2012 India Today article confirmed Chandy stating that 2,667 women converted to Islam between 2006 and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. However, Chandy explicitly stated his government would not allow forced conversions and would not tolerate hate campaigns against Muslims based on "Love Jihad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, and there was no mention of these women joining ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **V.S. Achuthanandan's Interview**: Another former Chief Minister, V.S. Achuthanandan, was quoted as saying Kerala would become an Islamic state in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The video clip circulated was uploaded by Sunshine Pictures, the same company that produced *The Kerala Story* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The English subtitles in this video were inaccurate, distorting Achuthanandan's actual words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. He was criticizing the Popular Front of India (PFI) for influencing youth by allegedly paying them to marry Muslim women, with no mention of ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Despite the statement, Kerala remains a safe and secular state 13 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **The "Fatima" Character**: The film's teaser showed a character named Fatima imprisoned in Afghanistan, implying a real incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This was a "half-truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Real Cases of ISIS Affiliation from Kerala
A June 2021 article mentioned four women from Kerala who went to Afghanistan with their husbands to join the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) between 2016 and 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Their names were Nimisha alias Fathima Isa, Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha, Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam, and Reffeala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The NIA's 2016 list of 20 most wanted Indians in ISIS included these four, plus Ajmala and Shamasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   Three of these six women were already Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   Two converted from Christianity to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   One converted from Hinduism to Islam (Nimisha Nair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Nimisha's husband, Eeza, had converted to Islam from Christianity (his old name was Bexon Vincent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Both Eeza and his brother, Bestin, who also converted and married one of the four women, were brainwashed converts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

The Indian government recently denied these four women permission to return to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Video interviews from 2020 on StratNews Global show Nimisha, Sonia Sebastian, and Reffeala, demonstrating their continued radicalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### The "32,000" Lie
While the film claimed 32,000 women were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, real-life incidents that loosely fit the film's premise involved only three women who converted from other religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The director initially evaded questions about the 32,000 number, calling it "arbitrary" at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, and later changed the film's description to "3" when the matter reached court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

The exaggeration from 3 to 32,000 is considered a "Big Lie" designed to convince people that even if the number is not exact, a large-scale conspiracy must exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. If only 3 women suffered, it indicates individual cases, not a conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Such exaggeration is seen as an attempt to defame an entire state based on a few individual incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

## Scope of ISIS Radicalization in India

While radicalization and recruitment by ISIS is a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, enabled by new communication modes like the dark web and encrypted platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, its scale in India is significantly smaller than portrayed in the film.

### Global vs. Indian Numbers
*   **Global**: The UN Undersecretary General of the United Nations Office of Counter Terrorism, Vladimir Voronkov, stated that nearly 40,000 foreign terrorist fighters from 110 countries went to Syria and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. A 2018 study by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization estimated 41,490 people from 80 countries were affiliated with ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **India**:
    *   By September 2020, the US Bureau of Counter-Terrorism reported that NIA had investigated 34 cases related to terrorism and arrested 160 people connected to ISIS in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   An October 2019 Observer Research Foundation (ORF) paper stated 180-200 pro-ISIS cases in India between 2014-2018, which included propaganda spreaders, not just those who left India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
    *   In 2019, the Indian Home Ministry reported 155 such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
    *   Out of 180-200 total cases, about 40 were from Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
    *   The US Department of State reported around 66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS as of November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, a figure close to Strat News Global's 2018 estimate of 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   Out of these 60, approximately 13 were women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, with only 6 women from Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### International Comparison
Compared to other countries, India has a strikingly low number of ISIS recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   Former Soviet republics: 7,000 recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   Russia: 2,500 recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   France: 1,700 recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   Germany: 760 recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   UK: Around 700 recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

These countries have significantly smaller populations than India, yet higher numbers of ISIS victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. India, with the world's third-largest Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, has a much lower ratio of ISIS recruits: 0.5 per million people, compared to 18 per million in France, 40 per million in Belgium, and 315 per million in Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Reasons for Low ISIS Recruitment in India

Experts and academics often question why so few Indian Muslims join ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Several factors contribute to this:

*   **Indian Agencies' Response**: Indian agencies like the NIA and IB conducted "Operation Pigeon," identifying 350 vulnerable Malayali youth and implementing de-radicalization programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **India's Syncretic Culture**: Former diplomat Talmiz Ahmad attributes this to India's [[impact_of_communal_tensions_on_indian_independence_process | syncretic culture]] and "Unity in Diversity," where Muslims live harmoniously with Hindus and Christians, leading them to reject extreme ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. ISIS itself reportedly considered Indian recruits inferior, believing Islam practiced in India was a "soft" or "liberal" version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   **Role of Muslim Clerics**: Many Muslim clerics have played a positive role. Darul Uloom Deoband issued a fatwa in March 2009, declaring India as "Dar al-Aman" (a country where militant Jihad is prohibited) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. In 2015, 70,000 Indian Muslim scholars issued a joint fatwa against ISIS, Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## Political Exploitation and Propaganda

Films like *The Kerala Story* are promoted by politicians, despite containing falsehoods, to serve [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | political agendas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### The "Love Jihad" Conspiracy Theory
*The Kerala Story* promotes the "Love Jihad" narrative, claiming forced religious conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **NIA Findings**: In 2017, the Kerala government submitted 90 cases to the NIA to investigate "Love Jihad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The NIA examined 11 cases and concluded in 2018 that while PFI facilitated conversions, not a single case involved forced conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   **Union Home Ministry Statement**: In 2020, Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy informed the Lok Sabha that no case of "Love Jihad" had been reported by any central agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

The "Love Jihad" theory is a "Big Lie" repeatedly propagated through political speeches, social media forwards (WhatsApp University), and propaganda news channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. This concept not only defames Muslims but also demonstrates a misogynistic view that women are easily manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### Broader Context of Religious Conversions
In India, religious conversions occur in various directions. A 2021 report showed that out of 506 people who registered for religious change with the Kerala government, 47% converted from Christianity or Islam to Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. A 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that 0.7% of people left Hinduism for other religions, while 0.8% left other religions to adopt Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Some religious leaders, like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, have also claimed to convert large numbers of people back to Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

This indicates a balanced flow of conversions, contrasting with the one-sided narrative of forced conversions. Politicians exploit these issues to [[religious_and_castebased_tensions_in_india | provoke conflict]] among Hindus, Muslims, and Christians for political gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

## Conclusion

The low numbers of ISIS recruits from India, particularly from Kerala, should be a source of national pride, demonstrating the resilience of India's [[impact_of_communal_tensions_on_indian_independence_process | unity in diversity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Kerala excels in human development indicators such as education and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. However, [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | political figures]] continue to use fabricated stories and propaganda films to malign states and sow hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

Such propaganda, reminiscent of films made during Hitler's rule to distort history and defame groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, aims to divide the country from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. Despite these efforts, India has historically overcome attempts to divide it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. For an authentic portrayal of ISIS recruitment, the Swedish TV series *The Caliphate* on Netflix is recommended, as it tells a true story without defamation or propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

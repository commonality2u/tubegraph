Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first Prime Minister, is widely regarded as the architect of the nation's miraculous transformation from a struggling, newly independent country to a highly developed, high-income nation. In 1965, Singapore was plagued by widespread poverty, unemployment, high crime rates, drug problems, frequent riots, overpopulation, and illiteracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Within 25 years, it became one of the top 5 richest and cleanest countries in the world, with virtually no corruption or crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## From Merger to Independence

Initially, Lee Kuan Yew believed that Singapore could not survive as an independent country and should merge with Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This merger occurred in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. However, the Malaysian government was not enthusiastic about the merger, especially after Lee Kuan Yew's People's Action Party (PAP) contested the 1964 Malaysian elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Singaporeans were also unhappy with the arrangement, particularly the agreement to pay 40% of Singapore's revenue to Malaysia's Central Government despite making up only 17% of the combined population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Furthermore, the special rights and privileges granted to Malays under Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution were disliked by non-Malay ethnicities in Singapore, who feared Malaysia was becoming a "Malay Malaysia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. These differences led to increased communal tensions and racial riots in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Consequently, in 1965, Singapore was separated from Malaysia and became the independent Republic of Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Shortly after, in 1967, the British announced their complete withdrawal of troops from Singapore, which posed a significant challenge as British forces provided many jobs and Singapore had no army of its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Lee Kuan Yew successfully requested the British to postpone their departure until 1971, giving him four years to stabilize the struggling nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Policies for Nation-Building

Lee Kuan Yew's leadership initiated a series of transformative policies:

### Ensuring Geopolitical Stability and Defense
*   **ASEAN Formation**: In 1967, Lee Kuan Yew founded the ASEAN group with foreign ministers from five countries to foster collaboration, cooperation, peace, and stability in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **National Service**: To address the lack of defense forces, compulsory National Service was introduced in the same year, requiring all 18-year-old boys to join the Army, Defence Forces, or National Service for a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Prioritizing Education and Skills
Lee Kuan Yew understood that high-quality education was crucial for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Compulsory and Affordable Education**: Singapore implemented compulsory primary education and provided high-quality public education through excellent government-run schools and colleges at nominal, almost free, fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Vocational Training**: Emphasis was placed on vocational training to equip citizens with practical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Skills Development Fund**: Employers were mandated to pay a monthly Skills Development Levy to support workforce upgrading programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This focus on skills enabled Singapore to become part of global supply chains for sophisticated technologies like biotech engineering, aerospace, and semiconductors by the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
These initiatives fall under [[singapores_education_and_vocational_training_systems | Singapore's education and vocational training systems]].

### Fostering Ethnic Harmony and Integration
Recognizing Singapore's diverse population, Lee Kuan Yew aimed for a multi-racial nation where every citizen was equal, not defined by religion, language, or culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP)**: To prevent self-segregation and ensure harmonious living, an Ethnic Integration Policy was introduced for government housing, mandating a fixed ratio of ethnicities in each building reflecting the national demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act**: Passed in 1990, this act established a Presidential Council for Religious Harmony, with two-thirds of its members representing major religions, tasked with ensuring inter-religious interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **Racial Harmony Day**: Celebrated annually on July 21st, school children dress in traditional costumes of other religions and read the Declaration of Religious Harmony, fostering principles of secularism, diversity, and unity from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
These efforts are central to [[singapores_ethnic_diversity_and_integration_policies | Singapore's ethnic diversity and integration policies]].

### Driving Cleanliness and Environmental Initiatives
Lee Kuan Yew considered cleanliness the hallmark of civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **"Keep Singapore Clean Campaign"**: Launched in 1968, this sustained campaign included licensing public waste collectors, providing blue recycling bins, creating numerous public toilets, and running programs like the Happy Toilet Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Strict Regulations**: Chewing gum was banned in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, and heavy fines were levied for spitting, littering, and smoking (S$1,000 for the first offense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   **Green Initiatives**: The "Tree Planting Day" initiative launched in 1972 successfully increased the number of trees planted to match the population within 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Rivers were cleaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, and extensive urban greenery became a tourist attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.
These measures significantly contributed to [[singapores_cleanliness_and_environmental_initiatives | Singapore's cleanliness and environmental initiatives]].

### Improving Housing and Urban Planning
*   **Slum Relocation and Public Housing**: Over 26,000 families were relocated from slums to high-rise public housing with essential services like water, electricity, and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. By 2021, 80% of Singaporeans lived in government-provided public housing, leading to minimal homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **Organized Informal Economy**: Hawker stalls were relocated to food centers, and new wholesale markets were developed for vegetable sellers to improve cleanliness and urban aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
*   **Industrial Relocation**: More than 2,800 industries were relocated to enhance urban planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

### Catalyzing Economic Development
To overcome the lack of natural resources and jumpstart the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>, Lee Kuan Yew pursued a dual strategy:
*   **Government Spending on Infrastructure**: Significant government investment went into large infrastructure projects, including a world-class port and one of the best airports globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. The Housing Development Board (HDB) and Economic Development Board (EDB) were created, generating substantial employment and forming the economy's backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. This reflects the [[role_of_government_in_job_creation | role of government in job creation]].
*   **Open Economy and Foreign Investment**: Recognizing Singapore's location as its only advantage, the economy was opened up to attract foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. This involved reducing tax rates (2-24% income tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>, eliminating red tape, developing a single trade window, and inviting international businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. Consequently, Singapore ranks second globally for ease of doing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
These strategies were fundamental to the [[economic_development_of_singapore | economic development of Singapore]].

### Combating Corruption
Eliminating corruption was a major precondition for attracting foreign investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. Singapore is now the 4th least corrupt country in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **High Salaries for Public Officials**: Salaries of government employees, politicians, and ministers were significantly raised, with the current Prime Minister being the highest-paid globally, earning $1.61 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. The logic was that good income would discourage corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Performance-Related Pay**: Salaries also included a performance-related component to reward good performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Severe Punishments**: Corrupt officials face heavy fines (up to $100,000) and imprisonment (up to 5 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
*   **Independent Anti-Corruption Agency**: The Prevention of Corruption Act was passed in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>, and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau was granted more powers and operational autonomy, making it independent of political interference, even from the Prime Minister's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

### Promoting Public Transportation and Fiscal Prudence
*   **Discouraging Car Ownership**: To conserve precious land in the densely populated island, high taxes were placed on motor vehicles, and a limited number of cars are allowed on the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Affordable Public Transport**: Buses and the metro system were made highly affordable, clean, and safe, encouraging public transport use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Government-Owned Enterprises**: Singapore's government owns numerous successful companies, such as Temasek Holdings, operating in various sectors, which generate substantial profits that benefit citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Discipline**: Singapore's government operates with a fiscal surplus in most years, earning more than it spends, and adheres to strict fiscal discipline rules enshrined in its constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.
*   **Central Provident Fund**: A compulsory Central Provident Fund encourages high savings rates among citizens, with Singapore having one of the highest gross domestic savings rates globally (57.5% of GDP in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

## Lee Kuan Yew's Leadership Philosophy
Lee Kuan Yew deliberately avoided developing a personality cult around himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. There are no busts, statues, monuments, or temples to honor him in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>, reflecting his focus on national development rather than personal image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. He was an educated, pragmatic leader, open to suggestions, and not strongly bound by any single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.

While some categorize him as a "benevolent dictator" due to his stance against extensive free speech and limited press freedom during his tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>, Singapore is considered an exceptional case because Lee Kuan Yew reportedly held himself accountable and listened to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The key lesson from Singapore's success under Lee Kuan Yew's leadership lies in the precise policies he implemented to achieve national development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

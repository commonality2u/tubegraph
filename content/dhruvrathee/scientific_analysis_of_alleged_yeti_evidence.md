The mystery of the Yeti, often referred to as the "Abominable Snowman," has captivated imaginations for centuries, prompting numerous [[expeditions_and_investigations_into_yeti_sightings | expeditions and investigations]] into its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. While [[historical_and_cultural_accounts_of_the_yeti | stories about Yeti]] are thousands of years old, some dating back to the pre-Buddhist era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, modern scientific inquiry has sought to differentiate [[myth_versus_reality_in_yeti_legends | myth from reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Early Investigations and Physical Evidence

Early claims of Yeti sightings and discoveries often sparked interest and led to attempts at scientific verification.

### Pangboche Monastery Relics
Locals in Nepal claimed that the Pangboche Monastery held a Yeti's skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In 1953, an expedition sent by the British newspaper *Daily Mail* visited the monastery and took a hair sample from the alleged Yeti's skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. Analysis of this sample concluded it belonged to neither a human nor an animal, nor was it actually hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

### Tom Slick's Expeditions
American oilman and millionaire Tom Slick undertook multiple [[expeditions_and_investigations_into_yeti_sightings | expeditions]] to search for Yeti in East Nepal's valleys between 1957 and 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. His first expedition found three Yeti footprints and hair strands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. In his second expedition, he used bloodhounds trained on mountain lions and bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. He also studied two skulls and mummified hands from four monasteries, believed to be Yeti remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. After his research, Slick theorized there might be three types of Yetis: one supernatural and two real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. He died in an airplane crash before presenting his full findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

### The "Yeti Finger"
Irish American explorer Peter Byrne obtained a finger from the alleged "Yeti's hand" at Pangboche Monastery, bribing the Lamas with a donation after they initially refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. He smuggled it to London with the help of actor James Stewart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>. Professor William Osman Hill analyzed the finger, concluding it was human, not a Yeti's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

## Analysis of Footprints

Footprints have been a common source of alleged Yeti evidence, prompting detailed examination.

### Eric Shipton's 1951 Photograph
The most famous Yeti story involves British mountaineer Eric Shipton, who, along with surgeon Michael Ward, photographed footprints at Menlung Glacier in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. These prints were 13 inches long and 8 inches wide, larger than human feet but similar in appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Shipton's photos, published globally, were seen as strong evidence for Yeti's existence and triggered a widespread search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Daniel C. Taylor's Explanations
American author Daniel C. Taylor, who spent years searching for Yeti, particularly in Nepal's Barun Valley, focused on analyzing footprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. He found that alleged Yeti footprints often belonged to bears, specifically a species known as Rukh Bhaalu or Tree Bear in Nepali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.

Taylor explained that these bears, when walking, often place their hind legs on the footprints of their front legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. This gait can make it appear as if a creature walked on two legs instead of four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>. He noted that while front paw prints show nail marks, the hind legs stepping on them can erase these marks due to pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>. Partial overlaps of front and hind prints can also make the combined footprint appear much larger, up to 12 inches long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.

Taylor also observed that bear cubs, when climbing trees, squeeze their paws, leaving a thumb-like mark in snow that resembles a human footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. He asserted that a "second photo" of Eric Shipton's findings, clearly showing bear footprints, did not go viral, unlike the more ambiguous first photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>.

## Modern DNA Studies

Recent scientific research has utilized DNA analysis to examine alleged Yeti samples.

### Oxford University Study (2014)
In 2014, geneticist Bryan Sykes at Oxford University tested the DNA of over 30 hair samples from various Himalayan regions, all claimed to be from Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>. Most samples were identified as belonging to known animals like horses or bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>. Two samples initially did not match any known species, suggesting a potentially undiscovered animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>. However, re-evaluation by other scientists found that these two samples were from a known rare sub-species of the Himalayan brown bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.

### New York University Study (2017)
A 2017 study at a New York university analyzed over nine alleged Yeti samples, including hair, bones, and teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>. The study concluded that eight of the samples were from Asian black bears, Himalayan brown bears, or Tibetan brown bears, and one sample was from a dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>.

## Re-evaluation of Eyewitness Accounts and Alleged Incidents

Over time, prominent explorers and researchers have changed their views on the Yeti, often concluding that it is a misidentification of known animals.

### Reinhold Messner's Conclusion
Legendary Italian climber Reinhold Messner initially denied Yeti's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. However, an encounter in 1986, where he saw a large, dark, bipedal creature, changed his belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. He then spent 12 years searching for Yeti, but ultimately concluded that there are no human-like abominable snowmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>. He stated that the Yeti is nothing but a Himalayan brown bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.

### Ernst Schafer's Finding
In 1939, zoologist Ernst Schafer, on a secret mission to Tibet sponsored by the Nazi Party, concluded that Yeti does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>. He shot a beast the locals identified as a Yeti, which he determined to be a Tibetan bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>.

### Edmund Hillary's View
Edmund Hillary, the first person to climb Mount Everest, also spent months looking for Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>. He concluded that Yeti does not exist and is merely a myth born from people's superstitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>.

### Arunachal Pradesh Murder Incident (2008)
A local story from 2008 in Arunachal Pradesh described a worker found dead with a broken neck, with no signs of robbery or animal attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Locals claimed police found a hair strand that belonged to neither human nor animal, and a Yeti footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. They believed a Yeti killed the worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

However, a BBC Radio investigation by Andrew Benfield and Richard Horsey found that the police FIR did not mention Yeti or its footprints, stating the cause of death was unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. The doctor who examined the alleged hair sample clarified it was not hair at all, but rather from a plant or leaf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>. This incident is now believed to have fueled local rumors and speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>.

## Alternative Scientific Explanations

The scientific consensus largely attributes Yeti sightings to misidentification of known animals, particularly bears.

### Himalayan Bears
Various species of bears, including the Himalayan brown bear, Asian black bear, and Tibetan brown bear, are commonly cited as the real-world animals behind Yeti sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. Their bipedal locomotion, size, and fur color variations match descriptions of Yeti.

### Gigantopithecus: A Prehistoric Connection
A compelling [[comparisons_between_yeti_myths_and_real_animal_discoveries | comparison]] can be made with *Gigantopithecus*, a 10-foot-tall ape that lived from 2 million to 200,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>. Weighing 200-300 kg and covered in thick fur, it fits the physical description of a Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>. Its fossils have been found near the Himalayan mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>. It is hypothesized that early humans may have encountered *Gigantopithecus*, and stories about this animal were passed down through generations, eventually evolving into the Yeti folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite generations of folklore and numerous alleged sightings and pieces of evidence, scientific analysis has consistently failed to provide verifiable proof of the Yeti's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Modern DNA studies have identified all analyzed "Yeti" samples as belonging to known bear species or other common animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>. Expert consensus points to misidentification of animals, particularly various types of Himalayan bears, as the source of most Yeti sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. The absence of clear photographic or video evidence in the age of smartphones further diminishes the claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:00]</a>. The Yeti largely remains a cultural phenomenon and a testament to human fascination with the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>.

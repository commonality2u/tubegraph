## Impact of Kalpana Chawla on Science Education in India

[[kalpana_chawlas_life_and_achievements | Kalpana Chawla]], a 40-year-old Indian-born American astronaut, became an inspiration for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Born in Karnal, Haryana, in 1962, she faced societal struggles from childhood, particularly as a girl in a region where male children were often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Despite initial disapproval from her father and teachers regarding her career choice in aeronautical engineering, she remained determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Passion for Science Education

[[kalpana_chawlas_life_and_achievements | Kalpana Chawla]] was deeply passionate about science education, specifically advocating for every girl in India to receive such an [[educational_infrastructure_and_opportunities | education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Her commitment stemmed from her own experiences, as she recalled not knowing if her family would even allow her to attend engineering college in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Promoting STEM through NASA Programs

To realize her vision, [[kalpana_chawlas_life_and_achievements | Kalpana Chawla]] convinced NASA to allow students from her secondary school in Karnal, Tagore Bal Niketan Senior Secondary School, to participate in NASA's Summer Space Experience Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Starting in 1998, this initiative ensured that two girls from the school were sent annually to Houston, America, to attend the Foundation for International Space Education's United Space School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

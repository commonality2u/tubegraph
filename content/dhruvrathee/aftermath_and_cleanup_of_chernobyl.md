The [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster overview | Chernobyl disaster]], occurring on April 26, 1986, at 1:23 AM, involved the explosion of Reactor Number 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The nuclear reaction within the reactor became completely out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. An emergency shutdown button was pressed, but a design flaw caused a massive blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This explosion engulfed the reactor in flames, releasing harmful radioactive material into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath

The amount of harmful radioactive material released was equivalent to 400 [[the_impact_of_atomic_bombings_on_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | Hiroshima atomic bombs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The disaster is still considered the "World's Worst Nuclear Disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The radiation spread not only across Ukraine but also throughout Europe, from Spain to Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, causing radioactive rain in the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Firefighting Efforts

The fire alarm began ringing at 01:26 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Firefighters, initially unaware of the nuclear nature of the fire, attempted to extinguish it with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. This graphite-fueled fire took more than 10 days to put out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Helicopters dropped thousands of tonnes of clay, sand, boron, and lead from the sky to reduce radiation spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. One helicopter crashed during this dangerous task, killing four people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Radiation Sickness and Casualties

Two people were instantly killed in the initial blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Firefighters experienced symptoms of radiation sickness, such as fatigue and nausea, shortly after returning home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Approximately 28 of these firefighters died within a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Those exposed to less radiation died within a couple of years, while others developed diseases like cancer within 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

### Preventing a Third Blast: The Heroes of Chernobyl

Even after the fire was extinguished, the reactor continued to produce high levels of heat, causing cracks in its base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. A major concern was the radioactive water tank located beneath the reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. If the superheated reactor came into contact with this water, it would instantly turn into steam, leading to a massive explosion, potentially larger than the previous two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This third blast could have killed millions and rendered much of Europe uninhabitable for 500,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

To prevent this catastrophe, three volunteer heroes – Alexei Ananenko, Boris Baranov, and Valeri Bezpalov – undertook the perilous task of diving into the radioactive water tank to drain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. On May 4, 1986, wearing simple diving equipment, they swam in the dark to locate and open the crucial valves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. All three divers survived the immediate mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Boris passed away in 2005 from a heart attack, while Alexei and Valeri are still alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Cleanup Efforts

Once the immediate threat of a third explosion was averted, the extensive cleanup of radioactive waste began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Initially, Soviet Union officers attempted to use remote-controlled robots, but these failed due to the high radiation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

Thousands of people, known as "liquidators," were then sent in to clean up the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. From 1986 to 1987, 200,000 liquidators actively decontaminated the zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

## Government Response and Secrecy

During the Cold War, the Soviet government attempted to cover up the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. However, the spread of radioactive dust, reaching as far as Sweden, forced their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Swedish monitoring stations detected unreasonably high radioactivity levels and estimated the source through wind direction analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

On April 28, 1986, two days after the disaster, the Soviet Union publicly admitted that an accident had occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The delayed notification to the local population around the power plant is a major point of blame for the Soviet government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

## Exclusion Zone and Containment

By May 2, 1986, a 30 km radius around the nuclear power plant was declared an exclusion zone, restricting entry to scientists and government officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

To contain the radioactive waste, a concrete and metal structure called the "Sarcophagus" was built over the damaged reactor, completed by November 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This temporary structure, however, was not designed for the long term and began showing rust and cracks after 28 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

In 2010, construction began on the "New Safe Confinement" (NSC), a more robust structure designed to cover the existing sarcophagus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. This new containment cost $3 billion and took 9 years to build, completing in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. It is expected to keep the reactor sealed for the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## Long-term [[Impact of the Chernobyl disaster | Impacts]]

### Health Impacts

In 2018, the United Nations Scientific Community reported 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer among children under 18 who lived through the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. This was mainly attributed to radioactive dust settling on pastures, which was then consumed by cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. The milk from these cows contained high levels of Iodine-131, which is absorbed by the thyroid gland, leading to thyroid cancer in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

### Environmental Impacts

The trees in the area surrounding the plant developed a reddish-ginger tint, leading to the designation "Red Forest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

The 30 km exclusion zone, largely abandoned by humans, has become a thriving habitat for wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Animals like wolves, deer, lynx, beavers, eagles, boars, and bears, including some endangered species, have established populations there due to the lack of human interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. While some animals show deformities from radiation exposure, its overall impact on animal populations has not been major <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

### Economic and Political Consequences

The disaster cost the Soviet Union an estimated $235 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. This included expenses for emergency response, cleanup, relocating people, survivor compensation, evacuations, and environmental decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Politically, the disaster is considered a significant factor in the eventual breakdown of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Safety

The [[Impact of the Chernobyl disaster | Chernobyl disaster]] spurred global research into preventing future nuclear accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. As a direct result, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) was founded in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. WANO's mission is to conduct safety checks on nuclear power plants worldwide and research ways to enhance their safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

One key improvement in present-day nuclear reactors is the use of water as both a moderator and a coolant to prevent positive feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, a critical design flaw in the RBMK reactor at Chernobyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## Continued Operations and Dismantling

Despite the high radiation levels, other parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant continued to operate until 2000 to meet Ukraine's power needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. The dismantling process of the power station is ongoing and is expected to conclude by 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

Currently, approximately 2,400 people work at the plant as guards, firefighters, scientists, technicians, and service staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Due to the high radiation levels, they work only two shifts per week and are regularly monitored for absorbed radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Before the recent war, tourist groups visited the exclusion zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

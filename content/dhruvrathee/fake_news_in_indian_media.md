In India, the proliferation of fake news has become a significant concern, with various sources and factors contributing to its spread. This issue impacts public discourse, political environments, and the overall understanding of factual information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Prevalence and Spread of Fake News
Fake messages are widely circulated through platforms like WhatsApp, often pertaining to religion, country, caste, planning, and history, leading many to believe them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. [[propaganda_and_misinformation_regarding_bjp | Political parties]] have become adept at creating fake news, which should ideally be exposed by mainstream media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Criticism of Mainstream Indian Media
There is a notable difference in news coverage between the current [[propaganda_and_misinformation_regarding_bjp | BJP government]] and previous Congress or Vajpayee governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The "empire of lies" has altered the perspectives of readers and viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Lack of Verification and Accountability
In India, media outlets often approve statements without verifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. During demonetization, some Hindi newspapers merely printed contradictory statements from political figures side-by-side, leaving it to the public to decide the truth, rather than fulfilling their responsibility to find and question the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Mainstream media has, to a large extent, "outsourced their duties and responsibility" to other individuals and platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Many major media outlets are associated with [[propaganda_and_misinformation_regarding_bjp | political parties]], which may hinder their ability to track the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Prioritizing Trivial News
Indian media is often criticized for not highlighting important facts and for focusing on vague or less significant news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. For instance, a news story about the Finance Bill legalizing corruption might be downplayed in favor of a vague statement by a political figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The fact that donation names remain undisclosed, presented as a sign of transparency, is also overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Declining Public Perception
Respect for Indian media has significantly declined since around 2007, when media personalities were highly regarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Foreign audiences, upon viewing clips of famous Indian journalists, often find them to be more akin to comedy or entertainment shows rather than serious journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Differences Between Indian and Foreign Media
There is a substantial [[differences_between_indian_and_foreign_media | difference between Indian and foreign media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. India ranks 138th out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, while developed nations are typically in the top 20-30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Foreign media tends to discuss facts calmly, avoiding unnecessary arguments and religious debates, unlike some Indian channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. In countries abroad, media is generally more aware and understands its responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

For example, the Washington Post in America meticulously tracks the promises made by President Trump, publishing articles on his false statements. In 649 days, Trump made 6420 false promises, averaging five lies a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Such a record-keeping practice is absent in India, partly due to the media's affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Combatting Fake News: The Role of Independent Voices
Given the mainstream media's shortcomings, individuals are increasingly taking personal risks to expose the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### [[Dhruv Rathee]]'s Efforts
YouTuber [[Dhruv Rathee]] started his channel in 2016 out of frustration with the widespread fake news and photoshopped images in Indian media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. He exposes fake news from Europe, similar to how Pratik Sinha and his team operate from Ahmedabad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. [[Dhruv Rathee]] views himself primarily as a YouTuber and an artist who creates videos related to journalism, rather than a qualified journalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. He conducts all his research and video editing himself, taking 22-24 hours per video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. He keeps his location confidential due to threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

[[Dhruv Rathee]] aims to educate people on various topics, including democracy, and encourages critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. His work has impacted people, changing their views, and he receives support from his followers and crowd donations, mostly from Indians and NRIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

## Challenges for Independent Journalists
Those who expose fake news face significant challenges:
*   **Lack of Support from Media** Mainstream media will not support individuals who speak against them; instead, they attempt to suppress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Censorship and Copyright Claims** Channels like "Peeing Human," which expose media hypocrisy, have faced copyright claims and attempts to forcefully shut down their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. This has led to individuals like [[Dhruv Rathee]] avoiding sharing news channel clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **Troll Army and Abuse** Those who raise their voice against misinformation often face abuse from "troll armies" in comments, which is seen as a form of censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Government Pressure** There have been instances where laws were passed to prevent criticism of the Prime Minister and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

## Social Media's Role in Polarization
Social media, while a powerful platform for sharing messages and educating people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, also contributes to polarization. Arguments on social media can create "bubbles," where users are continuously shown content aligned with their existing opinions, leading to a fragmented and polarized public sphere. While Indian media contributes to this division in India, social media plays a similar role abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Public Responsibility
Viewers now have the responsibility to examine both sides of a story and evaluate the facts presented, a task that was not expected of them previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. There is a need for the public and media to understand what topics truly require discussion, as many in India are more interested in historical events or scams from the past rather than current issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Individuals are encouraged to raise their voices and criticize the media for not fulfilling its role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

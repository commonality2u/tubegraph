The speaker's [[educational_infrastructure_and_opportunities | educational journey]] and interest in engineering were shaped by a combination of early influences, a practical approach to studies, and a willingness to explore various paths before committing to a career.

## Early Life and Influences

Born in Rohtak, Haryana, in October 1994, to a middle-class family, the speaker's mother was a teacher and his father an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His earliest memories include playing in Rohtak's lake and at his paternal grandparents' home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The family later moved to Delhi for better job opportunities for his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

A significant turning point occurred in 2003 when his father took a job in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. During a summer visit to Malaysia in 2003, the speaker experienced Lego for the first time, an experience that had a "large impact" on his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. It was also in Malaysia that the family bought their first digital camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### First Forays into Video Creation

At 8-9 years old, with a new webcam and a computer, the speaker made his first video in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. He learned about the concept of frame rates (24 photos making one second of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This knowledge allowed him to create "Claymation" by taking successive photos of clay characters, giving the illusion of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Developing Interests and Academic Approach

Around 2008, at 14-15 years old, the speaker developed a passion for reading books, particularly Satyajit Ray's detective series *Feluda* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This led him to initially aspire to be a criminal investigator or detective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, research revealed that modern detective work was not as depicted in novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Around the same time, he developed an interest in mechanical robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. His parents bought him a Lego block set that allowed him to create and program robots with touch and light sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. He would spend hours with this, even programming a robot to carry a digital camera and change direction upon hitting an obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The speaker describes himself as an "above-average student" with marks typically between 70% and 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. He believes that if any child is given such toys and enough time, they could build similar things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. He attributes his ability to focus to the absence of social media distractions at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

By 2010, his ambition shifted to becoming a host on National Geographic or Discovery Channel, admiring shows like Bear Grylls' *Man vs Wild* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. He notes the irony that he is now doing something similar on his vlog channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. His [[interest_in_politics_and_social_issues | interest in politics]] began in December 2011, influenced by the Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal protests against corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### The 80-20 Rule

The speaker adopted an "80-20 rule" philosophy for his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, believing one should study enough to get a "good enough score" (around 80%) rather than striving for perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. He reasoned that achieving the last 20% of marks required disproportionately more effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. His parents were content with him not being a topper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

## Higher Education and Career Path

After completing his 12th board exams with 85% in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, the speaker applied to various colleges, including Manipal University, IIT, and JEE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. However, his ranks were not high enough to secure admission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

His primary choice was to join the Indian Air Force or Army, leading him to sit for the NDA exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. His motivations included a desire for an adventurous, physically challenging career over a boring office job, and a family history of relatives in the Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. He passed the written test and was called for the SSB interview in Varanasi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Despite confidence in the physical test, he struggled in the group discussion, failing to assert his points due to his slow speaking style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

Following this, his parents looked at [[singapores_education_and_vocational_training_systems | colleges outside India]], believing it was a better option than a "C-grade engineering college in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. They chose Germany due to its almost free tuition fees compared to high costs in English-speaking countries like the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. His parents took out an education loan to cover living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

He received acceptance from Eindhoven University in the Netherlands and Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. He chose Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, a highly ranked university, and moved to Germany in August 2012 at 17 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. He attributes his admission, despite not being a topper, to less competition from foreign applicants in 2012 and foreign universities' focus on other skills, hobbies, and experiences, citing his interest in Lego robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

He chose Mechanical Engineering due to his childhood interest in robotics and technology, and because it was a common choice for friends and a field where one could later decide on a specific path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. He found it interesting and completed his Bachelor's in 2015, followed by a Master's in Renewable Engineering from the same university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. In 2018, he also earned another Bachelor's in Economics and Business Management purely out of interest to improve his video-making skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

After 2017-2018, he prioritized YouTube as his passion over traditional education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. He emphasizes that consistency and discipline come easily when one is passionate about something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. He applies the philosophy from *3 Idiots*: "Study not to be successful, but to be capable," focusing on excellence and continuous self-improvement rather than subscriber numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

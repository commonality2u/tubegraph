Japan's involvement in [[causes_of_world_war_ii | World War II]] stemmed from its imperialistic ambitions in Asia and the Pacific, coupled with escalating economic tensions with the United States. While initially attempting to remain neutral in the broader conflict, specific strategic decisions and attacks ultimately drew the United States into the war, solidifying Japan's role as a major Axis power.

## Imperial Expansion and "Greater Asia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[03:01]</a>

During the early 1900s, Japan exhibited a strong sense of imperialism, similar to European powers like Britain and France, actively annexing and colonizing other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10">[03:10]</a>. By 1940, the Japanese Empire included territories such as Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Eastern China, North Korea, South Korea, and Laos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24">[03:24]</a>.

Japanese colonizers promoted the idea of a "Greater Asia," claiming their goal was to unite Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>. However, in reality, this expansion served to exploit resources for Japan's sole benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48">[03:48]</a>. Japan's first significant expansion was the capture of the Manchuria region in Northern China in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56">[03:56]</a>. They also planned to expand into areas under Soviet Union control in Mongolia and southern regions like Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04">[04:04]</a>.

To capture French Indo-China (present-day Vietnam and Cambodia), Japan declared war on France in 1940 and seized these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>. This act directly made Japan a participant in [[causes_of_world_war_ii | World War II]], mirroring Hitler's territorial annexations in Europe with its own expansionist policies in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34">[04:34]</a>.

## Economic Sanctions and Escalation with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>

The United States, initially trying to avoid military involvement in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>, observed Japan's aggressive expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>. To deter Japan, the US implemented economic sanctions, stopping the export of essential materials like copper, iron, and steel to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55">[04:55]</a>. When this failed to curb Japan's ambitions, America ceased selling oil to Japan, a critical resource, as 80% of Japan's oil was imported from the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12">[05:12]</a>.

The US offered to resume oil sales on the condition that Japan withdraw from its occupied Chinese territories and break its alliance with Germany and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24">[05:24]</a>. Japan, however, rejected these demands, unwilling to abandon its "Greater Asia" dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36">[05:36]</a>.

## Search for Resources and Attack on Pearl Harbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44">[05:44]</a>

Facing an oil embargo, Japan sought alternative sources, identifying Malaysia (British Malaya) and Indonesia (Dutch East Indies) as rich in oil and other resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49">[05:49]</a>. Japan planned to capture these territories to secure its resource needs and end its dependency on the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54">[05:54]</a>.

However, attacking these British and Dutch colonies, who were allies of the US, carried the risk of American intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00">[06:00]</a>. Furthermore, Japan intended to seize the Philippines, which was American territory at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21">[06:21]</a>. Japan anticipated that the US would respond militarily if its own territory was attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31">[06:31]</a>.

Recognizing that a prolonged war against the stronger US military would result in defeat, Japan opted for a surprise attack on US military bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49">[06:49]</a>. The aim was to cripple American air and naval power, preventing the US from intervening while Japan secured its new territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53">[06:53]</a>.

On December 7, 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the US's Pearl Harbor Bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05">[07:05]</a>. Over 350 Japanese naval aircraft bombed the harbor, destroying 19 US Navy Ships and 188 military aircraft, and killing over 2,000 US military personnel within two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24">[07:24]</a>. Immediately after, Japan captured the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38">[07:38]</a>. This unprovoked attack led to the US officially declaring war on Japan, marking [[role_of_the_united_states_in_changing_wwii_dynamics | America's full involvement in World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08">[08:08]</a>. This, in turn, prompted Nazi Germany and Italy to declare war on the USA three days later, bringing the conflict into "full swing" by the end of 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24">[08:24]</a>.

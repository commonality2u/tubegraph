Despite his portrayal as a demon lord and villain in the [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ramayana]], Ravan is worshipped in certain parts of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This practice reflects a [[the_shift_in_perception_of_ravan_in_modern_times | shift in perception]] where some individuals and groups view Ravan with a "soft corner" and offer justifications for his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, even showing sympathy for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Reasons for Worship and Shifting Perceptions

The worship of Ravan stems from certain beliefs about his character and qualities, which contrast with the traditional narrative of "Hero Ram versus Villain Ravan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

*   **Scholarship and Devotion:** Many people acknowledge Ravan's positive aspects, such as his scholarship of the Vedas and holy scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, his mastery of playing the Veena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, and his devotion to Lord Shiva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. He was also considered a Brahmin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. These qualities lead some to believe he was not as "bad as we assumed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **"King of Our Tribe":** Some worshippers view Ravan as the "king of our tribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Unprecedented Scholar:** He is regarded as an "unprecedented scholar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a> and "the biggest pundit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Misunderstood Character:** Some believe Ravan was not inherently evil, stating, "People believe him to be wrong, but he wasn't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, and "Ravan didn't do anything evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Perception of Immortality:** There is a sentiment that "Ravan will be remembered forever. Ravan will be immortal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

This [[the_shift_in_perception_of_ravan_in_modern_times | shift in perception]] can be seen in popular culture, with poems on platforms like YouTube, viewed millions of times, expressing a preference for Ravan's character, such as "Let the world emulate Ram, I like being Ravan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

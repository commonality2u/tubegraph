In the realm of modern democracy, social media platforms have emerged as significant avenues for [[interest_in_politics_and_social_issues | political discourse]], activism, and raising public awareness. This shift has enabled individuals, including content creators, to mobilize public opinion and challenge established narratives.

## The Catalyst for Engagement

Initially, a content creator with a substantial YouTube following (10-12 million subscribers and 4-5 million views) expressed reluctance to delve into political topics due to potential backlash, mockery, discrediting videos, and even death threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The focus was primarily on educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

However, a pivotal incident in February, the Chandigarh election fraud—where a presiding officer was caught committing voter fraud on CCTV—served as a "trigger point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. The Supreme Court described this as a "murder of democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This event, alongside other concerns like biased media, overthrown elected governments, and horse-trading of MLAs, compelled the creator to speak out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

The first video, titled "Is India becoming a dictatorship?", garnered an unexpected 25 million views, indicating a deep resonance with the public's own concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Subsequent events, such as the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal and the freezing of Congress's bank accounts, further solidified the creator's resolve to continue raising awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Inspiration

The effort to spread awareness through social media faced significant hurdles, particularly given the perceived biases of traditional media, the "WhatsApp mafia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, and the pervasive nature of propaganda. Despite these challenges, the creator drew inspiration from the Bhagavad Gita's teaching to perform one's duty without obsession over results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, and from historical figures like Bhagat Singh and August Landmesser, who acted based on conviction regardless of personal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. This drive stemmed from a desire to speak up for the country's democracy and Constitution, honor the sacrifices of freedom fighters, and ensure accountability for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

## Impact and Reach of Social Media Activism

The impact of this social media activism was significant:
*   **Vast Reach** The YouTube channel, with 21 million subscribers, reached nearly 70 million unique viewers in 90 days, translating to approximately 7% of eligible voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Multi-Platform Engagement** Including other platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and [[the_influence_of_whatsapp_in_political_brainwashing | WhatsApp]], the estimated reach extended to 20-25% of voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.
*   **Authenticity** Statistics confirmed that over 80% of viewers were from India, refuting claims of bots or foreign viewership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. All engagement, including comments, likes, and views, was confirmed to be from real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **Grassroots Mobilization** Examples of [[public_outrage_and_social_medias_role_in_seeking_justice | public engagement]] included individuals forwarding videos to hundreds on WhatsApp, watching them in public spaces like cricket stadiums, and mentioning the content creator in ground interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. Children were seen exposing government claims, citing the videos as their source of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Influencing Voters** Celebrities were inspired to vote, and many overseas Indians returned to India specifically to cast their ballots after watching these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. People took projectors to villages to show videos to local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   **International Recognition** The activism received mentions in various international newspapers and media outlets, including France 24, The Economist, Al Jazeera, and Time Magazine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

## Facing Backlash and Defamation

The success of the activism led to intense backlash from opposing groups, including media, YouTubers, and IT cells, who launched a coordinated defamation campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. Tactics included:
*   **Personal Attacks** Calling the creator derogatory names like "dog," "cockroach," "bully," and "anti-national" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
*   **False Accusations** Spreading baseless claims of Chinese funding or being a Pakistani agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
*   **Sophisticated Disinformation** Using deepfake technology and fake audio clips to imitate the creator's voice and fabricate conversations about receiving money from politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. Opponents even admitted the creator's factual and constitutional correctness, thus planning to spread fake news against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   **Newspaper Involvement** Even reputable newspapers like Dainik Jagran were accused of spreading unverified false news, such as suspicions of funding from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

Despite these coordinated attacks, the overwhelming [[significance_of_social_media_in_promoting_communal_narratives | public support]] and love received by the creator overshadowed the defamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. The focus remained on highlighting real issues like unemployment, farmer concerns, and various scams, as opposed to engaging in personal attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

## The Collective "Mission 100 Crores"

The creator emphasized that this was not a solo mission but a collective effort, dubbed "#Mission100Crore," involving every Indian who cares for the country's improvement and a better future for its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. This movement was documented as an inspiration for others worldwide facing weakening democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>.

The commitment extends beyond election results, with an intention to continue raising a voice against government shortcomings, regardless of which party is in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>. The goal is to address persistent problems like unemployment, pollution, and the scarcity of honest politicians, holding governments accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

## The Broader Call to Action

The movement highlighted the crucial [[role_of_social_media_in_spreading_information | role of social media]] in political activism and called for broader [[social_responsibility_among_influencers | social responsibility]]. It emphasized the contributions of numerous women journalists (e.g., Poonam Agarwal, Manisha Pandey, Arfa Khanum Sherwani) and influencers (e.g., Dr. Medusa, Neha Singh Rathore) who used various forms of communication, including satire and song, to speak up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. This active participation empowers women by helping them reclaim their constitutional freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>.

The message extended to all citizens:
*   **Personal Transformation** Combatting communal, casteist, misogynist, and classist thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Support** Practicing "Vocals for Local" by supporting local farmers and artisans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.
*   **Environmental Responsibility** Reducing plastic use, avoiding littering, and planting trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>.
*   **Civic Duty** Voting in every election and advocating for free and fair election processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>.
*   **Professional Integrity** Encouraging individuals in every profession, from teachers to civil servants to filmmakers, to perform their duties honestly and diligently to contribute to the nation's happiness and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>.

The overarching vision is a world where every person can thrive, free from discrimination and injustice, a "heaven on earth" achieved through collective action and unwavering commitment to doing what is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.

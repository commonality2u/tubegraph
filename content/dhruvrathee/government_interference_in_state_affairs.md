Recent incidents in India suggest a trend towards a "One Nation, One Party" system, where the central government is accused of [[is_india_moving_towards_dictatorship | eroding the power of elected state governments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This includes taking away power from elected governments by making new laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, interfering in state governments' work through governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, and withholding funds from state governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Interference via Governors
Several states with opposition governments have repeatedly accused the Modi government of using governors to interfere in their day-to-day affairs and prevent them from working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. States making such accusations include West Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, Tamil Nadu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, and Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

In Kerala, the government accused its governor of delaying bills passed by the state government for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The state even complained to the Supreme Court, which stated that governors cannot delay bills unconstitutionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

### Delhi Government and LG Conflict
The conflict between the Lieutenant Governor (LG) and the Delhi government has been a long-standing issue, with CM Kejriwal repeatedly stating that his government is not allowed to work due to LG interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. The Delhi government approached the Supreme Court, which ruled in their favor, stating that the LG should not interfere and real power should rest with the elected government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

However, after the Supreme Court's decision, the Central Government introduced a new law, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2023 (GNCTD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. This act transferred many powers previously vested with the Delhi government to the LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

CM Kejriwal has highlighted specific impacts of this interference on public services:
*   Disruption of medicine flow in hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   Stoppage of tests in mobile clinics for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   Stopping payments to laboratories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   Removal of data entry operators in government hospitals, leading to difficulties in patient registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

These actions, according to critics, raise concerns about the government's priorities and whether they genuinely care about the welfare of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. If such actions continue, there are fears that the country could descend to the levels of countries like North Korea and Russia, where democracy exists only on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

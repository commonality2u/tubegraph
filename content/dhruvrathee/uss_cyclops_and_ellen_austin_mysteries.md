## The USS Cyclops Disappearance
In 1918, a significant and horrifying incident occurred involving the USS Cyclops, one of the largest and fastest ships of the US Navy at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The vessel was a crucial asset, especially during America's involvement in World War I, where it was used to transport troops and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

On March 4, 1918, the USS Cyclops departed from West Indies Baltimore, a city near Washington, embarking on a nine-day journey towards Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Aboard were 306 people, and the ship was carrying 11,000 tonnes of manganese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The weather was clear upon its departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The ship sent a message during its departure, which proved to be the last communication ever received from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. After this, the USS Cyclops suddenly disappeared, with no further news of its whereabouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This disappearance shocked everyone, given the size and importance of the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## The Ellen Austin Mystery: A Maritime Enigma
The mystery of the Ellen Austin, occurring in 1881, is considered even more daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The Ellen Austin was a 210-foot-long ship traveling from London to New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

While on its journey, near the [[theories_explaining_bermuda_triangle_disappearances | Bermuda Triangle]] area, the Ellen Austin encountered an unidentified ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This ship appeared normal from the outside, but upon closer inspection, there was no trace of any humans aboardâ€”no crew or people whatsoever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

The captain of the Ellen Austin decided to investigate. He waited for two days alongside the unidentified ship, looking for any sign of life or response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Receiving none, he boarded the ship and found that everything was in its proper place, with valuable items intact, suggesting it had not been subjected to a pirate attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Attempts to Salvage the Ghost Ship
Impressed by the intact cargo, the captain of the Ellen Austin decided to send some of his crew members to sail the newly found ship alongside his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. For the first two days, both ships proceeded normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. However, a storm erupted, separating their paths, and the unidentified ship vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

After the storm, the Ellen Austin's captain located the ship again using his spyglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Upon reaching it, he discovered once more that there was no trace of any humans, including the crew members he had transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The ship itself, however, remained intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

The story suggests that the captain made another attempt to bring the ship with him, sending more crew members to steer it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Yet again, after a few days, another storm occurred, and the same pattern repeated: the unidentified ship separated, and the new crew members aboard it disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Aftermath and Legacy
When the Ellen Austin returned, its owner was reportedly so terrified by the story that he sold the ship to a German company, which renamed it "Meta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Despite its intriguing nature, the Ellen Austin incident is largely considered an urban legend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Due to its age, proper verification is not possible, and it falls into the category of popular historical stories that cannot be conclusively proven true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Journalist Larry Kusche, author of 'The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved,' noted that many such stories associated with the [[theories_explaining_bermuda_triangle_disappearances | Bermuda Triangle]] were fabricated over time to enhance its mysterious reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The Ellen Austin story is cited as one such fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

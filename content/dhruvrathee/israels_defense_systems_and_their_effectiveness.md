Israel's sky has recently witnessed intense missile activity, necessitating the use of its advanced air defense systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Following missile attacks, notably from Iran, Israel has relied on its multi-layered defense architecture to intercept incoming threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Despite claims of minimal damage, the need for robust defense is evident, with craters outside significant sites like the Mossad's headquarters indicating successful hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Components of Israel's Air Defense

Israel employs a tiered defense system designed to counter various ranges and types of aerial threats:

### [[iron_dome_system_and_its_limitations | Iron Dome]]
The [[iron_dome_system_and_its_limitations | Iron Dome]] is Israel's most well-known defense system, primarily designed to intercept short-range rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Coverage**: It protects the sky up to 10 km, within a 70 km radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: It is a missile system that detects incoming rockets before they hit the ground and launches its own Tamir Missiles to counter them through interception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Cost**: One Tamir Missile costs $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### David's Sling
For medium to long-range missiles, Israel utilizes the David's Sling system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Coverage**: It can protect as high as 15 km within a 300 km radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Missiles launched by David's Sling cost $1 million per missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Arrow System (Arrow 3)
To intercept long-range ballistic missiles, such as those launched from Iran (which is 1,000 km away), the Arrow System (specifically Arrow 3) is employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Coverage**: Arrow 3 has the highest detection range in Israel, extending to 2,400 km and up to a 100 km altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Capability**: It can detect missiles launched from almost outer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. During an April attack, an Arrow 3 system successfully intercepted a ballistic missile outside Earth's atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Missiles launched by the Arrow System cost several millions of US dollars per missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Effectiveness and Limitations

While these systems appear robust, they face significant challenges:
*   **Cost**: Operating these defense systems is extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. During the April 2024 attack, Israel spent around $200 million in just one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Quantity**: Israel does not have an unlimited supply of interceptor missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. If too many ballistic missiles are launched, their defense systems could be overwhelmed due to sheer quantity and lack of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Allied Support**: In major attacks, Israel receives assistance from allied countries like America, the UK, and Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For example, during the April attack, America tackled approximately 80 drones and 6 ballistic missiles, and the British Royal Air Force's Typhoon fighter jets took down several drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. [[controversies_and_failures_of_israeli_intelligence | Israeli intelligence]] also plays a crucial role, as the 1,000 km distance between Iran and Israel allows for about 2 hours lead time for drones, making protection easier with solid intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Distinction Between Rockets and Missiles
It is important to differentiate between rockets and missiles, as Israel's defense systems are tailored to these differences:
*   **Rockets**: Smaller in size, launched from the ground in a projectile, and rely on rough estimates for targeting (e.g., rockets used by Hamas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Ballistic Missiles**: Can be as tall as a three-story building, equipped with precision targeting, and capable of leaving Earth's atmosphere before re-entering to hit a specific target (e.g., Fatah missiles from Iran) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Iran's 2023 Fatah missiles are hypersonic ballistic missiles, capable of speeds up to 18,000 km/h, or 15 times the speed of sound, reaching Israel in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

Despite the sophistication and apparent safety provided by these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, the high cost and finite supply of interceptors remain critical vulnerabilities for Israel's defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

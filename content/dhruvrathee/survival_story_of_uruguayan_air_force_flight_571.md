On October 12, 1972, a small chartered aircraft departed from Uruguay, South America, heading towards Santiago, the capital of Chile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The plane was carrying 45 passengers, including rugby players and some of their family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The flight was expected to last only three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. However, the route required crossing the immense [[Andes Mountains Plane Crash | Andes Mountains]], the world's longest mountain range, which can be particularly devastating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Journey and the Crash
On the day of departure, a storm in the mountains prevented the plane from continuing its flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Pilots decided to make an overnight stop in Mendoza, Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The next day, October 13, the plane took off again at 2:18 p.m., with pilots ensuring clear weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The flight was smooth for the first hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

At 3:21 p.m., as the plane began its descent near Santiago, it encountered severe turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Clouds enveloped the aircraft, making visibility impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Alarms blared, and warning lights flashed, but the rugby players, initially unfazed by the turbulence, joked around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. As the clouds cleared, a passenger saw the plane was perilously close to a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Upon realizing the danger, the pilots immediately tried to lift the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Despite putting in maximum power, it was too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The rear of the aircraft collided with the mountain, separating entirely, and two rows of seats flew out, carrying three passengers with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The plane then plummeted, losing its left wing in a second collision, causing more passengers to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The front portion of the plane crashed into a glacier, sliding 700 meters at 350 km/h before coming to a destructive halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The cockpit was crushed, killing the pilots immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The aircraft lay broken on an unknown mountain in the Andes at an altitude of 3,570 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Remarkably, 33 of the 45 people on board survived the initial crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. It was later determined that the plane was 80 km off its planned route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath and Initial Survival
Among the survivors were 19-year-old Roberto Canessa and 20-year-old Gustavo Zerbino, both medical students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. They immediately began tending to the injured, many of whom had severe wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Fernando Parrado, 23, was in a coma due to a skull fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Search Efforts and Growing Despair
Within an hour of the plane's disappearance, the Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service was notified and deployed four aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Despite searching from dusk till night, they found nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Officials concluded the aircraft must have crashed in a remote, inaccessible area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The plane's white color made it incredibly difficult to spot against the snow and ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

On the night of October 13, survivors clung to hope, believing they would be found the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, five injured passengers succumbed to the snowy conditions that night, reducing the number of survivors from 33 to 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. They used the plane's fuselage as shelter, sealing the rear with luggage, seats, and snow to retain warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

On October 14, eleven aircraft from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay joined the [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search operation]] within the correct search area, yet failed to locate the crash site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Survivors tried writing "SOS" on the plane's roof with lipstick but lacked enough to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. They then attempted to form a large cross in the snow with suitcases, but this also proved ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Three aircraft flew over them that day, but their screams and waves went unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

By October 15, the need for water became critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. A passenger named Fito Strauch devised a method to melt snow using a metal sheet as a solar collector, collecting water droplets in empty wine bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Seat cushions were used as snowshoes, and wool from seat covers provided insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

On October 16, three days after the crash, Fernando Parrado awoke from his coma, discovering his mother had died and his 19-year-old sister was severely injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Despite his best efforts, his sister succumbed to her injuries eight days after the crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

> This accident serves as a stark reminder of life's unpredictable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The video transitions to a self-promotion for a "Time Management course," highlighting the importance of living every moment, as tomorrow is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The course aims to double productivity and happiness, offering practical techniques used by the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. A 40% discount was offered for the first 400 people using the code LOST40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The course is in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Most passengers, from coastal areas, had never seen snow before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. They were now enduring -30Â° Celsius temperatures at high altitude with inadequate food and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Another challenge was snow blindness, caused by the sun's ultraviolet rays reflecting off the snow and ice, damaging their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. They had only three pairs of sunglasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

On October 21, eight days after the crash, [[search_operations_and_efforts_to_find_mh370 | search and rescue teams]] officially ceased operations, concluding there was little chance of finding survivors after so much time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. After 142 hours of searching, the operation was stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Meanwhile, survivors found a transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Roy Harley, a rugby player with electronics knowledge, improvised a long antenna, and the radio began working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Eleven days after the crash, they heard the devastating news that the search operation had been canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Hearts broken, some cried, while Fernando Parrado remained calm, already contemplating another plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Desperate Measures: Cannibalism
By the 11th day, food supplies were nearly exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. They had only meager rations: 8 chocolate bars, 1 tin of mussels, 3 small jars of jam, a jar of almonds, a box of peanuts, some dates, candies, dried plums, and a few bottles of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. They had rationed food, with Parrado eating just one chocolate-covered peanut over three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

At 3,800 meters, there were no trees, plants, or animals to hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. With food gone, some tried eating cotton and leather from seats, which only made them sicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Facing starvation, the survivors made a shocking decision: to eat the bodies of their deceased friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Roberto Canessa, who proposed the idea, was the first to try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Others initially refused but, two days later, with no other option, they too resorted to eating human meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Further Disasters: The Avalanche
On October 29, 16 days after the crash, their new food source was also depleting, and they had no plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. That night, a loud grumble heralded an avalanche that buried the broken plane, suffocating eight people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Only 19 survivors remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Trapped in a small space under the snow, Parrado used a metal pole to create a ventilation hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. After two days of arduous digging, they created a tunnel and reached the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. A snowstorm forced them back into their snow cave for three more days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

When the weather cleared, survivors realized no one was coming to save them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. They decided to make their own efforts to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Canessa, Parrado, and Vizintin, the strongest among them, were chosen to embark on an expedition for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. They were given more food and the warmest clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## The Expedition for Help
Their initial task was to estimate their location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Before the crash, the co-pilot had stated they passed Curico, leading them to believe walking a few kilometers west would lead them to Chilean countryside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This estimation was gravely wrong; the crash site was 89 km east, deep in the Andes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

After a few days of rest, on November 15, 33 days after the crash, the three set out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Traveling east, they found the plane's separated tail section, containing suitcases, chocolates, meat patties, rum, clothes, comic books, medicines, and crucially, the aircraft's two-way radio system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. They decided to try to activate the radio for an SOS call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. They found 24 kg batteries in the tail section, but they were too heavy to carry back to the main fuselage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. With the help of Roy Harley, they attempted to start the radio there, but the aircraft's 115V AC system was incompatible with the 24V DC battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. After several failed attempts, they realized their only option was to walk westward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

On December 11, 59 days after the crash, another avalanche struck, killing three more survivors, leaving only 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. To survive the -30Â° Celsius nights during their climb, 18-year-old Carlos Miguel Rodriguez, who remembered his mother's sewing lessons, stitched together pieces of clothing to make a large sleeping bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

On December 12, two months after the crash, Parrado, Canessa, and Vizintin began climbing the glacier without mountaineering gear, maps, compasses, or climbing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. They still believed Chile was just a few kilometers west, expecting to find help in 2-3 days, and packed a 3-day supply of meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Parrado wore multiple layers of clothing, including three pairs of jeans and four pairs of socks covered by plastic bags, to combat the extreme cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The thin air at high altitude also made breathing difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

The improvised sleeping bag proved vital at night, allowing them to huddle together for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. After three days of climbing, on the morning of the fourth day, they realized their initial estimation was terribly wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. With dwindling food, Vizintin decided to return to the crash site to conserve resources, sliding back on an aircraft seat in just an hourâa journey that took them three days to ascend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

Parrado and Canessa continued climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Three hours later, they reached the mountain peak, only to see endless snowy mountains in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Desperate, Parrado spotted two snow-free mountain peaks on the far western horizon and decided they must travel in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

They hiked for many more days, eventually reaching a valley with a flowing river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Following the river downstream, they continued their arduous trek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. After nine days of walking, on December 20, they finally saw signs of human presence: cows in fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Too exhausted to walk further, they then saw three men on horseback across the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. Parrado shouted, but the river's noise drowned him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. By chance, one man spotted them and shouted, "Tomorrow!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

## The Rescue
The next day, the man, a Chilean farmer named Sergio Catalan, returned with paper and pencils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. He tied them to a stone and threw them across the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. For the first time, Parrado could send a message to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. He wrote in Spanish that he was from a plane that crashed in the mountains, had walked for 10 days, and that his injured friends were at the crash site, in urgent need of help and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

Sergio Catalan recognized the vague news of a plane crash months ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Shocked to find survivors of a two-month-old crash, he threw them a piece of bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. For the next 10 hours, he rode west on horseback to the nearest city to inform the army command in Santiago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

Farmers brought Parrado and Canessa to Los Maitenes, where they finally rested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. It was discovered they had hiked 61 km on foot over the last 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Canessa had lost half his body weight, weighing only 44 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Their story quickly became international news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

The Chilean Air Force immediately dispatched three helicopters for rescue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Army officers interviewed Parrado, who had kept the pilot's flight chart and plotted their hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. With Parrado's guidance in a helicopter, the crash site and the remaining survivors were located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.

On December 22, 1972, 70 days after the crash, two search and rescue helicopters finally reached the survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

## The Miracle of the Andes
In total, 16 survivors were rescued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. They were suffering from altitude sickness, dehydration, broken bones, and malnutrition but eventually recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. This [[andes_mountains_plane_crash | survival story]], often referred to as the [[the_miracle_of_the_andes | Miracle of the Andes]], stands as a testament to hope, patience, and the indomitable human spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

Singapore, a nation known today for its "Unity in Diversity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, faced significant challenges regarding ethnic and racial harmony upon its independence. Historically, the island experienced violent clashes between its ethnic Chinese and Malay populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. After its separation from Malaysia in 1965, racial riots in 1964 highlighted the deep communal tensions within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Diverse Demographics
Today, Singapore is a highly diverse nation where people of various religions and ethnicities live harmoniously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Religious Diversity
The country is home to people from five major religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, along with smaller populations of Jewish, Zoroastrian, Jain, and Sikh communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Atheists constitute the second-largest group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Ethnic Composition
Ethnically, Singapore is also very diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:
*   **Chinese:** The largest majority, making up 74.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Malays:** 13.5% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Indians:** Comprising 9%, with Tamils, Bengalis, and Punjabis as the largest Indian communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Others:** Eurasians and Arabs make up the remaining 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Orang Laut:** The original tribal inhabitants have lived in Singapore for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Integration Policies Under [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]]
Prime Minister [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] envisioned Singapore as a multi-racial nation and a secular state where every citizen is equal, not defined by religion, language, or culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. He actively pursued policies to foster assimilation and prevent segregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP)
To combat self-segregation into ethnic enclaves, [[role_of_lee_kuan_yew_in_singapores_development | Lee Kuan Yew]] introduced the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. This policy mandates fixed ethnic ratios in government housing, ensuring that the ethnic makeup of each building reflects the national demographic percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This encourages Chinese, Malay, and Indian citizens to live as neighbours and interact harmoniously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act
In 1990, the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act was passed, establishing a Presidential Council for Religious Harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Two-thirds of its members are representatives of major religions, tasked with ensuring inter-religious interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

### Racial Harmony Day
Singapore also celebrates a "Racial Harmony Day" annually on July 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. On this day, schoolchildren dress in traditional costumes of other religions and read the Declaration of Religious Harmony, instilling principles of secularism, diversity, and unity from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

These proactive measures, particularly the Ethnic Integration Policy, were designed to prevent communal brainwashing and foster social cohesion by ensuring different ethnicities live together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

On August 6, 1945, at 8:15 AM, the city of Hiroshima, Japan, experienced a sudden and devastating event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. An American Boeing B-29 aircraft dropped an object, which, after 43 seconds of freefall, detonated, creating an instant fireball and temperatures reaching 4,000Â°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. In a blink of an eye, 80,000 people were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This event marked the beginning of a new age, recalling Robert Oppenheimer's quote from Hindu scripture: "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Context: World War II and Japan's Role

The events leading to the atomic bombings are rooted in World War II, which began in 1939 with Hitler's invasion of Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The war was fought primarily between the Axis Powers (Nazi Germany, Italy, Japan) and the Allied Powers (Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Initially, America sought to remain neutral following the devastating results of World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, this changed in 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, forcing the US to join the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### [[reasons_for_japans_involvement_in_world_war_ii | Japan's Imperial Ambitions]]

During the early 1900s, Japan pursued an imperialistic agenda, similar to European powers, colonizing territories to exploit resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. By 1940, the Japanese Empire included Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Eastern China, North Korea, South Korea, and Laos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Japan's first major expansion was the capture of Manchuria in Northern China in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. They aimed to expand further into Soviet Union territories in Mongolia and French Indo-China (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. When Japan declared war on France and captured these areas in 1940, it officially became a participant in WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### US Economic Pressure and Pearl Harbor

The US, though wanting to avoid military intervention, attempted to deter Japan's expansion through economic sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. They stopped exporting essential materials like copper, iron, and steel to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Later, the US ceased oil sales, a crucial resource for Japan (80% of its oil was imported from the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. America demanded Japan withdraw from occupied Chinese areas and break its alliance with Germany and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Japan, unwilling to abandon its "Greater Asia" dream, sought alternative oil sources in Malaysia and Indonesia, which were British and Dutch territories, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. To avoid US interference when attacking these Allied territories and the American-colonized Philippines, Japan decided to launch a surprise attack to cripple the US military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, destroying 19 US Navy Ships, 188 military aircraft, and killing over 2,000 US military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Within hours, Japan captured the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This attack officially brought America into WWII, followed by Britain and China declaring war on Japan, and Nazi Germany and Italy declaring war on the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Japan's Unwillingness to Surrender

By April 1945, Italy had surrendered, and Hitler's suicide led to Germany's surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. However, Japan, despite continual losses, refused to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### [[reasons_for_japans_involvement_in_world_war_ii | Japanese Fascism and Brainwashing]]

The common people in Japan were heavily brainwashed, believing Emperor Hirohito to be a divine figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Opposition to the war was suppressed, with those against it being hunted down and executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Japanese cultural traditions, like the Bushido Samurai tradition, were manipulated to promote dying for the Emperor as the greatest honor and surrendering as humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:10:09]</a>.

This pervasive brainwashing led to extreme tactics, such as the Kamikaze pilots, who deliberately crashed their fighter jets into enemy warships in suicide bombings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Children were even trained to carry explosives and sacrifice themselves to destroy tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Despite widespread starvation and unemployment, the citizens did not revolt against the Emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb

The Allied powers realized that a full-scale invasion of Japan, codenamed Operation Downfall, would be incredibly costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The Battle of Okinawa (April 1 - June 22, 1945), where American forces encountered fierce resistance, shocked the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The battle, known as the bloodiest in the Pacific, resulted in 12,000 American soldiers killed, over 50,000 injured, 110,000 Japanese soldiers killed, and over 100,000 Okinawan civilians killed (one-fourth of the island's population) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This grim preview led military heads to believe an invasion would be too costly in lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

On April 12, 1945, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed away, and Vice President Harry Truman assumed the presidency, inheriting the responsibility of ending the war with Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

Around this time, Truman learned about [[the_development_and_testing_of_nuclear_weapons_during_world_war_ii | The Manhattan Project]], a top-secret US military project developing the first atom bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The first successful test of an atom bomb occurred on July 16, 1945, in New Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

On July 26, 1945, the US, China, and Great Britain issued the Potsdam Declaration, demanding Japan's unconditional surrender and warning of "prompt and utter destruction" if they refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Japan, unaware of the existence of atomic weapons, rejected the declaration on July 29, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Following this rejection, President Truman authorized the use of the atomic bomb on Japan on August 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

## The Bombings

### [[the_impact_of_atomic_bombings_on_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | Hiroshima (August 6, 1945)]]

The "Little Boy" atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima at 8:15 AM on August 6, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This made America the first and only country to use nuclear weapons in warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Survivors described a blinding light, followed by a deafening blast that caused permanent hearing loss in many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The ground temperature reached 4,000Â°C, instantly vaporizing people and leaving only their shadows etched onto rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Shockwaves and hurricane-force winds created by temperature changes swept debris, and minutes later, the sky was covered in black toxic dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. 70% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

Half an hour after the blast, black, poisonous rain, formed from toxic dust mixed with moisture, began to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. 90% of healthcare workers were killed and hospitals destroyed, leaving no one to help the injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Many survivors died later from radiation sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Despite the devastation, Japanese military fanatics initially refused to even hold a meeting, deeming the bombing insignificant and unnecessary for surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### [[the_impact_of_atomic_bombings_on_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | Nagasaki (August 9, 1945)]]

Three days later, on August 9, 1945, America dropped a second, more powerful atom bomb, "Fat Man," on Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This bomb created a larger mushroom cloud, immediately killing 40,000 people and destroying a 6.7 kmÂ² radius of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

Despite its greater power, Nagasaki experienced fewer casualties than Hiroshima due to warnings issued to people in other cities after Hiroshima, prompting many to evacuate to the outskirts, and the presence of hills around Nagasaki that lessened the explosion's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

In total, these two bombings killed 200,000 people, 95% of whom were civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Japan's Surrender

After the Nagasaki bombing, the Japanese Supreme Council finally met to discuss surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Some members feared continued US bombing, but many remained against surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The Council vote tied at 3:3, leading to Emperor Hirohito being asked to break the tie, and he finally agreed to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

Another significant factor in the surrender was the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan and its invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria, just hours before the Nagasaki bombing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. The combination of US bombings and Soviet attacks, along with increasing unrest in occupied territories, led to the Emperor's decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

Some Japanese military personnel attempted an unsuccessful coup against the Emperor following the surrender announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. On August 15, 1945, World War II officially ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

## Aftermath and Reconstruction

The Allies occupied Japan until 1952, during which a new constitution was adopted, democracy was established, and the Emperor's status became a powerless figurehead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

The total cost of destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was $970 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Reconstruction efforts began almost immediately, with volunteers from other cities helping to rebuild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Today, these cities show little sign of the nuclear attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

While many survivors suffered disabilities, and their children were born with disabilities and increased cancer risks, the long-term [[the_impact_of_atomic_bombings_on_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | radiation levels]] were not as harmful as in [[impact_of_the_chernobyl_disaster | Chernobyl]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. A typhoon later reduced radiation levels, and the nature of a nuclear bomb explosion differs from a nuclear power plant accident in terms of long-term contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

## Debate on Justification ([[us_perspective_and_decision_behind_using_nuclear_weapons | US Perspective and Decision Behind Using Nuclear Weapons]])

The decision to drop the atomic bombs remains a highly debated moral and strategic question today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

### Arguments for Justification

US President Harry Truman and many US diplomats and military officials believed the bombings were a necessity with no other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. They argued that the alternatives were either Operation Downfall or using the bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. After the Battle of Okinawa, it was estimated that Operation Downfall could take at least 10 years and cost 1 million US soldiers' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. From this perspective, 200,000 casualties from the atomic bombs were considered a lesser evil than 1 million US military deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. They also claimed ignorance of the long-term effects of radiation sickness on human bodies at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

### Arguments Against Justification

Critics present several counter-arguments:
*   **Civilian Targets**: They question why cities with 95% civilians were bombed instead of Japanese islands with military facilities, which could still have conveyed a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   **Redundancy of Nagasaki Bombing**: It's argued that the Nagasaki bombing was "utterly pointless" because the Soviet Union had already invaded Japan hours prior, and Japan would have surrendered once attacked by both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. Some experts believe the Soviet invasion, not the atomic bombs, was the primary reason for Japan's surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **Moral Dilemma**: A fundamental question is raised about the moral right of a leader to choose to kill 200,000 civilians to save a potential 1 million of their own soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. A US psychologist proposed that the US President should have to personally murder a volunteer to access nuclear codes, forcing a direct confrontation with the sacrifice involved in such a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

A 1991 survey showed 63% of Americans believed the bombings were justified, while only 29% of Japanese people agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. The fact that neither percentage is at an extreme suggests the complexity of the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

The atomic bombings served as a stark lesson to the world about the devastating impact of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. Fortunately, no other country has used nuclear bombs since then, a trend that the world hopes will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

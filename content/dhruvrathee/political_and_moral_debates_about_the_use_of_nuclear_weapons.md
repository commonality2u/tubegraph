The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 by the United States remain a highly debated topic, raising profound political and moral questions about the use of nuclear weapons.

## The Atomic Bombings: A Brief Overview

On August 6, 1945, at 8:15 AM, an American Boeing B-29 aircraft dropped the "Little Boy" atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Within seconds, the bomb blast created an instant fireball with temperatures reaching 4,000°C, instantly killing 80,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Survivors described a blinding light followed by a deafening blast that caused permanent hearing loss for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. People within the radius were instantly vaporized, leaving only their shadows on rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. The city was almost completely wiped out, with 70% of its buildings destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Approximately half an hour after the blast, black, poisonous rain containing toxic dust fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Most healthcare workers and hospitals were destroyed, leaving survivors without aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Many who didn't die instantly succumbed to radiation sickness days, weeks, or months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

Despite the devastation in Hiroshima, the Japanese military fanatics refused to even meet, considering it insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Three days later, on August 9, 1945, a second, more powerful atomic bomb, "Fat Man," was dropped on Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This bomb immediately killed 40,000 people and destroyed a 6.7 km² radius of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Total casualties from both bombings reached 200,000 people, 95% of whom were civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

## US Justification and Decision-Making

The decision to use atomic bombs was made by US President Harry Truman, who took office after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in April 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He learned about the top-secret [[the_development_and_testing_of_nuclear_weapons_during_world_war_ii | Manhattan Project]] and its successful test of the first atomic bomb on July 16, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

On July 26, 1945, the US, China, and Great Britain issued the Potsdam Declaration, demanding Japan's unconditional surrender and warning of "prompt and utter destruction" if they refused, without specifying what this meant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Japan rejected this declaration on July 29, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. President Truman then authorized the atomic bombings on August 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

President Truman and many US diplomats and military officials believed the bombings were a necessity with no other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Their primary argument was that it saved American lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. They considered two main options to end the war with Japan:
1.  **Operation Downfall (Full-scale Invasion):** After the bloody Battle of Okinawa, where 12,000 American soldiers were killed and 50,000 injured against 110,000 Japanese soldiers and 100,000 Okinawan civilians, US military heads estimated that a full-scale invasion of Japan could take at least 10 years and cost 1 million American soldiers' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. The Japanese were highly brainwashed by Emperor Hirohito, viewing death for the Emperor as the greatest honor and surrender as humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This cultural indoctrination, including Kamikaze suicide attacks, made ground combat exceptionally costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
2.  **Dropping the Nuclear Bombs:** From this perspective, the 200,000 deaths from the atomic bombs, though tragic, were deemed far fewer than the projected 1 million American casualties from a prolonged conventional invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. US officials claimed they were not fully aware of the long-term effects of radiation sickness on human bodies at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

> "Well, I thought it was a blessing. And I thought it could be used to make a blessing. I never worried about this being a curse I wanted a weapon that would win the war, and it did. That's what I was interested in." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>
> — Harry Truman

## Criticisms and Counter-Arguments

Critics present several arguments against the US decision to use atomic weapons:

*   **Targeting Civilians:** Opponents question why cities with 95% civilians were targeted instead of military facilities on an isolated Japanese island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. The US military countered that the brainwashed Japanese military would not have surrendered even after a demonstration bombing on a smaller island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
*   **Other Options and Timing:** Some experts contend that the second bomb on Nagasaki was "utterly pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. A few hours before the Nagasaki bombing, the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan and invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Critics argue that Japan would have surrendered soon after being attacked by both the US and the Soviet Union, making the second bomb unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Soviet Invasion as Key Factor:** Some historians argue that the Soviet invasion, rather than the atomic bombings, was the primary reason for Japan's surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. Emperor Hirohito's decision to surrender was influenced by both the US bombings and the Soviet Union's declaration of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Moral Dilemma:** A significant ethical question arises: who gave the US President the right to choose to kill 200,000 people over the potential death of 1 million US soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>? Critics argue that it's easy for politicians to make such decisions from a distance, but the morality is complicated when considering personal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. One US psychologist suggests that a volunteer should carry the nuclear codes, requiring the president to personally kill the volunteer to access them, thus confronting the moral weight of the decision directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Lasting Impact

The debate continues to this day. A 1991 survey revealed that 63% of Americans believed the bombings were justified, while only 29% of Japanese people shared this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. The fact that opinions are not unanimous in either country highlights the complexity of the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

Despite the devastating impact on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which cost $970 million to rebuild and saw volunteers from other cities contributing to their restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, the bombings served as a stark lesson to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. Fortunately, no other country has used nuclear weapons since then, underscoring the global recognition of their catastrophic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

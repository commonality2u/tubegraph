More than 50 years after the historic [[apollo_11_moon_landing_recount | Apollo 11 mission]], many people refuse to believe that humans actually landed on the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These individuals often propose [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | theories]] suggesting the entire mission was a fabrication by America, with scenes filmed on Earth to deceive the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Origin of the Theories

The [[apollo_11_moon_landing_recount | Apollo 11 mission]] was planned in the context of the Cold War between America and the Soviet Union, primarily as a Space Race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. After the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, and sent the first person, Yuri Gagarin, into space in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, the US President John F. Kennedy pledged to send humans to the Moon and return them safely by the end of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Some find it suspicious that America achieved this goal in 1969, just a year before the decade's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, leading to the idea that the mission might have been faked for geopolitical advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

## Common Conspiracy Theories and Debunking

Despite their prevalence, many [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | conspiracy theories]] surrounding the Moon landing have been debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

### Soviet Acknowledgment
If the Moon landing were a hoax, the Soviet Union, America's Cold War rival, would have never acknowledged it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. However, the Moon landing was affirmed as factual multiple times in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, published between 1970 and 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Soviet articles even cited the [[apollo_11_moon_landing_recount | Apollo landing]] as the third historic event of the space age, following Sputnik's launch and Yuri Gagarin's flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

### The "Fluttering" Flag
One common claim is that the American flag planted on the Moon appeared to flutter despite the absence of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>
> [!INFO] Debunking
> The flag taken to the Moon was specially designed with a horizontal rod at the top, in addition to the vertical one, to ensure it would always appear extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Due to a problem during deployment, this horizontal rod could not be fully extended, causing the flag to ripple, which gave the impression of fluttering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. When seen "fluttering" in videos, it's typically when astronauts are holding and moving it, with aluminum rods acting as springs, causing momentary movement before it settles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

### Absence of Stars
Another theory suggests that no stars are visible in photos taken by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>
> [!INFO] Debunking
> The Moon landing occurred during daytime, with direct sunlight hitting the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. The astronauts' white spacesuits were also highly reflective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Cameras of that era lacked the resolution to capture distant stars in bright daylight or against highly reflective subjects, similar to how a modern phone camera with a flash on won't show stars in the background at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

### Inconsistent Shadow Angles
Some theorists point to inconsistencies in shadow angles in Moon landing photos, arguing that this indicates multiple light sources, as would be found on a film set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>
> [!INFO] Debunking
> The Sun was not the only source of light; the Moon's surface itself acted as a complementary light source, reflecting a significant amount of sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This diffused and scattered light in various directions, leading to the seemingly "bizarre" shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

### Camera Reflection and Photos of Armstrong
A photo of Buzz Aldrin shows Neil Armstrong's reflection in Aldrin's visor, but also appears to show a camera in Armstrong's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Additionally, some question who took the photos of Armstrong descending from the Lunar Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>
> [!INFO] Debunking
> Neil Armstrong was not holding a camera in his hand; his camera was mounted on his suit, allowing him to control it from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. As for the photos of Armstrong descending, multiple cameras were installed on the Lunar Module itself to capture these moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

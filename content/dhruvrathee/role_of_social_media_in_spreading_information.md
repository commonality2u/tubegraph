The dissemination of information, particularly in the digital age, has undergone significant transformation. While traditional media channels once held primary responsibility, the landscape has shifted, with social media platforms now playing a crucial role in shaping public discourse and informing citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Evolution of Information Sharing

Historically, news channels in India have shown variations in their approach to reporting, differing between eras of Congress and BJP governments, and during the Vajpayee administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. However, a growing trend indicates that the responsibility of exposing lies and uncovering the truth, traditionally belonging to the mainstream media, has been increasingly outsourced to other individuals and platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

In India, media outlets have been observed to approve statements without prior verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. During demonetization, some Hindi newspapers printed contradictory statements from Jaitley and Rahul Gandhi side-by-side, leaving the public to interpret the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This contrasts with the media's inherent responsibility to seek truth and question government actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Challenges of Misinformation and Media Integrity

The rise of fake messages, often circulated through platforms like [[whatsapp_misinformation_and_its_impact_on_society | WhatsApp]], has become a significant challenge, with these messages frequently spreading misinformation about religion, country, caste, planning, and history, leading many to believe them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This has contributed to an "empire of lies" that has altered the perceptions of readers and viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Concerns about media integrity are not unique to India. The World Press Freedom Index ranks India at 138 out of 180 countries, significantly lower than developed nations, which typically fall within the top 20-30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Foreign audiences have even perceived clips of Indian journalists as comedic entertainment rather than serious reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. In contrast, media in other countries generally maintains a calmer tone, focuses on facts, and avoids unnecessary debates, particularly on religious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

There has been a decline in public respect for Indian media since around 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Mainstream media often prioritizes less important news, such as a vague statement from Rahul Gandhi, over critical issues like a finance bill legalizing corruption where donor names remain undisclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The inability or unwillingness of mainstream media to track official promises, as the Washington Post does for US presidents (e.g., President Trump's 6,420 false promises in 649 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, highlights a gap in accountability in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Social Media as an Alternative Platform

In this context, social media platforms have emerged as crucial avenues for independent reporting and information dissemination.

### Dhruv Rathee's Example
Dhruv Rathee, a YouTuber with a significant following, began creating videos in 2016 due to frustration with the prevalence of fake news and photoshopped images circulating in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Recognizing social media as a popular platform, he leveraged his interest in making YouTube videos to expose misinformation, similar to the work done by Pratik Sinha and his team from Ahmedabad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Rathee views himself primarily as a YouTuber and an artist who creates journalism-related videos, despite lacking formal journalism qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. He conducts all his research and video editing independently, with each video taking 22-24 hours to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. His work receives significant support, emotionally and financially, from a community of followers, largely Indian citizens and NRIs, who fund his efforts through crowd donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

### Impact and Challenges for Independent Creators
Dhruv Rathee's work aims to help people understand important issues, including critical thinking, mutual funds, stock market, and business startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. He believes that social media is a powerful tool to educate people, enabling individuals to make informed decisions before voting by checking criminal cases against political candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. He notes that his videos have impacted viewers, changing their perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

However, independent creators on social media face challenges:
*   **Suppression:** Mainstream media often attempts to suppress creators who criticize them, sometimes through copyright claims to prevent video usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Troll Army:** A "troll army" creates an environment of abuse in comments, acting as a form of censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Personal Risk:** Exposing the truth often requires personal risk, as powerful politicians, surrounded by falsehoods, are difficult to challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Individuals like Rathee often maintain their location confidentially due to threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

## Polarization and Bubbles
Social media also contributes to [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | polarization]]. Starting with an argument on social media, users are often shown more of the same content they engage with or agree with, leading to the formation of "bubbles" where individuals primarily encounter opinions aligning with their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. While Indian media contributes to this division in India, social media plays a similar role abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

Ultimately, the role of social media in spreading information is multifaceted. It offers a vital platform for independent voices and exposes misinformation, but it also presents challenges related to [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | misinformation]], suppression, and the creation of echo chambers.

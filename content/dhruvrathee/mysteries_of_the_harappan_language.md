The [[discovery_of_the_indus_valley_civilization | Indus Valley Civilization]], also known as the Harappan Civilization, has revealed much about its advanced urban planning and societal structure since its initial findings in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. However, despite extensive archaeological efforts, two major mysteries persist: the meaning of the Harappan language and the reasons for the civilization's decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## The Undeciphered Indus Script

The primary challenge in fully understanding the Harappan people stems from the fact that their language remains undeciphered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Over 4,000 artifacts, including stone slabs, tablets, and copper plates, have been unearthed with engravings in their script, known as the Indus Script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. These inscriptions have been found across various historical sites like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Since the 1920s, more than a hundred attempts have been made to decipher the script, but the meaning of its symbols remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

### Characteristics of the Indus Script

Despite the inability to fully translate the script, historians have identified several key characteristics:

*   **Direction of Writing** The Indus Script was written from right to left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. This is inferred from the observation that symbols on the left side of inscriptions often appear cramped, similar to how a person might narrow their writing when running out of space on a page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   **Association with Animal Symbols** In many instances, the text in Indus Script is accompanied by a large engraved symbol of an animal beneath it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Common animal depictions include rhinoceroses, elephants, tigers, and bulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. The most frequently found symbol is a creature resembling a unicorn, which may not have existed in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The reason for this consistent pairing with animal imagery is still unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Small Scale Engravings** While they may appear large in images, the stone seals containing these engravings are typically small, ranging from 2.5 cm² to 5 cm² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Number of Signs** The Indus Script comprises approximately 400 distinct signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. This extensive number of symbols, compared to, for example, the 26 alphabets in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>, suggests that it is likely a Logosyllabic Script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. In a logosyllabic script, symbols represent entire words or sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. Some identifiable symbols include stick figures, fish, turtles, crabs, insects, and birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

### The Rosetta Stone Conundrum

The primary reason the Indus Script remains undeciphered is the absence of a "Rosetta Stone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. The Egyptian hieroglyphs, for instance, were successfully decoded about 200 years ago because a large rock was discovered containing the same text written in both Egyptian hieroglyphs and ancient Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Since Greek was already understood, this artifact served as a "Google Translate" of its time, allowing historians to unlock the meaning of Egyptian symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. No such bilingual tablet has been found for the Indus Script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

### Observed Patterns and Mesopotamian Connections

Despite the lack of a translation key, historians have identified certain patterns within the Indus language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. For example, a diamond-shaped symbol is consistently followed by two parallel lines but never by a stick figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. The most common symbol is a jar-shaped one, which often appears at the end of texts, possibly signifying a full stop or end of a sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

A significant discovery was finding the Indus Script in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq and Iran) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. This indicates that there were trade relations and movement of people between the two ancient civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Interestingly, the Indus Script found in Mesopotamia sometimes showed the jar-shaped symbol repeated twice, a pattern not observed in Indus Valley sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. Historians theorize that Mesopotamians might have been using the Indus Script to write their own language, similar to how Hindi can be written using the Latin (English) script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. This practice could explain the different patterns observed in the script when used outside the Indus Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

Without the ability to read the Indus Script, much of the daily life, beliefs, and governance of the Harappan people remain speculative. The inability to decipher their language significantly hinders a deeper understanding of this remarkable ancient civilization.

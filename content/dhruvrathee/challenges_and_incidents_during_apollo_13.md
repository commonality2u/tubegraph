The [[apollo_13_mission_overview | Apollo 13 mission]], launched on April 11, 1970, from Kennedy Space Center, aimed to send three astronauts to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Less than a year after [[apollo_11_moon_landing_recount | Neil Armstrong]] first stepped on the moon, this was NASA's third mission designed to land humans there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite the confidence from previous successes, the crew's dream of walking on the moon would ultimately not come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Mission Context and Fading Interest

In the context of the Cold War and the space race with the Soviet Union, American President John F. Kennedy had promised to land a man on the moon and return him safely before the end of the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. With the successful [[apollo_11_moon_landing_recount | Apollo 11]] and Apollo 12 missions in 1969, Kennedy's promise was fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, this success led to a drastic decrease in public and government interest in space spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. People found the excitement of moon landings fading after the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This resulted in budget cuts for NASA and the cancellation of many future missions, such as Apollo 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The [[apollo_13_mission_overview | Apollo 13 mission]] thus came at a crucial time, requiring NASA to prove the continued value of space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Its primary objective was not only to inspect the moon's soil but also to develop human capability to work in the lunar environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Spacecraft Components
The [[apollo_13_mission_overview | Apollo 13]] spacecraft shared a similar design with previous missions, comprising four main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>:
*   **Command Module (CM)**: The main part, housing the three astronauts, instrument panels, navigation gear, radios, life support system, and small engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. It was designed for re-entry to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Service Module (SM)**: Contained most of the astronauts' oxygen, additional engines, and fuel cells for electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The Command and Service Module were collectively known as CSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Lunar Module (LM)**: Intended for landing on the moon and reattaching to the CSM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. It was designed for two astronauts for about 20 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Launch Escape System (LES)**: A safety component designed to eject astronauts to safety during a launch accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. It was jettisoned after a successful launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The crew consisted of Commander Jim Lovell, Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, and Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Notably, none of them were originally chosen for this mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## The Explosion in Space

For the first two days, the mission proceeded smoothly, with one astronaut even lightheartedly asking Mission Control about filing his income tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. However, on April 13, the third day of the mission, approximately 6 and a half minutes after a television broadcast from the spacecraft, flight controllers on the ground asked astronaut Swigert to perform a routine check of the oxygen level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Suddenly, a huge explosion occurred, triggering many warning lights and alarms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Commander Lovell reported, "Houston, we've had a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. It was quickly discovered that one oxygen tank was completely empty, and the other was rapidly losing oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Mission Control initially suspected instrument malfunction but soon confirmed the dire situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Cause of the Explosion
The explosion was traced to a design flaw and previous damage to oxygen tank number 2, located in the Service Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This tank had been installed in Apollo 10 but was removed for modification and accidentally fell during repair, sustaining internal tube damage that went unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

During testing, the tank would not completely empty, leading engineers to use internal heaters to boil off residual oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It was later discovered that the thermometer inside could only register up to 30°C, while the heaters could raise the temperature to 538°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. This extreme heating damaged the insulation of the electrical wires inside the tank, leading to a spark and the explosion during the routine check on the third day of the [[apollo_13_mission_overview | Apollo 13 mission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The explosion, located on the exterior of the spacecraft, caused a 13-foot panel in the service module to be damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Had it occurred inside, the astronauts would have been killed instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## [[rescue_and_problemsolving_strategies_in_apollo_13 | Rescue and Problem-Solving Strategies]]

At the time of the explosion, the spacecraft was approximately 330,000 km from Earth, moving further away by the second due to the blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The astronauts eventually set a new record for human distance from Earth, reaching 400,000 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The immediate concern shifted from landing on the moon to ensuring the astronauts' safe return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Choosing a Return Path
Two options were considered for returning to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>:
1.  **Fastest way**: Rotate the spacecraft and fire the main engine of the Service Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This was risky as the engine was near the blast site and might have been damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
2.  **Long way**: Travel towards the moon, circle it, and then return to Earth, avoiding the use of the Service Module's main engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This would take 4-5 days, raising concerns about dwindling oxygen and water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

NASA's flight director chose the second, longer path, instructing the astronauts to shut down the CSM module and use the Lunar Module (LM) as a lifeboat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

### Lunar Module as a Lifeboat
The LM, originally designed for two astronauts for 20 hours, now had to support three for 4-5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. To conserve supplies and energy, all non-essential systems, including heaters, were shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The LM's engines, not designed for repeated firing, were used for course corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

The first "Burn" of the LM engine put them on a new path, taking them around the far side of the moon, making them the first humans to travel so far from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. A second burn, calculated by engineers, reduced the estimated flight time from 153 hours to 143 hours, providing an 11-hour margin of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Carbon Dioxide and Resource Management
A critical challenge was the rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The LM's lithium hydroxide canisters, which remove CO2, were sufficient for only two people for two days, not three people for four days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. While the Command Module had canisters, their square filters did not fit the LM's circular openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

Ground experts, with 24 hours to find a solution, instructed the astronauts to use available materials like plastic bags, cardboard, suit hoses, and duct tape to build an improvised adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This "contraption," though not aesthetically pleasing, successfully lowered CO2 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

Resource conservation extended to water, with astronauts instructed to drink no more than 200 ml per day to avoid excessive urination, which could affect the spacecraft's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. The three astronauts collectively lost 14 kg of weight, and astronaut Haise developed a urinary tract infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

### Final Burn and Re-entry
Upon nearing Earth after four days, the astronauts realized the spacecraft was off-track due to unaccounted-for cooling vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Commander Lovell performed a third burn of the lunar module, bringing the spacecraft back on course, despite the LM being designed for only one burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

For re-entry, the astronauts had to return to the Command Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. As the Command Module entered Earth's atmosphere, a communication blackout occurred, typically lasting 2-3 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. However, this time, it extended beyond 3 minutes, causing intense anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. After 4 minutes and 27 seconds, communication was finally re-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. The Command Module successfully deployed its parachute and landed in the Pacific Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Outcome and Legacy

All three astronauts returned home safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Although the [[apollo_13_mission_overview | Apollo 13 mission]] failed in its primary goal of a moon landing, it became a historic rescue mission, demonstrating teamwork, leadership, and "thinking outside the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

The incident led to an investigation, and many safety measures were adopted by NASA to prevent similar accidents in future missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Following [[apollo_13_mission_overview | Apollo 13]], Apollo 14, 15, 16, and 17 were all successful, with Apollo 17 in December 1972 being the last NASA mission under the Apollo program to send humans to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

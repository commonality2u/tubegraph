The development of the first nuclear weapons culminated in a secret test in the New Mexico desert in July 1945, a project led by [[j_robert_oppenheimers_role_in_the_manhattan_project | J. Robert Oppenheimer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This event marked a significant turning point in human history, forever changing warfare and global politics.

## J. Robert Oppenheimer: The "Father of the Atomic Bomb"

Julius Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb, directed the Manhattan Project, which created the first nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Born in New York City in 1904 to a German Jewish family, Oppenheimer was considered a child genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. By the age of 10, he was studying high-level physics and chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, and at 12, he was invited to lecture at New York's Mineralogical Club due to his extensive knowledge of mineralogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. He completed his four-year degree at Harvard in three years, majoring in chemistry while also being knowledgeable in physics, philosophy, literature, and Eastern religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Despite his brilliance, Oppenheimer reportedly had self-destructive tendencies, was a chain smoker, and suffered from depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

Oppenheimer's political awareness grew in the early 1930s with the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Many German scientists, including Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, Leo Szilard, Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, and Enrico Fermi, fled Germany for America due to Hitler's tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. As Oppenheimer himself came from a German-Jewish family, he became more interested in politics after observing the atrocities against Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of the Nuclear Weapon Project

In September 1939, Hitler's invasion of Poland marked the [[early_invasions_in_world_war_ii | beginning of World War 2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Although America initially sought to avoid involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, preparations for the worst were underway. A month before the war began, in August 1939, Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard wrote a letter to American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning him that Hitler was developing nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. In response, President Roosevelt immediately formed an advisory committee on uranium to research its potential as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

The American government began funding Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard to research nuclear chain reactions and the separation of uranium isotopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Naturally found uranium is primarily uranium-238, with less than 1% being the U-235 isotope, which is necessary for bomb creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. The initial challenge was to find a way to produce uranium-235 from uranium-238 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

In December 1940, another radioactive element, plutonium, was discovered, which scientists believed could also be used for nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Plutonium was later found to be more radioactive and fissionable than Uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

On October 11, 1941, President Roosevelt proposed collaboration with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on atomic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. Less than two months later, on December 7, 1941, [[reasons_for_japans_involvement_in_world_war_ii | Japan attacked Pearl Harbor]], leading to America's official entry into [[role_of_the_united_states_in_changing_wwii_dynamics | World War 2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This transformed the scientific mission of developing nuclear weapons into a military one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

## The Manhattan Project Begins

The United States invested \$2.2 billion (equivalent to \$24 billion today) in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. President Roosevelt approved the involvement of the Army Corps of Engineers in June 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Their headquarters, located in Manhattan, New York City, were named the Manhattan Engineer District, officially launching the Manhattan Project on August 13, 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

Colonel Leslie Richard Groves was appointed head of the project on September 17, 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. He decided to appoint Oppenheimer as the leader for the design of the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. To maintain secrecy, a remote location, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (also known as the Secret City), was chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. Thousands of scientists, researchers, and workers were moved there with the sole task of creating Uranium-235 from Uranium-238 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

Four methods were explored for U-235 production: gaseous diffusion, centrifuge, electromagnetic separation, and liquid thermal diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Electromagnetic separation and gaseous diffusion proved partially successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Simultaneously, scientists in Washington worked on producing plutonium from Uranium-238 by bombarding it with a hydrogen isotope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. A third secret location, Project Y, was established in Pecos Valley, New Mexico, where the actual bomb design and assembly would take place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

### First Chain Reaction and Oppenheimer's Leadership

On December 2, 1942, scientist Enrico Fermi conducted the first successful practical experiment, achieving a nuclear chain reaction in a squash court at the University of Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. This confirmed the theoretical feasibility of the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

Despite concerns from some senior military members about Oppenheimer's left-wing ideology and his communist friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>, General Groves strongly supported him, stating the project could not succeed without him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. Consequently, Oppenheimer was made the lead of Project Y on July 20, 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. His expertise was crucial for calculating the "critical mass" â€“ the minimum amount of Uranium-235 or Plutonium needed to sustain a chain reaction and trigger an explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

### Designing the Bombs

The project aimed to develop two types of atomic bombs:

1.  **Little Boy**: This bomb was based on Uranium-235 and used a gun-type design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. Two sub-critical masses of Uranium-235 were rapidly combined to reach critical mass, initiating a fission chain reaction and an explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.
2.  **Fat Man**: This more complex bomb utilized plutonium-239 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. A gun-type design wouldn't work as plutonium would react too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. Instead, scientists devised an "implosion method," where a sub-critical mass of plutonium inside a hollow sphere was subjected to high pressure and density by surrounding explosives, forcing it to reach critical mass and explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.

## The Trinity Test

Oppenheimer insisted on testing the implosion method before deploying it in a bomb, despite General Groves' reluctance due to limited plutonium supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. This led to the Trinity Test, the first nuclear bomb test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Conducted on July 16, 1945, at 5:30 AM, in the New Mexico desert, the test involved a bomb called "Gadget," containing 13 pounds of plutonium, suspended 100 feet in the air on a steel tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. The explosion was 50 times more powerful than Oppenheimer anticipated, estimated at 15-20 kilotons of TNT, compared to his expectation of 0.3 kilotons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. The heat from the blast evaporated the steel tower, and the shockwave was felt 160 km away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. The mushroom cloud rose to 12 km in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. A mildly radioactive green glass, named Trinitite, formed after the blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
</div>
Oppenheimer, a Sanskrit scholar who had studied the Bhagavad Gita in its original form, uttered these lines upon witnessing the immense power of the explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. He considered the Bhagavad Gita one of the most influential books of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.

## After the Tests: A New Era

Less than a month after the Trinity Test, the Little Boy bomb was dropped on [[atomic_bombings_of_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. Three days later, the plutonium Fat Man bomb was dropped on [[atomic_bombings_of_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | Nagasaki]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. Albert Einstein's reaction to the news was, "Woe is me," and he is also quoted as saying, "Mankind invented the atomic bomb, but no mouse would ever construct a mousetrap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

Oppenheimer initially expressed happiness after the Hiroshima bombing, wishing it could have been used against Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>. However, he was shocked by the Nagasaki bombing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. On August 17, he met the Secretary of War in Washington to advocate for banning nuclear weapons, expressing deep regret for his role in creating the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. He saw the Hiroshima bomb as a necessary evil but feared the future implications of this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.

When Oppenheimer met President Harry Truman (who became president after Roosevelt's death in April 1945) two months after Nagasaki, he stated, "I have blood on my hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. President Truman reacted angrily, instructing his secretary to remove Oppenheimer from his office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>.

Oppenheimer later worked with the US Atomic Energy Commission to establish control over nuclear weapons and prevent future attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>. In 1949, he strongly opposed President Truman's idea of creating a hydrogen bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Despite his opposition, America developed and tested a hydrogen bomb in 1952, with Edward Teller, now known as the "Father of the Hydrogen Bomb," playing a key role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

Oppenheimer's resistance and left-wing ideology led to him losing his job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. He spent the remainder of his life in academia, giving lectures worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize three times but never won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>. Oppenheimer died in 1965 at the age of 62 from throat cancer, likely due to his lifelong chain smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.

Today, nine countries possess nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan, China, the USA, France, the UK, Israel, Russia, and North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. However, no nuclear weapon has been used in conflict in the 80 years since 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>.

Vinesh Phogat's journey to the Paris Olympics was marked by triumph and sudden disqualification, shocking the wrestling world. Her story, which has been described as an inspiration, fits the line from Dangal's title song: "From the womb to the grave, your story is an inspiration, Dangal Dangal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Her life has been a [[struggles_and_challenges_faced_by_vinesh_phogat | struggle]] from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Paris Olympics Performance Leading to Disqualification

At the Paris Olympics, Vinesh Phogat's first match was against Tokyo Olympics gold medalist Yui Susaki, who had an impressive 82-0 record before this bout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Vinesh, surprisingly, turned the match around in the last 15 seconds, securing a historic victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This win made her a favorite for the gold medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

She continued her winning streak, defeating European champion Oksana Livash 7-5 in the quarter-final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In the semi-final, she beat Pan-American Games Champion Yusnevlis Guzman of Cuba 5-0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to reach an Olympic final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Her final opponent was American wrestler Sarah Hildebrandt, a Tokyo Olympics bronze medalist, whom Vinesh had previously defeated twice in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Her gold medal win was considered "almost sure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

However, the next day brought news of her disqualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. She was disqualified for being overweight by just 100 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### The Weigh-in Ordeal
On the first day, Vinesh weighed 49.9 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. After the weigh-in, wrestlers typically have a recovery meal and rehydrate, leading to normal weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The plan was for her weight to increase by 1.5 kg, which would be cut down overnight before the second weigh-in for the final match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

After her semi-final match, Vinesh's weight was 52.7 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. She had 12 hours to lose 2.7 kg before the 7:15 AM weigh-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. She spent the entire night without sleep, food, or water, running, skipping, cycling, going to the sauna, cutting her hair, and having blood drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Despite these efforts, she lost 2.6 kg, but still had 100 grams extra by 7:15 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Due to the strict weigh-in time of 7:15 AM to 7:30 AM, she couldn't lose the remaining weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Aftermath and Reactions

Following her disqualification, 2012 Olympic gold medalist Jordan Burroughs appealed on Twitter for a rule change and suggested Vinesh be awarded the silver medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The difficulty in weight reduction was attributed to her natural weight being around 55-56 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. However, she had previously won gold in the 50 kg category at the Spanish Grand Prix in July and secured her Olympic quota in the same category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Vinesh Phogat announced her retirement on Twitter shortly after, stating, "Mother, wrestling won over me, I lost. Forgive me, your dream, my courage, everything lies shattered. I don't have any more strength. Goodbye, wrestling, 2001 - 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Political and Public Responses
Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya highlighted the â‚¹7 million spent on Vinesh for the Paris Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. BJP MP Hema Malini made an insensitive remark, saying, "It feels so strange that because of 100 grams, she was disqualified. I wish she loses that 100g quickly. But the medal is gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. On social media, Vinesh faced criticism and mockery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Context: Why 50kg?

Vinesh competed in the 50 kg category because the quota for the 53 kg category went to Antim Panghal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This was tied to the [[wrestling_federation_of_indias_policy_and_trials | WFI's controversial policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. The WFI had initially stated that quota winners would undergo trials but suddenly announced on May 21st that there would be no trial for the 53kg category, calling it a "one-time-only exemption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

Had the trials occurred, Vinesh, who finished in the top 4 in the 53 kg category during the Patiala trials, might have defeated Antim and competed in her preferred weight class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. Distrustful of WFI's decisions, Vinesh decided to compete in both 53 kg and 50 kg categories in the Patiala trials to secure her chance for the Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. She eventually secured her quota in the 50 kg category at the Asian Wrestling Olympic qualifiers in Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

## WFI's Conduct and Lack of Support

Vinesh faced challenges from the [[controversy_and_criticism_involving_wrestling_federation_of_india_wfi | Wrestling Federation of India (WFI)]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In the Tokyo Olympics, despite repeated requests, she was not provided a dedicated physiotherapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This was critical for weight cutting and regaining strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. She had to rely on a physiotherapist accompanying the shooting team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

### Health Issues and Mental Health
Vinesh was diagnosed with depression two years before the Tokyo Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. She struggled with sleep and became emotionally fragile, even crying when coaches raised their tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. She sought help from a psychologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

She also battled COVID-19 twice, which affected her ability to digest protein, crucial for a wrestler's physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. On the day of her Tokyo Olympic bout, she woke up in pain, started vomiting, and felt her health deteriorating, eventually shivering and blanking out during her second bout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Accusations and Suspension by WFI
After her Tokyo loss, WFI accused Vinesh of indiscipline and suspended her, issuing a show-cause notice based on three charges: not staying or training with teammates, and not wearing her kit sponsor's jersey during the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

Vinesh, through her lawyer, formally replied, explaining that she followed quarantine rules by staying with the Indian 4x400 women athletes due to her training in Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Regarding the jersey, she admitted it was an unintentional mistake due to being sick and vomiting before the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

WFI President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh deemed her response unsatisfactory but "forgave" her, threatening a lifetime ban for future mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Vinesh contrasted this with American gymnast Simone Biles, who withdrew from an event at the Tokyo Olympics due to mental health and was supported by USA Gymnastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Vinesh lamented that in India, athletes cannot openly express such struggles without facing judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

### Interference with Foreign Coaches and [[supportive_role_of_ngos_in_indian_wrestling | NGOs]]
WFI also raised allegations against Vinesh's coach, Woller Akos, who had significantly contributed to her success since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. WFI alleged that Akos was training his wife with Vinesh, despite his dedication during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

A major point of contention was WFI's problem with foreign coaches and [[supportive_role_of_ngos_in_indian_wrestling | NGOs]] like Olympic Gold Quest and JSW, which funded these coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. WFI demanded that NGOs stop interfering, claiming it could manage its athletes, despite failing to provide necessary support like dedicated physiotherapists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. In November 2021, WFI mandated its involvement in any contracts between NGOs and wrestlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

## Conclusion

Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the Paris Olympics due to a minor weight issue, compounded by health struggles and [[controversy_and_criticism_involving_wrestling_federation_of_india_wfi | systemic issues within the WFI]] and [[wrestling_federation_of_indias_policy_and_trials | its controversial policies]], highlights the immense [[struggles_and_challenges_faced_by_vinesh_phogat | challenges faced by athletes]] despite their dedication and achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Despite the setbacks, Vinesh Phogat's story of resilience and fight for systemic change continues to inspire future generations of sportspersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

## Introduction to Bigg Boss and Media Integrity
Popular YouTuber Dhruv Rathee clarified that reports of him making a wildcard entry into "Bigg Boss OTT 2" were false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. He stated that no one had invited him, nor had he expressed a desire to join the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This incident highlighted the standard of Indian media, which often publishes unverified news without hesitation, sometimes including disclaimers shifting responsibility to the reader to verify information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Dhruv Rathee unequivocally stated he would never participate in "Bigg Boss," even if offered substantial payment, viewing it as a "very cheap way to earn money and fame which has a bad impact on society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This article will explore the problematic aspects of such shows and why they should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Origins of "Big Brother" and "Bigg Boss"
The concept of "Big Brother" originated in 1999 in the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, drawing inspiration from George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel *1984* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The novel depicts a dictatorial government led by an unknown "Big Brother" who maintains constant surveillance, symbolized by the slogan "Big Brother is watching you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The TV show mirrored this by having people live under constant surveillance and the "command" of Big Brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The show also took inspiration from older reality TV shows like MTV's *The Real World* and Sweden's *Expedition Robinson* (1997) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. "Big Brother" rapidly gained global popularity, with versions emerging in numerous countries including America, Canada, Australia, China, and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. In India, it was adapted into "Bigg Boss," launching in various languages, and later expanding to OTT platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Orwell's *1984* was intended as a warning and a critique of dictatorial governments (like Stalin and Hitler) and their techniques of propaganda, constant surveillance (exemplified by software like Pegasus), historical revisionism, and the creation of cult personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Exploitation of Human Tendencies
Contrary to Orwell's warning, shows like "Big Brother" and "Bigg Boss" provide a "cheapest form of entertainment" by heavily relying on two concepts: [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Sadism]] and [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Voyeurism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Sadism]]
[[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Sadism]] is defined as "the tendency to derive pleasure from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. While extreme forms are associated with psychopaths, a less extreme category known as [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Sadism]] was identified in a 2013 study published in *Psychological Science* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Examples of [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Sadism]] include:
*   Audiences in ancient Roman Colosseums deriving entertainment from gladiators' suffering or death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   People enjoying watching street fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   Bullies humiliating others in schools or colleges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   Individuals kicking or throwing stones at animals without reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   Bosses criticizing employees to inflict mental pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   Mob lynching incidents where crowds beat accused individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   People celebrating the death of political opponents or public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   YouTube channels built on insulting, abusing, or bullying others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   A 2018 study by the University of Innsbruck showed how [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | everyday sadists]] prefer violent video games as they uplift their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   Films like the *Saw* series or *Human Centipede* exploit [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | sadism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

"Bigg Boss" and similar reality TV shows actively exploit [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Sadism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Contestants are constantly fighting, often physically, throwing utensils, and even boiling water at each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. The show's concept encourages this, with tasks like throwing chili powder on faces, bathing in cow dung, or drinking from a dog bowl to humiliate contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Personal matters are leaked, leading to emotional distress, and body shaming, backbiting, misogyny, and homophobia are commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Voyeurism]]
[[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Voyeurism]] refers to "taking cheap pleasure in watching other people's lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

Examples of [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Voyeurism]] include:
*   People searching for leaked MMS videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   The popularity of daily vlogs, where viewers watch mundane aspects of YouTubers' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Some vloggers even exploit this by filming their children crying or arguments at home for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   Enjoying CCTV footage of crimes or accidents, which media houses often broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

"Bigg Boss" extensively exploits [[everyday_sadism_and_voyeurism_in_reality_tv_shows | Everyday Voyeurism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. In "Bigg Boss 16," 98 cameras were installed, and audiences can watch contestants 24x7 via live feeds from multiple cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Contestants are encouraged to share personal secrets on national television to generate content and TRP (Television Rating Point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## [[the_artificial_and_scripted_nature_of_bigg_boss | The Artificial and Manipulated Nature of "Bigg Boss"]]
Despite being called "reality" TV, "Bigg Boss" is far from real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Awareness of Cameras**: Contestants are aware of constant surveillance, making their behavior artificial and self-conscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Artificial Setup**: The show creates an artificial competitive environment that forces contestants to insult and backbite others to "perform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Contestant Selection**: There are no auditions; contestants are chosen by the makers based on their potential for intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   **Heavy Editing**: 24 hours of footage is edited into 50-minute episodes, showing only content that attracts viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. Contestants like Shweta Tiwari, Aashka Goradia, and Hina Khan have confirmed the show is heavily edited, with conversations misrepresented to create misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Aashka Goradia claimed editors made it appear she was a lesbian by manipulating footage of her applying balm to a female contestant's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Viewer Perception and Voting**: Editing influences viewer perception, which in turn affects voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Bent Rules and Decisions**: Eliminations, re-entries, and wild-card entries are decided by the show makers based on "saleability" (TRP), not solely public voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Aman Verma, a contestant, revealed a pre-planned deal to stay only six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. Shekhar Suman, a host, admitted to following a script provided by the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **Task Design**: Tasks are designed by makers to generate conflict, humiliation, and drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. The show lacks intellectual discussion on topics like social issues, philosophy, or science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

Many "nice people" would never go on such shows, and even if they did, they would be provoked to engage in sadism and voyeurism, or risk being eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Sushant Divgikar, a contestant known for his intellect, was quickly eliminated for not engaging in conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav also left, stating the show's format turns humans into "devils" where one must insult others to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Rahul Bhatt, another contestant, refused to "provide entertainment... at the cost of making a fool of myself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | Impact of Reality TV Shows on Viewers and Society]]
Just as junk food affects physical health, "bad reality TV shows" negatively impact the brain, making viewers ruder and increasing aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Psychiatrist Dr. Marcia Sirota claims this leads to increased aggression, even more than violent or crime TV shows, according to psychologist Brian Gibson's study at Central Michigan University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

Such shows mislead the audience into believing that fame and wealth can be achieved through abusing others, engaging in self-serving egoism, or broadcasting personal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. This shapes a societal perception that cheap, negative behavior is the path to success.

## Impact on Contestants' Mental Health
Many contestants have reported significant mental health issues after participating in "Bigg Boss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
*   Contestants who revealed personal secrets often regretted it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   Public perception can unfairly brand contestants as villains, leading to anxiety from criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
*   Several former participants, including Shamita Shetty, Sana Khan, Kushal Tandon, Nikki Tamboli, Kavita Kaushik, Shalin Bhanot, Rahul Vaidya, Himanshi Khurana, Apurva Agnihotri, and Shilpa Saklani, have sought therapy after their time on the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

Viewers are urged to choose their content wisely, considering its impact on their mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. Consuming content that encourages learning and positive growth is recommended for a beneficial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

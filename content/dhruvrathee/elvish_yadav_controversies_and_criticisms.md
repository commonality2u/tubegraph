*   **False claims about audience statistics**: He claimed 50% of Dhruv Rathee's audience was from Pakistan, which was refuted by statistics showing over 80% from India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Accusation of dictatorship**: He labeled Dhruv Rathee a "dictator" for blocking "vile and insolent trolls" on Twitter, while ignoring actual instances of suppression of free speech by media houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## Hypocrisy and Opportunism
Elvish Yadav is accused of being an opportunist who shifts his stance based on convenience:
*   **Selective outrage**: He is criticized for his "us vs. them" mentality, spreading hatred against a specific community, and not speaking out against injustice unless it benefits him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. For example, he did not raise his voice for Hindu women's issues like the Manipur incident or Kashmiri Pandits' strike unless it could be used against Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Changing stances**: He was observed shifting from a "secular" persona (playing cricket with Munawar Farooqui) to a "communal" one (accusing Munawar of being an "anti-Hindu traitor") and back, depending on his immediate needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Political allegiances**: While accusing others of being paid for their content, he himself posted flattering comments and photos with BJP leaders like Smriti Irani and [[Controversies and criticism surrounding Narendra Modi | PM Modi]], stating Modi is "devoted to Ram and our nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## Disrespecting Religion and Promoting Hatred
*   **Anti-Hindu content**: He has been criticized for videos that mock Hindu mantras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a> (which he later removed) and make fun of Hanuman Chalisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a> (which remains online).
*   **Distorting Hindu scriptures**: He sells a hoodie featuring a picture of Lord Ram and the phrase "Violence is Also Religion," which is not found in any Hindu scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.
*   **Promoting genocidal ideology**: His Twitter cover picture depicts a villainous character from the film "Shaurya," Brigadier Pratap, who harbored hatred for Muslims and wanted to kill them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This is seen as reflecting his "thirst for the blood of Muslims all over the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Insensitive remarks on global conflicts**: He morphed the "All Eyes On Rafah" image to "All Eyes On POK," implying that suffering in Rafah was acceptable due to atrocities in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. This is criticized as showing a lack of universal empathy for injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

## Legal and Ethical Issues
*   **Snake venom case**: He was involved in a snake venom case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, and there are allegations of money laundering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
*   **Hit and run incident**: He once hit someone with his car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
*   **Misogynistic content**: His songs contain themes of glamorizing weapons and objectifying women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

These controversies highlight a pattern of behavior that critics argue is harmful to society and contradictory to national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

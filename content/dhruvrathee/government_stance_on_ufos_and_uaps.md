The United States government has maintained a long and evolving stance regarding Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and, more recently, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs). This stance has shifted from initial denials and secrecy to public acknowledgments and official investigations.

## Early UFO Craze and Official Response

In July 1947, a widespread [[history_of_ufo_sightings | craze of UFOs]] swept across America, with people reporting sightings of flying saucers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This public interest began on June 24 when private pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen 9 shining UFOs near Seattle, flying at speeds of 2,000 km per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Within two weeks, similar reports came from across the country, heavily discussed in the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Media outlets linked these sightings to atomic sites, particularly three areas with the most reports, which were sites of nuclear tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Roswell Incident

### Initial Claims and Retraction
The [[roswell_incident_analysis | Roswell Incident analysis]] began when Mac Brazel from New Mexico discovered unusual debris—tin foil, rubber, and a thin wooden beam—on his field three weeks earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Wondering if it was related to the UFO craze, he took the debris to the Roswell Sheriff on July 7, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This caught the attention of Colonel William Blanchard, the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Airfield (RAAF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The next day, RAAF released a statement confirming that "the rumours of the flying disks had come true," claiming the 509th Bomb Group of the 8th Airforce "was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This implied the US Army had proof of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

However, the very next day, US Army Officials retracted their statement, asserting the debris was from a weather balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Photos of Major Marcel with weather balloon pieces were released as "proof," and the news quickly died down, with the public losing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Resurgence of Theories and Later Explanations
Years later, in the late 1970s, rumors re-emerged about an alien craft crashing in the New Mexico desert after being struck by lightning, killing its occupants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. In 1980, Major Marcel's book, *The Roswell Incident*, further fueled this, with Marcel claiming the debris was "from nothing made on this Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This led to new theories, including claims of a living alien being discovered and held by the US Army at a secret base like [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]], where alien technology was supposedly being reverse-engineered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

In 1994, the US Air Force revealed the true nature of the debris: it was from a nuclear surveillance balloon, a spy device developed under Project Mogul, designed to detect sound waves from Soviet nuclear weapon tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Despite this explanation, public skepticism persisted due to repeated governmental misstatements, eroding trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

## Area 51 and Military Secrecy

[[area_51_and_military_secrecy | Area 51 and military secrecy]] have long been intertwined. Area 51 is a highly restricted US Military facility located in the middle of a desert, miles from the nearest cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Signboards outside warn against photography and state that suspicious activity would be met with deadly force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This isolation is partly due to its location on the Nevada Test and Training Range, America's largest government-controlled land, which also includes the Nevada Test Site, where nuclear weapons were tested from the 1950s to the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Cold War Cover-Up
Area 51 was created during the Cold War as a testing and development facility for advanced aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. In the 1950s, crucial American spying aircraft like the U-2 Spy plane were tested there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. President Dwight D. Eisenhower initiated a High-Altitude Reconnaissance Program in 1954 to develop spy planes against Soviet nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The U-2, designed to fly at 21,000m and go undetected by radar, allowed America to spy on the Soviet Union until one was shot down on May 1, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

Following this, the military developed the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, still the fastest-flying aircraft, capable of speeds up to 3,400 km/h and altitudes of 24,000m <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

To maintain secrecy around these critical military developments during the Cold War, the CIA leveraged [[history_of_ufo_sightings | UFO conspiracy theories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. They neither denied nor confirmed UFO claims, letting people believe the fast, weird-looking objects were alien flying saucers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This strategy prevented the public from discovering they were top-secret US military aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The initial one-day acceptance of the Roswell "flying saucer" theory and subsequent retraction to a "weather balloon" was part of this strategy to avoid widespread fear if alien existence was admitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The resurgence of UFO rumors in the 1970s coincided with the testing of the Blackbird SR-71 aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. The US Airforce project Blue Book investigated UFO sightings, cross-referencing public reports with flight records, and found that most UFO reports in the late 1950s and 1960s were explained by military aircraft tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

## Modern Government Transparency and UAPs

### Declassification and Acknowledgment
In June 2013, the CIA publicly acknowledged the Area 51 base, declassifying secret details of its history under the Freedom of Information Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This release revealed the exact location in the Mojave desert, Nevada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Further, in January 2017, 13 million pages of declassified documents were released online by the CIA, including records of UFO sightings and CIA experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. In January 2021, thousands more UFO documents were declassified, with the agency claiming all their records on UFOs were now available to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

### Shift in Terminology and Active Investigation
Today, the US government avoids the term "UFO" due to its heavy association with aliens, preferring "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" (UAP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

In December 2020, the US government directed the National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense to release all UAP records to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. In April 2020, the US Pentagon released three videos, acknowledging that previously leaked footage from 2007 and 2017 showing UAPs were real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

In August 2020, the Defense Department created a UAP Task Force to detect, analyze, and catalogue UAPs, recognizing them as potential threats to US national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. While many UAPs are eventually identified as weather balloons or other known objects, some incidents lack sufficient data for conclusive identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. It is believed that unidentified UAPs may be part of highly classified programs of other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>, contributing to [[impact_on_usa_and_global_security_measures | global security measures]].

Area 51 remains a facility for testing next-generation aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Despite increased transparency, the government maintains strict security, with trespassing leading to arrest, as demonstrated by the case of a Dutch YouTuber who spent three days in jail for entering Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

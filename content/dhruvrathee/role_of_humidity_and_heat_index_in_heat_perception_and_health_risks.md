While [[extreme_heatwaves_and_recordbreaking_temperatures_in_india_and_southeast_asia | record-breaking temperatures]] are a major concern, the actual perception of heat and its health risks are significantly influenced by humidity and quantified by the Heat Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Understanding Heat Perception

Temperature alone is not a complete measure of how hot the weather feels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. For instance, 45°C in Delhi might feel more tolerable than 38°C in Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. This difference is due to humidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

### What is Humidity?
Humidity refers to the amount of moisture in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. Specifically, "Relative Humidity" indicates the maximum moisture content the air can hold at a particular temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. 100% relative humidity means the air is completely saturated and cannot hold any more moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Hotter air has a greater capacity to retain moisture than cold air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.

### Humidity's Impact on Body Cooling
The more humidity present in the air, the more difficult it becomes for sweat on the body to evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. Sweating is the body's primary mechanism for keeping cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. If sweat cannot evaporate due to high humidity, the body cannot effectively cool itself, which can be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

## The Heat Index

To accurately convey how heat feels, both temperature and humidity must be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. This is where the Heat Index comes in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

*   **Definition**: The Heat Index tells us how hot the weather outside will *feel* to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
*   **"Feels Like"**: Many weather apps display this as "Feels Like" or "Real Feel" temperature, which is computed from the Heat Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. For example, 31°C in Mumbai might feel like 37°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

### Heat Index and Health Risks
The Heat Index can vary significantly based on humidity:
*   If the temperature is 35°C and relative humidity is 50%, it will feel like 41°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.
*   However, at the same 35°C, if the relative humidity is 75%, it will feel like a dangerous 53°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

A Heat Index in the "Red category" signifies extreme danger, where there is a high chance of suffering from heat stroke or sunstroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. This was evident in the Philippines, where the Heat Index reached 53°C, making the heatwave particularly dangerous and deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Even a Heat Index between 32°C and 41°C requires extreme caution, as prolonged sun exposure or physical activity can lead to heat stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

In Delhi, while temperatures are currently high, the Heat Index can touch 50°C and potentially reach 56°C in the coming days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. This situation is expected to worsen by late June when the humidity increases with the onset of the rainy season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

## Future Projections

A study on the Tropical Indian Ocean indicates that in a few years, almost permanent marine heat waves will be observed in the Indian Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>. By 2050, many areas could experience heat waves lasting 220 to 250 days a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. This highlights the growing importance of understanding and addressing the combined effects of temperature and humidity.

North Korea's government, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), maintains an extraordinary level of control over the [[daily_life_under_dictatorship_in_north_korea | daily lives]] of its citizens through extensive propaganda and strict censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This control extends to nearly every aspect of [[government_control_over_personal_lives_in_north_korea | personal life]], from clothing and hairstyles to the media people consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Pervasive Government Control

The government decides where citizens live, what work they do, and where they study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. What people watch on TV, their internet access, travel, and even their hairstyles are all controlled by the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Surveillance and Monitoring
Smartphones in North Korea are heavily censored and cannot make international calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Their operating systems are designed to randomly take screenshots and send them to the government, allowing authorities to monitor user activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. The software coding only displays government-approved content, and apps can only be downloaded from physical stores, not app stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

## Media Censorship and Propaganda

[[government_suppression_of_dissent_and_media | Freedom of expression]] is non-existent, as all media is tightly controlled to serve the state's narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

### Controlled Entertainment
Foreign movies are not released in North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Television and radio only feature government channels, which broadcast content supporting state [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | propaganda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Morning broadcasts typically include the national anthem, tributes to former leaders, cartoons, and news programs that praise the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Kim Jong Un is often presented as a divine figure, with stories promoting him as a god-like leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

### Harsh Penalties for Media Violations
Watching foreign shows and movies is considered a serious crime, punishable by severe penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Examples include:
*   In 2022, two teenagers were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor for watching and distributing a South Korean drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   Also in 2022, a young man was publicly executed for watching and sharing South Korean films and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

Despite these dangers, the severe lack of entertainment in North Korea drives people to secretly smuggle South Korean dramas and movies through local black markets known as Jangmadang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Initially, DVDs were used, leading authorities to randomly cut electricity to trap discs in players and identify violators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. People later switched to USB sticks, which are easier to hide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. When watching foreign media, people often turn off lights and windows and listen at barely audible volumes to avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Internet Limitations
Internet access in North Korea is highly restricted and requires government permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Users are supervised by a librarian who monitors their activity, with the computer screen freezing every five minutes requiring a librarian's fingerprint to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Access is limited to one hour, with extensions requiring further government approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

For common citizens, the government has created an internal internet, or intranet, with a limited number of government-selected websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. This intranet is prohibitively expensive for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Social media is non-existent, and attempts to clone platforms like Facebook and Netflix have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

### [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | Propaganda and Misinformation]]
Propaganda is a core element of North Korean society, used to brainwash citizens and maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. From birth, people are exposed to stories portraying their supreme leader as divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. False narratives are common, such as Kim Jong Un learning to shoot a gun at three years old and ride a horse at five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. News in North Korea solely praises the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. When world news is shown, it is always presented negatively, depicting suffering from corruption, disease, and disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. This contrasts with the portrayal of North Koreans as the happiest and luckiest people due to Kim Jong Un's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

## Personal Appearance Regulations
The government dictates clothing and hairstyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. There are only 15 approved hairstyles for men and 15 for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Kim Jong Un's unique haircut and glasses are forbidden for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Banned:** Hair dyeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, blue jeans, ripped jeans, skinny jeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, branded clothes (seen as Western influence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, tight dresses, short skirts, sun hats for girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, red lipstick, and excessive makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

A "Fashion Police" enforces these rules, cutting non-compliant clothes, issuing fines, or jailing offenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The government views foreign fashion as a "cultural invasion" and a threat to national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. In 2005, a propaganda series titled "Let's trim our hair in accordance with the socialist lifestyle" claimed long hair was unhealthy and reduced intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Suppression of Religion
North Korea is an officially atheist country, where practicing or preaching religion is punishable by death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Christians are particularly targeted, viewed as influenced by America, and thousands are imprisoned and tortured in political prison camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. In 2009, Ri Hyon Ok was publicly executed for distributing the Bible, and her family was sent to a political prison camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

The Kim family is worshipped as a religion, with pictures and statues of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il in every home, office, and school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. The Secret Police conducts house checks, and failure to display or protect these images can lead to prosecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. In 2020, a woman was investigated and denied hospital medicine for her children after saving them instead of the leaders' pictures from a burning house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. A man's father was sent to a political prison camp for accidentally soiling an image of Kim Jong-Il in a newspaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Limitations on Movement
People require government permission to travel domestically, stating their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. International travel is even more restricted, and leaving the country without permission is considered a traitorous act, punishable by [[economy_and_forced_labor_in_north_korea | forced labor]], torture, life imprisonment, or death for the entire family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Shin Dong Hyuk's family was imprisoned because his uncle fled to South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. After COVID, border guards were given "shoot-at-sight" orders for unauthorized crossings, resulting in 14 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

Most escapees flee to China due to easier land borders, but the Chinese government often deports them back to North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. In 2023, approximately 500 people were deported back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## The Secret Police
The Secret Police is the primary enforcer of human rights violations, responsible for disappearances, torture, and operation of [[guilt_by_association_and_political_prison_camps_in_north_korea | political prison camps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Its agents, spies, and informants are ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. They compel individuals from lower Songbun (social class) and Hostile classes to spy on each other, fostering a pervasive distrust where people are suspicious of others, even family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

The Secret Police divides areas into groups of 30-40 houses, each with a neighborhood association that monitors people and encourages spying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. The organization is highly secretive; its telephone book, when leaked in 2002, did not even contain the phone numbers of officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>, and the names of its chiefs are unknown to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

## Weakening Grip
Despite strict controls, there are signs that Kim Jong Un's grip is weakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. The rise of Jangmadang (black markets) has provided a conduit for information about the outside world, shattering government propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. Smuggled foreign media, particularly South Korean dramas, have helped people see through the propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

A significant majority of North Korean defectors (81%) had access to USBs, and 98% of those with USBs carried "illegal media" challenging the government's narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. This shared engagement in illegal activities at markets is fostering trust among people, undermining the government's system of suspicion and distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. Additionally, rampant bribery has become a way of life, with government officials relying on bribes for income, leading to people losing fear of strict rules as they can engage in illegal activities by paying off officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

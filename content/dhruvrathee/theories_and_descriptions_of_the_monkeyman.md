In the spring of 2001, a mysterious entity known as the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] spread terror across Delhi and its surrounding areas, leading to widespread panic and even fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. What began as isolated reports quickly escalated into a mass phenomenon, capturing public and media attention.

## Initial Encounters and Growing Fear

The first reported incident occurred on April 5, 2001, in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, where Anil Gopal was attacked while sleeping on his rooftop due to frequent power cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He was jolted awake around 2 AM, feeling scratches on his arms and legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. In the dark, he could only glimpse a monkey-like figure disappearing into the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Two weeks later, on April 18, another man named Vinod in the same neighborhood reported a similar attack at 3:15 AM by a creature he described as looking like a monkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The very next night, Raihasuddin was severely injured in his hut by a monkey-like creature, requiring 21 days to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Soon, reports of attacks, including scratches, injuries, and bites, spread throughout Delhi and its neighboring areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Victims described the attacker as "half monkey and half human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, giving rise to the name [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Between April and May 2001, Delhi Police received approximately 100 calls from people reporting attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The attacks began in Ghaziabad and soon spread to East Delhi, Noida, and other parts of Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### Impact of the Panic

The widespread terror led to tragic consequences. Three individuals lost their lives due to the panic surrounding the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. People would shout warnings, causing others to run in fear, leading to self-inflicted injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Dozens suffered fractures, and one person died after jumping off a rooftop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. A pregnant woman also died after slipping on stairs out of terror, having only seen a shadow she mistook for the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Varying Descriptions of the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]]

Despite numerous reports, no one had seen the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] up close, leading to widely varying descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Early Descriptions

*   **Human-like:** Initial descriptions leaned more towards a human figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Ajay's account:** One of the first victims, Ajay, described the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] as having fair complexion, blue eyes, a big nose, and believed it to be of Nepali origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Later, More Supernatural Descriptions

As incidents increased, descriptions grew more varied and fantastical:

*   **Monkey-like:** Later victims claimed it was more monkey-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Size:** Descriptions ranged from "tall and broad, 8 feet tall" to "4-5 feet tall," and even "like a housecat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Appearance and Abilities:**
    *   Black fur all over the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    *   Nails "as sharp as knives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
    *   Wore a helmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
    *   Wore a t-shirt with three buttons, supposedly granting powers:
        *   Button 1: Turned man into a monkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
        *   Button 2: Super strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
        *   Button 3: Invisibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
    *   Long, sharp, metallic nails used for scratching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
    *   Red eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
    *   Could jump very high, up to 20 feet between roofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
    *   Believed to wear springs on its feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
    *   Some claimed electric currents ran through its arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

The most popular descriptions included the helmet and metallic nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. With each new incident, the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]]'s description became more supernatural, evolving from a man to a monkey, then to a superhuman being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. This led people to believe it was a shapeshifter, intentionally changing its appearance to mislead and confuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

## Media and Police Response

Local newspapers first reported on the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] on May 14, 2001, leading to an exponential increase in reported cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Mainstream news channels like Star News and Aaj Tak heavily covered the story, further amplifying public fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Some news channels even deployed teams of reporters and cameramen to "hotspot" areas to capture the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] on video, though nothing was ever filmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

The widespread paranoia led people to stop sleeping outdoors and call the police for minor things like shadows or sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. Vigilante groups armed with sticks formed to patrol areas and attack the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. This paranoia resulted in innocent people being attacked, including a man mistaken for the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] by a group of 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, a van driver whose bones were broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>, and a man attacked by his own brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

The Delhi Police, lacking a clear description, attempted to create sketches based on victim accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. Two sketches were released: one with a broad face and big nose, the other with a narrow face, mustache, and sunglasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Police concluded the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] was more human than monkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. Over 3,000 police officers were deployed to hotspots, and authorities ensured uninterrupted power supply in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. On May 17, former Delhi Police Commissioner Ajay Raj Sharma announced a â‚¹50,000 reward for information leading to the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]]'s arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

## Decline of the Phenomenon

After May 25, 2001, [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] incidents gradually declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Delhi Police began taking strict action against fake calls and rumor-mongering, issuing public warnings of jail time for those misleading the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Out of 379 calls received, 303 were found to be fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Arrests were made, including a doctor who had inflated a surgical glove, painted it brown, and claimed it was the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]]'s hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This deterred false reports, and within weeks, media interest faded, and the incidents stopped completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

## Theories and Explanations

In June 2001, various exaggerated theories emerged about the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]]'s disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>:

*   It was orchestrated by America, China, or Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   It disappeared into a jungle, away from human civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
*   It was an alien that had returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.
*   It moved to other parts of the country; for example, incidents of a half-man, half-wolf creature were reported in Assam in May 2001, and similar cases in Mumbai in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

### Mass Hysteria

Psychologists largely attribute the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] phenomenon to [[psychological_theories_and_identity | Mass Hysteria]], or Mass Psychogenic Illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

*   **Definition:** Mass hysteria is a phenomenon where a group of people exhibit unusual, irrational behavior, believe in illogical things, and experience irrational feelings, despite no physical cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. It is contagious and spreads rapidly, particularly in tightly-knit communities like those in India where neighbors and extended family live closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.
*   **Triggers:** This phenomenon can be triggered by stress, anxiety, environmental factors, and psychological factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. In the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] case, shadows or random sounds in the dark acted as triggers, spreading fear like a virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.

Doctors S.K. Verma and D.K. Srivastava of Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in New Delhi investigated 397 calls regarding the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. They found only 51 calls warranted medical examination and concluded that the case was a typical example of [[psychological_theories_and_identity | Mass Hysteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. Their study was published in the *Indian Journal of Medical Sciences* in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

### Factors Contributing to Mass Hysteria

Doctors identified several reasons for the rapid spread of panic and fear:

1.  **High Population Density:** Incidents occurred in densely populated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.
2.  **Socio-Economic Status:** 94% of victims were from poorer sections of society, living in East Delhi's poorest locales, often less educated and more superstitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. They were more prone to imagination over logic and believed stories readily if surrounded by others who did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.
3.  **Media's Role:** The nascent private news channels in 2001 competed for viewership, sensationalizing the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Many people fabricated stories to appear on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. At the time, people were naive and blindly believed everything reported by news channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. Police also blamed the media for fueling the hysteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.
4.  **Psychological and Environmental Stress:** Mass hysteria is common among those suffering from psychological or environmental stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>. Two-thirds of the reported attacks involved men aged 20-30, working in low-income, stressful jobs, and facing environmental stress from summer heat waves and power cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>.

Mass hysteria cases typically spread and decline at similar exponential rates, which was observed in the rapid rise and fall of the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.

### Explaining the Injuries

While the [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] itself was an illusion, the injuries reported by victims were real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. Police investigations and medical examinations found that injuries were caused by:

*   **Animal Bites:** Rodents and stray dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.
*   **Panic-Induced Accidents:** Most scratches were from blunt objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>. People running in panic during power cuts, especially between midnight and 6 AM, would collide with objects and fall, causing injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.

### Other Contributing Factors

The Indian Rationalist Association suggested some cases were instances of "Mass Self-Delusion," where attention-seeking individuals intentionally inflicted injuries to gain media attention and establish a unique identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>.

Delhi Police also suspected that many calls were strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. They noticed that areas reporting the most [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] calls were also those with the most power cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>. People realized that reporting a [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] incident could lead to electricity restoration in their neighborhood, as authorities found that restoring power would calm the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. This led to the police's stern warning and arrests for false reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

## Similar Phenomena

The [[the_monkeyman_of_delhi | Monkey-Man]] incident is an example of a cultural phenomenon from which much can be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>. The film *Delhi 6* starring Abhishek Bachchan depicts this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>. Other notable cases of [[psychological_theories_and_identity | Mass Hysteria]] include:

*   **Spring-Heeled Jack (England, 1837-1904):** People in London believed a man in a trench coat with red eyes and metal nails scratched women, with no trace ever found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.
*   **Braid Chopping Incidents (India, 2017):** Women near Haryana and Delhi reported fainting and waking up to find their braids chopped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

These incidents often share common factors: occurrence in less educated areas, among poor families with low socio-economic status, involvement of superstitious individuals experiencing psychological and environmental stress, and the significant role of rumors and media in spreading fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

India's cultural heritage, including yoga, music, and cinema, has long contributed to its global influence and soft power. While recent claims attribute India's international recognition solely to the period after May 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, historical evidence shows that India's cultural impact and global standing were significant much earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Yoga's Global Reach

Claims suggest that Prime Minister Modi popularized Konark's Sun Temple and Yoga worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Although the United Nations proclaimed June 21st as International Yoga Day in 2014 due to PM Modi's efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, recognizing "the Universal Appeal of Yoga" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, yoga was already well-known globally.

*   **Pre-2014 Popularity**: Yoga was practiced by international figures like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2013 and his father, Pierre Trudeau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. Baba Ramdev had introduced yoga in America as early as 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   **Early Global Pioneers**: The global spread of yoga can be traced back to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who introduced the famous violinist Yehudi Menuhin to Yogacharya B.K.S. Iyengar in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. Iyengar subsequently popularized yoga worldwide, starting in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Swami Vivekananda was among the first to introduce yoga to the Western world, primarily spiritually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Other gurus like Indira Devi, K. Pattabhi Jois, and Richard Hittleman also significantly contributed to popularizing Hatha Yoga, with Hittleman performing it on American television in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Meditation and Spirituality**: Indian spirituality and meditation gained popularity in the West through figures like Swami Vivekananda, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Osho, Paramhansa Yogananda, and Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. A major influence was The Beatles, who met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1967 and learned Transcendental Meditation from him in Rishikesh in 1968, bringing significant media attention to Indian spiritual practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

## Indian Music and Cinema

India's performing arts have also played a crucial role in its soft power:

*   **Classical Music**: Pandit Ravi Shankar began giving international performances in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. He collaborated with artists like Yehudi Menuhin, winning the first Grammy award for an Indian with "West Meets East" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. He was known as the "Godfather of World Music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. Ustad Bismillah Khan also had his first international performance at the Edinburgh Festival in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   **Bollywood and Artistic Films**: Bollywood has long been popular globally, with films starring Mithun Chakraborty and Raj Kapoor enjoying immense popularity in countries like Ukraine and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. Shahrukh Khan is recognized as a global star today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. Beyond mass entertainment, filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, and Mira Nair have brought international acclaim to India at film festivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

## Broader Cultural and Intellectual Achievements

Before 2014, Indians had already achieved significant international recognition across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This includes winning:
*   Oscars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>
*   Nobel Prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>
*   Booker Prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>
*   Ramon Magsaysay Award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>
*   Olympic medals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>
*   Cricket World Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>

## Government Support and Modern Challenges to Soft Power

Past governments supported cultural and scientific institutions critical for fostering soft power. These include the establishment of:
*   Lalit Kala Academy (1954) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>
*   Sangeet Natak Academy (1952) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>
*   National School of Drama (1959) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>
*   Film Institute Pune (1960) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>
*   Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (1954) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>
*   ISRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>

However, the current [[modi_governments_impact_on_indias_cultural_and_historical_perception | Modi government's impact on India's cultural and historical perception]] is seen by some as undermining these foundations. The appointment of individuals like Gajendra Chauhan as chairman of the Film Institute Pune, despite student protests and disciplinary actions against students like Payal Kapadia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>, highlights concerns. Kapadia later won the Grand Prix at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, yet her previous struggles due to government policies are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Concerns Regarding Cultural Confidence
> There are claims by [[narendra_modis_image_and_cult_of_personality | Narendra Modi's image and cult of personality]] supporters that before 2014, Indians lacked cultural confidence and were "ashamed of themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Such statements are viewed as defaming India's rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

The removal of evolution from syllabi and the encouragement of pseudoscience are also seen as detrimental to India's soft power in science and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with earlier periods where leaders like Pandit Nehru engaged with world-renowned scientists like Albert Einstein and Vikram Sarabhai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Historical Context
> India's soft power and global standing were evident when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, as Prime Minister of a newly independent and poor nation, received esteemed welcomes globally, including from US Presidents Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy, and Soviet leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. This respect was due to his wisdom, courage, and role as an "honest mediator" in the Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>, advocating for the Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. Even Japanese author Tomio Mizokami chose to learn Hindi because of Nehru's global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>.

In the realm of sports, Indian Olympic medal-winning wrestlers had to protest for days to file an FIR against a BJP leader for alleged sexual exploitation, leading to one wrestler giving up the sport in protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. This incident reflects poorly on the [[supportive_role_of_ngos_in_indian_wrestling | supportive role of NGOs in Indian wrestling]] and the government's handling of the issue.

Despite claims of India's recent rise to global leadership by pro-government media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, critics argue that such narratives are [[false_narratives_and_media_portrayal_regarding_indias_global_leadership | false narratives and media portrayal regarding India's global leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. This can be seen in the disparity between the government's rhetoric and India's declining ranks in global indices such as the Human Development Index (134th), Global Peace Index (126th), Global Hunger Index (111th), Democracy Index (104th), and Press Freedom Index (159th in 2024, a significant drop from 2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. The use of fake photos and the circulation of misleading information on platforms like WhatsApp are also cited as undermining India's image globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

Ultimately, India's soft power has a long and rich history, built on centuries of cultural influence and decades of diplomatic efforts by various leaders. The current narrative, suggesting a sudden rise in global standing post-2014, often overlooks these deep-rooted contributions and, in some cases, current policies may even hinder rather than enhance India's cultural and intellectual standing on the world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:52:00">[29:52:00]</a>.

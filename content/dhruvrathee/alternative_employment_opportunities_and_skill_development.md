Unemployment has emerged as a significant national issue, with the India Employment Report 2024 indicating that one out of every three youths in the country is unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The unemployment rate among graduates has reached 29.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite India being the world's 5th largest economy, soon projected to be a $5 trillion economy, there is a scarcity of jobs for its youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## The Scarcity of Traditional Employment
Many large foreign and domestic companies, despite earning billions in profit, are not generating sufficient employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For instance, PepsiCo's yearly revenue in India is ₹80 billion, and Coca-Cola India's exceeds ₹128 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Yet, the youth struggle to find jobs even with a ₹12,800 salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The manufacturing sector, which had 51 million jobs in 2016, saw a decline to 36 million by 2023, a 30% reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Furthermore, jobs in the IT sector have seen layoffs, with companies like TCS, Cognizant, and Wipro not resuming campus hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Major IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCL, and Tech Mahindra reported negative hiring numbers in October 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Despite recording significant profits, these companies are not creating jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This often leads to existing employees being overworked, with India ranking highest in workplace burnout according to a McKinsey Health Institute survey in 2023, where 62% of employees report workplace exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Large corporations, even with trillions in market capitalization, employ a relatively small number of people. For example, the Adani Group, with a market capitalization of ₹11 trillion, employs only 43,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Coca-Cola's global employee count halved from 150,900 in 2012 to 82,000 in 2022, while its profit increased significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. ITC, with a market cap of ₹54 trillion, hires only around 23,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Hindustan Unilever, with an annual turnover of ₹580 billion, has only 21,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. These "white-collar" corporate jobs are extremely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

## Challenges in Formal Education and Skill Gap
The demand for higher education far outstrips the available seats. In medical education, for instance, only one out of 15 NEET UG applicants in 2023 secured a college seat, despite a severe shortage of doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Similarly, in engineering, while millions aspire to be engineers, the number of seats has been decreasing, and many remain vacant due to high fees and low quality of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Only 44.51% of faculty in engineering colleges hold PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Vacant faculty posts, even in prestigious IITs (4,500 vacant posts), contribute to poor educational quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

As a result, more than 80% of Indian engineering graduates are not employable, not due to laziness, but due to a lack of proper [[educational_infrastructure_and_opportunities | educational infrastructure]], competent faculty, and relevant skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The problem extends to Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), which have a total seating capacity of 2.5 million but also face 50% vacant seats and a lack of job guarantees for graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The total available seats in medical, engineering, and ITI fields combined are less than 5 million, while over 30 million students are eligible for higher education annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Promoting Alternative Employment Opportunities
The solution to unemployment lies in fostering alternative employment avenues, particularly in the informal sector and through local initiatives.

### The Power of Small and Micro Enterprises
The informal sector, despite contributing only 50% to the National Product, employs 90% of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. Small and micro enterprises and cooperatives, like Lijjat Papad and Amul, are significant job creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. The Indian handicraft market, with a size of ₹320 billion in 2022, employs 6.9 million people, which is 650 times more employment than large corporations like Hindustan Unilever, which has a turnover of ₹580 billion but employs only 21,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

A decentralized economy and localized production are crucial for job creation. As RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat noted, only about 30% of jobs can be created through government and private sectors combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. The idea of setting up a street food stall, as suggested by the Prime Minister, highlights the importance of such small-scale entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### The Role of Government in Fostering Alternatives
The government has a critical role in addressing unemployment:
*   **Filling Vacancies:** The central government has over 950,000 job vacancies, and state governments report over 6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Filling these posts in schools, courts, police, and ministries is a vital first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Investing in [[educational_infrastructure_and_opportunities | Education Infrastructure]]:** There is a dire need to improve existing government schools, colleges, and institutes, and to set up new ones to increase available seats, especially for aspiring engineers and doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   **Promoting Cooperatives and Small Enterprises:** The government must take large-scale action to promote cooperative and small and micro enterprises, providing not just loans but also means of production, storage space, and market mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Historical examples, such as the Great Depression in America, Mao Zedong's China, and Singapore in the 1960s, demonstrate that government intervention is crucial for job creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's establishment of public sector undertakings and nationalization of banks, as well as the White Revolution, were key examples of government-led job creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

## Individual Initiative and [[Employment and Skill Development Initiatives | Skill Development]]
Individuals should not solely rely on government action. They can take proactive steps to improve their employability and create opportunities:
1.  **Eliminate Distractions:** Delete betting and gambling apps that waste money and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
2.  **Learn a Skill:** Acquire practical skills. This could involve learning to cook from YouTube and starting a cloud kitchen, making tiffins or birthday cakes, or setting up a stall for fritters or tea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
3.  **Gain Experience:** Work with experienced individuals, such as at a jewellery shop to learn design or with a handicraft worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
4.  **Embrace Sincerity:** No work is insignificant if done with sincerity and dedication, which can lead to the confidence to start one's own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
5.  **Utilize Learning Resources:** Explore online courses for skills like filmmaking, video editing, research, scripting, or AI-related skills such as ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. Even if the initial pay is low, it should be treated as an internship to gain valuable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

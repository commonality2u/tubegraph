From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

Dhruv Rathee presents a detailed vision of what he would do if he were the Prime Minister of India. While stating he currently has no desire to enter politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, he emphasizes the importance of dreaming about and discussing how to make the country a better place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His approach is structured around the oath of allegiance to the Indian Constitution, promising to do right to all people "without fear or favour, affection or ill-will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Foundation: Peace and Prosperity

The core of Dhruv Rathee's vision is encapsulated by the phrase "Peace and Prosperity," asserting that true prosperity cannot be achieved without peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Peace, in this context, extends to safety, which he views as the fundamental basis for any country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Identifying Problems: Safety and Security Issues

Rathee begins by diagnosing various safety and security challenges facing India, which he considers the crucial first step to finding solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>:

*   **Border Security**
    *   The need for defense forces to effectively combat infiltration and external aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Terrorist Attacks**
    *   Concerns over persistent terrorist activities, citing incidents such as the 2001 Parliament attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, 2008 Mumbai attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, 2019 Pulwama attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, 2023 Jaipur-Mumbai Express attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, and recent attacks in Reasi, Doda, and Kathua <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   The Home Ministry reported 761 terrorist attacks in Jammu & Kashmir over five years, resulting in 174 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Riots and Communal Clashes**
    *   Addressing conflicts stemming from religious or ethnic differences, exemplified by the 2020 Delhi riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data indicated over 2,900 cases of communal and religious rioting between 2017 and 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   The Manipur conflict led to over 219 deaths, 10,000 FIRs, and 60,000 displaced people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Lynchings**
    *   Incidents occurring due to religious motives or WhatsApp-spread rumors (e.g., Kasganj, Pehlu Khan, Tabrez Ansari, Akhlaq, Palgarh, Mohammad Azam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Crime**
    *   High rates of murder, with 28,522 cases registered in 2022 (averaging 78 daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Prevalence of hit-and-run and road rage cases; in 2022, India saw 67,387 hit-and-run incidents, leading to 30,486 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Accidents**
    *   Deaths in building collapses (1,177 in 2.5 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   Fatalities from open pits and manholes (at least 2 daily, 5,393 between 2015-2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   Railway accidents, despite a decreasing trend, remain a concern; 2,590 people died on Mumbai Suburban Railway tracks in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   Collapsing infrastructure, such as the 2022 Morbi Bridge Collapse that killed 135 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, and illegal hoardings (e.g., 16 deaths in Mumbai) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   Deaths due to substandard medicines (e.g., 12 children dying from toxic cough syrup in Jammu in 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Vision for Safety and Equality

Dhruv Rathee expresses concern over the low value placed on the lives of common people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. His government would strive to ensure that the life of every citizen, regardless of their socio-economic status, is valued equally to that of the Prime Minister or a billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This aligns with Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees the Right to Equality and equal protection under the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

He emphasizes that the first step to solving problems is diagnosing them, followed by acceptance, and then taking action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. He criticizes politicians for ignoring the first two steps, often sweeping problems under the carpet or suppressing reporting on issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. An example of suppression is the alleged imprisonment of a journalist reporting on the Ankita Bhandari murder case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

As Prime Minister, he would encourage open reporting by the media on safety issues and crime, pledging protection for journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions: Preventive and Punitive

Rathee outlines two categories of solutions:

1.  **Preventive Solutions:** Steps taken to stop a problem from occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
2.  **Punitive Solutions:** Actions taken to fight existing problems and punish perpetrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Examples of Solutions:

*   **FIR Registration:** If a local police station refuses to file an FIR, citizens should be able to approach the Superintendent of Police (SP) office, with a departmental inquiry initiated against the non-compliant officer. This system was implemented by the Rajasthan government in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy and Defence:**
    *   Implement an effective foreign policy and build good relations with neighboring countries to prevent border clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   Ensure the Indian Armed Forces are well-equipped with modern weapons and technology, through both imports and increased domestic manufacturing, and boost defence research and development budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
    *   Conduct regular inspections to prevent accidents caused by malfunctioning equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Mental Health for Soldiers:**
    *   Prioritize the mental health of soldiers to reduce suicides (819 personnel died from suicide in the last 5 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
    *   Hire 1,800 mental health practitioners (clinical psychiatrists, behavioral health specialists, social workers) for the 1.2 million active army personnel, following a US Army ratio of 1:700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This would save lives and create government jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
    *   Expand this scheme to paramilitary forces, intelligence agencies, and police across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Education Budget:**
    *   Increase the education budget by 3 to 4 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
    *   Funding sources: Reverting corporate tax to 2017-18 levels (to recover ₹1 trillion loss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a> and reallocating funds from highway construction (₹2 trillion spent, benefiting only 8% car owners, while 50% use cycles/bikes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
    *   Advocate for cities designed for humans, not just cars, to reduce pollution and urban heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Ending Corruption:**
    *   Combat corruption at all levels, especially in safety and security sectors, where it leads to tragedies like illegal hoardings and adulterated medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
    *   Address the "top-down approach" of corruption, asserting that the purity of intention from the Prime Minister or Chief Minister is crucial to break the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
    *   Tackle overworked and underpaid police and government employees by doubling police personnel and increasing the number of judges and courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
    *   Implement strict laws and harsh punishments for greed-driven corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.
*   **Police Reforms:**
    *   Create state-level investigating agencies similar to the CBI, ensuring proper investigation for all cases, not just those gaining media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
    *   Provide police officers and government officials with good salaries, mental healthcare, insurance, family benefits, and strictly limit work to 8 hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
    *   Fill all vacancies to manage workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
    *   Instruct police to address every citizen as "Sir or Ma'am" to foster respect and change mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **Gender Sensitization:**
    *   Address the root cause of crimes like sexual harassment by changing mindsets that objectify women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
    *   While respecting freedom of expression (e.g., not banning films like Animal or songs by Honey Singh/Badshah) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, he would encourage artists to remove misogyny and objectification from their content and promote good content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
    *   Introduce gender sensitization classes in schools to instill the right mindset from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **Illegal Weapons:**
    *   Implement an "Amnesty Period" for illegal weapons, similar to Australia and Serbia, allowing citizens to surrender them without penalty to reduce their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. Serbia collected over 1 million illegal weapons within a month using this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

## A Peaceful and Prosperous India

Dhruv Rathee believes these solutions, though seemingly impractical, are tried-and-tested and can transform India into a safe and secure nation for both citizens and foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. He draws inspiration from Singapore, which rose from poverty and ethnic clashes in the 1960s to become the 5th most peaceful country globally by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. His ultimate goal is for India to become the world's most peaceful and prosperous country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

He indicates that this video focuses primarily on safety and security, and if there is public interest, he can create a series addressing other issues like unemployment, inflation, poverty, wealth inequality, loneliness, pollution, [[climate_change_and_its_impacts_on_india | climate change]], and biodiversity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

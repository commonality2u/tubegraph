On November 12, 1996, at 3:55 PM, the city of Charkhi Dadri, around 100 km from Delhi, witnessed India's first and only mid-air collision, which became the country's worst air disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This catastrophic event involved a chartered Kazakhstan Airlines aircraft, which had taken off from Shymkent, Kazakhstan, and was flying towards New Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Simultaneously, a Saudi Airlines flight was preparing for departure from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Air Traffic Controller (ATC) VK Dutta was on duty, guiding both planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. He cleared the Saudi flight to take off and reach 10,000 ft, then later permitted it to climb to 14,000 ft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Concurrently, he instructed the Kazakh plane, which sought to land, to remain at 15,000 ft to maintain the necessary 1,000 ft vertical separation from the Saudi aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Dutta observed the two blinking dots on his radar screen getting closer until they fused into one and disappeared, signaling a terrible accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Residents of Charkhi Dadri reported seeing a flash of light and hearing thunder, followed by falling debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Understanding the Collision's Causes: The Swiss Cheese Model

The [[investigation_of_airplane_accidents | investigation]] into the Charkhi Dadri disaster highlighted multiple contributing factors, aligning with the "Swiss Cheese Model" of accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This model posits that accidents are rarely due to a single reason but rather a series of small mistakes or "holes" in safety barriers that align at a critical moment, leading to a major disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. If even one "hole" were not aligned, the accident might have been prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Key issues identified included:
*   **Misunderstanding of Instructions**: Flight data recorders from the black boxes revealed the Saudi plane maintained 14,000 ft, meaning the Kazakh plane descended from its assigned 15,000 ft altitude to 14,000 ft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Audio recordings showed the Kazakh pilots were distracted and did not properly understand the ATC's instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Language Barrier**: The Kazakh pilots struggled with English; a radio operator was required to translate ATC messages from English to Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The accident report concluded that the ATC instruction was "subjected to an error of understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Technology**: In the 1990s, ATCs primarily relied on older primary radar, which could only provide approximate horizontal distances, not altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Altitude information had to be constantly communicated and manually charted by ATCs, making their job highly stressful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Single Air Corridor**: Delhi Airport at the time had only one air corridor for both incoming and departing planes, significantly increasing the risk of collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Post-1996 Aviation Safety Improvements

The Charkhi Dadri accident served as a critical learning experience for the Indian government and global aviation experts, leading to significant changes in [[aviation_safety_procedures_and_regulations | aviation safety procedures and regulations]] to prevent similar incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Fortunately, no mid-air collision has occurred in India since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### Separated Air Corridors

One of the direct outcomes was the implementation of separated air corridors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Now, there are distinct paths for incoming and departing aircraft, drastically reducing the chance of head-on or converging traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Mandatory [[introduction_of_traffic_collision_avoidance_system_tcas | TCAS]] Installation

Although the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had recommended the installation of secondary radars for years, it was only after the Charkhi Dadri accident that action was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Five months after the incident, Civil Aviation Minister CM Ibrahim announced that all 30+ seater aircraft in India must be fitted with the [[introduction_of_traffic_collision_avoidance_system_tcas | Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)]] by December 31, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

[[introduction_of_traffic_collision_avoidance_system_tcas | TCAS]] is a crucial system that:
*   Activates an alarm in the cockpit if another aircraft comes within 1,000 ft of vertical distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   Provides the pilot with instructions on the required evasive maneuver (e.g., fly upwards or downwards) to maintain safe separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

This was a significant step for India, as [[introduction_of_traffic_collision_avoidance_system_tcas | TCAS]] technology was very expensive at the time, and many countries initially resisted its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. However, India's stance eventually led other countries to adopt the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### English Language Proficiency for Pilots and ATCs

The accident also highlighted severe [[communication_challenges_in_international_aviation | communication challenges in international aviation]], particularly the potential for misunderstanding between ATCs and pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. In 1998, India brought this issue before the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. It was proposed that all pilots achieve a minimum level of English proficiency for international flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Despite debates due to English not being the primary language in many countries, it was eventually chosen as the international standard for aviation communication to prevent miscommunications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Today, proficiency in English is mandatory for any pilot flying internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

These combined efforts, effectively "filling up every possible hole in the Swiss Cheese model," have been instrumental in preventing further mid-air collisions in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. While other types of plane crashes still occur for different reasons, the risk of mid-air collisions has been significantly mitigated through these safety enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

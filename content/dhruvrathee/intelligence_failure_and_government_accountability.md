## The Pahalgam Terrorist Attack (2025)

On an unspecified date in 2025, a horrific terrorist attack occurred in the Baisaran Valley of Pahalgam, known as "India's mini Switzerland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. At least 26 people, primarily males, lost their lives, and 17 were injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The victims included tourists from various places, an IAF Corporal, an Intelligence Bureau Section Officer, and a newlywed Indian Navy Lieutenant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The attack targeted people based on their religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. One victim was a Muslim mule handler, one was Christian, and the remaining 24 were Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Eyewitness accounts detail terrorists asking victims to recite Islamic verses and shooting those who could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For about 20 minutes, there was no police or army presence, with locals using mules to transport the injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The Indian Army arrived later to rescue survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

The Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba's shadow group, The Resistant Front (TRF), claimed responsibility for the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. TRF was declared a terrorist organization by the Ministry of Home Affairs two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Intelligence assessments suspect Lashkar-e-Taiba commander Saifullah Kasuri as a conspirator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Sketches of three Pakistani attackers were released by J&K police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Government sources also suggested two Kashmiri youths, who had gone to Pakistan in 2018, might have been among the terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Questions of [[government_regulatory_failures | Intelligence Failure]] and [[systemic_issues_in_law_enforcement_and_governance | Government Accountability]]

### Prior Intelligence and Lack of Action

Despite claims of "no [[government_regulatory_failures | intelligence failure]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, sources reported prior inputs about terrorists scoping hotels in the first week of April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This raises serious questions about why the attack occurred despite warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Parallels to the Pulwama Attack (2019)

The situation in Pahalgam draws parallels to the 2019 Pulwama attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>:
*   **Official Stance:** In June 2019, the Ministry of State for Home Affairs, G Kishan Reddy, stated there was no [[government_regulatory_failures | intelligence failure]] in Pulwama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Investigative Findings:** A Frontline investigation revealed 11 intelligence inputs between January 2 and February 13, 2019, warning of a 'Qisas' (revenge) attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Specific Warnings:**
    *   Mudasir Ahmad Khan, the mastermind, was known and wanted for a 2017 CRPF camp attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   An input from January 24, 2019, reported Mudasir Ahmad Khan planning a 'Fidayeen' attack and his contact with the Shahid Baba Group, which included the Pulwama bomber Adil Ahmad Dar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   A January 25 input pinpointed Mudasir Khan's location with foreign mercenaries in Midoora and Lam Tral villages, warning of an attack in Awantipora or Pampore, only 16-17 km from Pulwama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   A "Top Secret, Matter Most Urgent" input from February 12 warned of IED blasts on J&K security forces' routes, with a video demonstrating IEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
    *   A final warning was issued on February 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Operational Decisions:** Despite these detailed warnings, over 2,500 soldiers were refused airlifts and sent in a single convoy, a decision later criticized by the former IG of CRPF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The speaker questions how the Pulwama attack happened despite such detailed intelligence inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Government Responsibility and Negligence

The security of the country is the responsibility of the elected government, and questions regarding failures must be directed at them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Unfulfilled Promises and Continued Attacks
In December 2016, Prime Minister Modi claimed demonetisation had "broken the back of terrorism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. However, numerous terrorist attacks have occurred in Jammu and Kashmir since then, including:
*   Nagrota Army Base attack (November 2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
*   Amarnath Yatra attack (July 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
*   Sunjuwan Military Station attack (February 2018) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   Pulwama attack (February 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   Jammu Bus Stand grenade blast (March 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
*   Awantipora Paramilitary Police attack (June 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>
*   Poonch Rajouri attack (2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>
*   Reasi attack (2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   Pahalgam attack (2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>

### Media's Role and Lack of Scrutiny
The speaker criticizes the country's media for lacking the courage to question the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Unlike before 2014, when media and films (like *A Wednesday*) questioned the government on terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, pro-government anchors now deflect blame. Arnab Goswami, for instance, held the Supreme Court responsible for the Pahalgam attack instead of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, despite his past WhatsApp chat celebrating being first to cover the Pulwama attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. A correspondent from Aaj Tak was cut off for questioning the lack of security at the Pahalgam picnic spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Decline in [[transparency_and_accountability_in_political_funding | Accountability]]
Historically, politicians resigned after major attacks, accepting their mistakes, as seen with Home Minister Shivraj Patil and Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh after the 26/11 Mumbai attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This "basic thing" has been lost in "New India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Shortage in Security Forces
The Defence Ministry reported a shortage of over 8,400 army officers and 92,400 soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, leading to soldiers being shifted frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This shortage is attributed to no army recruitment during two years of COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Furthermore, there are plans to cut army strength by 200,000 over three years to reduce salary and pension expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, which many allege is the government saving money on military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. A victim's sister stated that her brother could have been saved if the army had been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

The speaker also highlights the overworked police in various states and calls for doubling police personnel and improving training for better law and order and citizen security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Prioritizing VIP Security
While common citizens are killed due to lack of security, VIPs like Mukesh Ambani and Bollywood celebrities receive Z-plus and Y-plus security covers, funded by taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The speaker questions why the lives of common people are considered "cheap" compared to VIPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

### [[Preventive and punitive solutions for national security | Lack of Preventive Solutions]]
Home Minister Amit Shah stated that those behind the Pahalgam attack would not be spared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. However, the speaker asks if the government has any solutions to prevent future attacks or provide assurance to common citizens, as opposed to giving assurance to celebrities like Salman Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Political Exploitation of Tragedy

Local Kashmiris observed a shutdown and candlelight marches as a sign of mourning and unity after the Pahalgam attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Muslim organizations like Jamat-Ulama-e-Hind and the All India Imam Organisation condemned the attack, with calls for strong anti-terror messages from mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Many Muslim countries also condemned the attack, and Indian Muslims expressed opposition to terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

Despite calls for unity against terrorism's goal of spreading religious hatred and breaking apart the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, the speaker criticizes the BJP for exploiting the tragedy. The official Twitter and Instagram handles of BJP Chhattisgarh posted a Ghibili-style image with the caption, "They asked for the religion not the caste," "We'll remember" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This post is seen as using tragedy for political benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a> and continuing to spread religious hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

The speaker argues that the BJP's agenda aligns with that of terrorists in trying to divide the country along religious lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. They aim to create fear among Hindus about Muslims and among Muslims about Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, primarily to secure votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. This perpetuates a narrative of Hindus being in "perpetual danger" since 2014, unlike before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The speaker urges citizens to criticize every act of violence, regardless of its basis, and to stand united as Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

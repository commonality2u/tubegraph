On 12th November 1996, at 03:55 PM, a catastrophic mid-air collision occurred near Charkhi Dadri, India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This incident involved a chartered Kazakhstan Airlines aircraft and a Saudi Airlines flight, resulting in India's first and only mid-air collision, and the worst air disaster in the country's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Collision

The Kazakhstan Airlines aircraft had taken off from Shymkent in Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> and was flying towards New Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. On board were several small traders from Kyrgyzstan, en route to India to purchase wool for resale in Central Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Simultaneously, a Saudi Airlines flight was preparing for takeoff from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This flight carried 312 passengers, including 231 Indian blue-collar, construction, and domestic workers traveling to Saudi Arabia for employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Air Traffic Controller (ATC) VK Dutta was on duty that evening, guiding both planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He cleared the Saudi Arabian flight for takeoff from Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Minutes later, the Saudi pilots reported reaching 10,000 ft and requested clearance to ascend to 14,000 ft, which Dutta granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Meanwhile, the Kazakh aircraft wished to land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Dutta instructed the Kazakh plane to remain at 15,000 ft and not descend further, maintaining the required 1,000 ft vertical separation from the Saudi aircraft flying at 14,000 ft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

On his radar screen, Dutta observed the two aircraft as blinking dots converging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. In a few minutes, the dots fused into one and then disappeared, indicating a terrible event had occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath

About 100 km from Delhi, in the small city of Charkhi Dadri, residents witnessed a bright flash of light followed by thunder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Soon after, iron debris began falling from the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Both planes had crashed into each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Initial investigations included preparing 70 funeral pyres for Hindu cremations and burying Muslim victims in a mass grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Investigators began examining the flight recorders, or "black boxes," from both aircraft to understand the moments before the crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. A judicial inquiry was ordered by Prime Minister Mr. Deve Gowda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Experts noted that Delhi's primary radar system at the time was "fairly old" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Understanding Air Traffic Control

To comprehend the disaster, it's essential to understand basic aviation rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>:
*   **Airways**: Like roads, the sky has set paths for aeroplanes, known as Airways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Air Corridors**: Airways are divided into air corridors, similar to traffic lanes, to prevent accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Flight Level**: The height at which planes fly is called the flight level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Separation Standards**: The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards require a minimum vertical separation of 1,000 ft and a 14 km radius for safety between aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) are responsible for ensuring aircraft follow these rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. They monitor planes' position, speed, and altitude from the ground, seeing them as blinking dots on their screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Radar Technology in the 1990s

ATCs primarily obtain flight information from radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Radars use radio waves to detect distant objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. For aviation, radars are classified into two types:
*   **Primary Radar**: Emits radio waves that reflect off aircraft to calculate horizontal distance, but not altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Secondary Radar**: A newer technology where an aircraft's transponder receives signals from primary antennas and responds with its own signal, providing more reliable information, including vertical distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

During the 1990s, when the Charkhi Dadri incident occurred, secondary radar was not widely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. ATCs relied solely on less reliable primary radar data and constant communication with pilots to manually chart flight paths, a tedious and stressful job in busy airports like Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. ATCs in the 1990s were considered to have one of the most stressful jobs in the world, even more than doctors or racecar drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Causes of the Disaster: The Swiss Cheese Model

Accidents are rarely due to a single cause; rather, they result from a series of small mistakes or failures aligning at the wrong time, as illustrated by the Swiss Cheese Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. If even one of these "holes" (mistakes) doesn't align, a disaster might be prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The Charkhi Dadri collision was a culmination of such errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Contributing Factors:
1.  **Kazakhstan Aircraft's Descent**: Initially, Indian officials suspected the Saudi plane had deviated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, black box flight data revealed the Saudi plane was at 14,000 ft, and the collision occurred at that altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This meant the Kazakh plane had descended from its assigned 15,000 ft to 14,000 ft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
2.  **Communication Breakdown and Language Barrier**: Audio recordings from the Kazakh black box showed pilots were distracted, complaining about Delhi traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Crucially, they did not understand English properly, relying on a radio operator for translation from English to Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The accident report concluded that the ATC's instruction was misunderstood, or thought to be for another flight, leading to their unauthorized descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The reputation of post-Soviet Union airlines, including Russian ones, was poor, with anecdotal issues like pilots giving controls to children or drinking before landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
3.  **Single Air Corridor**: In the 1990s, Delhi airport operated with only one air corridor for both departing and incoming aircraft, increasing collision risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
4.  **Reliance on Primary Radar**: The absence of secondary radar meant ATCs relied heavily on pilot communication for altitude information, making the system less robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Systemic Changes

The Charkhi Dadri disaster served as a profound lesson for the Indian government and global aviation experts, leading to significant changes to prevent future accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Fortunately, no mid-air collision has occurred in India since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Key improvements include:
1.  **Separated Air Corridors**: There are now distinct air corridors for incoming and departing planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
2.  **Mandatory TCAS Installation**: Although the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had recommended secondary radar installation for years, the government had not acted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Five months after the Charkhi Dadri accident, Civil Aviation Minister CM Ibrahim announced in the Lok Sabha that all 30+ seater aircraft in India must be fitted with the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) by 31st December 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. TCAS is a system that alerts pilots if another aircraft gets within 1,000 ft vertically and advises on the necessary directional adjustment to maintain separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Despite the high cost of TCAS technology at the time, India's mandatory implementation set a precedent, eventually leading other countries to adopt the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
3.  **English Proficiency Standards**: India raised the issue of language barriers and potential misunderstandings between ATCs and pilots at the ICAO in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. After extensive debate, English was eventually chosen as the mandatory international language for pilots flying internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

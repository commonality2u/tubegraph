Bollywood is currently facing a significant problem of financial inequality and inflated actor fees, a bitter truth that, despite recent box office successes, suggests the industry is "slowly killing itself" and has "lost its soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This issue is deeply intertwined with the increasing [[impact_of_corporatisation_on_bollywood_cinema | corporatisation]] of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Disparities in Earnings

Despite 2023 being the best year for the Indian box office, with approximately 1,000 films released earning a total of ₹122.26 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, a significant portion of this income is concentrated at the top. A staggering 40% of the total earnings in 2023 came from only the top 1% of films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. This concentration of wealth makes it extremely difficult for [[challenges_faced_by_independent_and_smallbudget_films | small and medium-budget films]] with no well-known actors to be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. In 2023, only about five small or medium-budget films managed to earn a significant profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

Many films that chased the "hit formula" for mass appeal still ended up as commercial failures, demonstrating the unsustainability of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Notable examples include:
*   *Adipurush* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>
*   Tiger Shroff's *Ganapath*, which earned only ₹100 million on a budget of ₹2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>
*   Kartik Aryan's *Shehzada* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>
*   Akshay Kumar and Emraan Hashmi's *Selfie*, which earned ₹240 million on a budget of ₹1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>
*   Kangana Ranaut's *Tejas*, earning ₹60 million on a budget of ₹700 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>
*   John Abraham's *Vedaa* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>
*   Akshay Kumar's *Sarfira* and *Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. The latter, despite a budget of ₹3.5 billion and featuring extensive action and sets, earned only ₹1.02 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

## The Burden of Inflated Superstar Fees

One of the primary reasons for financial woes is the inflated fees charged by Bollywood superstars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. Often, half of a film's budget is consumed by the fees of a single lead actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.
*   For instance, in Akshay Kumar's film *Khel Khel Mein*, out of a ₹1 billion budget, ₹600 million was paid to Akshay Kumar alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. This left negligible funds for other actors and crucial aspects like story, direction, screenplay, and dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. The film ultimately earned only ₹570 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
*   Lead actors in both Hindi and South Indian films are reportedly charging between ₹1 billion to ₹2 billion for a single film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
*   Kriti Sanon received ₹30 million for *Adipurush*, while Prabhas was paid ₹1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Such massive payments to one actor severely limit the budget available for CGI and VFX, making it difficult for Bollywood to compete with international films like *Avengers* or *Avatar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

This phenomenon is attributed to the "greed" of both the actors, who might engage in surrogate ads and promote gambling for additional income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>, and the film studios themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Studios are willing to pay exorbitant fees in the hope of generating ₹5 billion in returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. Producers prioritize "short-term quick gains" over long-term sustainable business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

Trade analyst Komal Nahta laments that "no one is thinking about the industry at large" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. Actors focus on their bank balance, and producers on viewership, with a general lack of care for the industry itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

## Impact on Quality and Diversity

The reliance on superstars and the "hit formula" has led to a significant decline in creativity and originality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The formula includes:
*   Avoiding anything new, sticking to what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   Making action films with violence, sequels, and remakes of super hit films or old songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   Casting superstars and actors with "good face value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
*   Copying Hollywood films' stories, scenes, and scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   Avoiding thought-provoking content or showing society a mirror, instead appeasing popular mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   Keeping scenes fast-paced due to decreased attention spans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   Emphasizing "larger than life" elements: big stars, sets, locations, budgets, and VFX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   Spending heavily on marketing to generate buzz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

While this formula generates "Blockbusters" and breaks records, the resulting films are often not memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Films that are heartfelt, thought-provoking, and re-watchable are disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Recent top-grossing films like *Jawan* and *Pathaan*, despite commercial success, are considered "mediocre" in terms of filmmaking, screenplay, acting, and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

Comparing recent blockbusters by stars like Shahrukh Khan (*Pathaan*, *Jawan*, *Dilwale*, *Happy New Year*) and Salman Khan (*Tiger 3*, *Tiger Zinda Hai*, *Kick*) to their classic films (*Dilwale Dulhaniyan Le Jayenge*, *Kuch Kuch Hota Hai*, *Maine Pyar Kiya*, *Hum Aapke Hain Kaun*) highlights a "clear-cut divide" in quality and substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Films adjusted for inflation, such as *Mughal-e-Azam*, *Sholay*, and *Mother India*, demonstrate that quality, emotion, and proper storytelling can indeed lead to lasting success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

The industry has seen a significant decline in genre diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. Instead of a variety of horror, animated, superhero, or alien-themed films, Bollywood now predominantly produces melodramatic action, comedy, or patriotic films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>. There is also a notable absence of films for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. This loss of variety means that "Bollywood is losing its soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>.

## Challenges for Small-Budget Films

The prevailing system of "big budgets, big actors, big sets, big films, expensive tickets, and expensive popcorn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a> makes it nearly impossible for [[challenges_faced_by_independent_and_smallbudget_films | small-budget films]] to achieve success.
*   Films like *Bheja Fry* (made on ₹5.4 million, earned ₹125 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>, *Kahaani* (made on ₹80 million, earned ₹1.04 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>, or *Badhaai Ho* (made on ₹290 million, earned ₹2.19 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>, which succeeded through word-of-mouth publicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>, are becoming increasingly rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
*   Independent films face systemic sidelining and difficulty securing theatrical releases or prime time slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>. They often do not even get a full week in cinemas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>, preventing word-of-mouth publicity that once allowed classics like *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge* to build momentum over weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>.
*   Award-winning films, such as *All That Breathes* or a film on freedom fighter Khudiram Bose, have struggled to get theatrical releases in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.
*   High movie ticket prices, which have turned cinema-going from a weekly middle-class activity into a rare "picnic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>, further alienate a broader audience.
*   Many films that do not get a proper theatrical run are labelled as "OTT films" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>. However, OTT platforms now often demand to see box office performance before acquiring films, creating a Catch-22 situation for smaller productions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>.

This "monopoly" arising from the greed of film studios is perceived as sinking the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>. Siddharth Roy Kapur, founder of Roy Kapur Films, states that without small-budget films, the industry will not be sustainable in the future and will lack the necessary workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

## A Path Forward

To address these issues, Bollywood's entire ecosystem needs to become more inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. This means actively supporting low-budget films from production to release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>.
*   A lower budget per film allows more films to be made, creating more jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.
*   Cheaper tickets, a direct result of lower production costs, would expand the audience, making cinema accessible to a wider demographic, including the poor and middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.
*   Even superstar production houses could contribute by supporting content-driven, small-budget films, as exemplified by Aamir Khan's production of *Laapataa Ladies* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>.

The hope is that Bollywood will return to creating "content-driven, unique, meaningful films with good music, songs, and acting," as this is seen as the only way to save the Hindi film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.

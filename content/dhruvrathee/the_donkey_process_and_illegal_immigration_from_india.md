The "donkey process," or "donkey flight," refers to the backdoor, illegal entry into a country without a legal visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This term was initially associated with individuals illegally entering the UK, but it has since evolved to encompass various backdoor entries, with a significant shift towards entering the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Case Study: The Patel Family Tragedy

Dingucha, a village in Gujarat, India, has a population of about 3,000, but over half of its houses are vacant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Approximately 1,800 villagers have left the country in pursuit of better opportunities abroad, driven by a lack of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

In January 2022, Jagdish Patel, a 39-year-old former teacher who earned a modest monthly income of ₹9,000 - ₹10,000 from a garment business, decided to follow his fellow villagers to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Driven by poverty and unemployment, he and his family, including his wife Vaishali Ben and their two children, raised ₹6.5 million to engage an agent for their journey to America via the 'donkey process' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Vaishali Ben dreamt of working at a beauty salon, and Jagdish wanted to provide his children with better education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

On January 12, the Patel family flew to Toronto, Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The 'donkey process' involved their agent dropping them near the US-Canada border, where they were expected to walk the remaining distance and illegally cross into the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Tragically, within a week of arriving in Toronto, the family's lifeless bodies were found by police just 12 meters from the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. They succumbed to the freezing weather, which plunged to -35°C, a harsh reality they were likely unaware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

The Patel family's story is not isolated; thousands of Indians attempt to illegally immigrate to countries like the US and UK each year using this process, with numerous individuals losing their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## The Donkey Process Explained

The 'donkey process' facilitates backdoor illegal entry into countries without legal visas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Evolution and Routes
Initially, the term 'donkey process' was primarily associated with illegal entry into the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Many Indians would first travel to the Schengen zone of Europe, a 27-country area requiring only a Schengen visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. From Europe, despite the UK not being part of the Schengen zone, its proximity allowed individuals to reach the UK via various routes, including trucks, cars, or extended walks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Even a decade ago, approximately 150 Indians were deported from the UK monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

Today, the 'donkey process' has shifted, with a preference towards entering the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. The routes include:
*   **Canada-US Border**: As seen with the Patel family, this involves flying to Canada and then attempting to cross the northern US border on foot, where temperatures can plummet to -35°C to -40°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
*   **South America-Mexico-US Border**: This route is considered even more dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. It typically starts in Ecuador or Brazil, where visas are easier for Indians to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. The journey involves thousands of kilometers through Colombia and Panama to Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

### Dangers of the Routes
The US-Mexico border is considered the world's most dangerous border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. A significant peril on the South America-Mexico route is the **Darien Gap**, a dense, over 100-kilometer-wide jungle with no roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. This area, known for mountains, forests, and rivers, lacks government authority and is frequented by drug cartels and guerrilla groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. Tragically, individuals often fall victim to gang violence, with "donkers" (agents transporting individuals) sometimes killing travelers if payments are not made in full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. After surviving the jungle, migrants face Mexico's scorching desert and an imposing border wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. In 2021 alone, over 650 people died attempting to cross the US-Mexico border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

### Role of Visa Agencies and Agents
In India, numerous visa agencies and companies, whose agents are sometimes called "donkers," facilitate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Gujarat and Punjab are primary exporters of illegal immigrants, with Haryana also joining due to rising unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

These agencies offer various "packages," from deluxe options including forged documents and travel assistance, to economical ones where individuals are dropped near the border to complete the journey on foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Charges range from ₹2.5 million to ₹6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Many individuals are either unaware that regular visa fees are not this high, or they fail to meet the requirements for a legal visa, feeling they have no other alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. To fund these exorbitant fees, people often sell their farms, homes, or deplete their life savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

These agencies often mislead people with false promises of smooth journeys and abundant job opportunities, concealing the real challenges and legal hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. This exploitation of an [[role_of_visa_agencies_in_illegal_immigration | information gap]] makes it easy to trap unsuspecting individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Illegal Immigration

Despite the perilous nature of the "donkey process" and the millions of rupees invested, three main reasons drive individuals to risk their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>:

### 1. Pursuit of Economic Opportunities
The predominant reason is the [[economic_motivation_behind_illegal_immigration | pursuit of economic opportunities]] and a better life, often inspired by the "American Dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. While the upper and upper-middle classes might share similar aspirations, they typically have access to legal means like skilled job applications or foreign university qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. However, the lower-middle class often lacks the financial resources or qualifications for legal immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

Success stories, like that of Mitesh Trivedi, an engineer who left India 30 years ago due to career stagnation and now owns a profitable restaurant in Canada, generate hope and motivate others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. This can also create societal or family pressure, where having a family member settle abroad becomes a matter of reputation in the village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

### 2. Rising Unemployment
Rising unemployment in India is another significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. Haryana, in particular, has seen many people resort to this path in recent years, holding the highest unemployment rate in India at 37.3% as of September 2022, four times the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. This rate is especially prevalent in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>. Faced with dire conditions, individuals view this life-threatening path as a better alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. Thousands sell family land and gold to fund these risky endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. Villages in Jind district, Haryana, like Dhatrath, Morkhi, and Kalwa, have become hubs for those seeking the 'donkey process' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.

An alternative route through Dubai involves staying in shady hotels and traveling in secret containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. Nishchay Sharma, a young man from Haryana with a weak educational background, opted for the "Donkey Flight" and reached California after traveling through nine countries, navigating jungles and extreme weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. This journey can take up to two years, with many being brutalized, imprisoned, or losing their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. Haryanvi youth express frustration with the toxic cycle of joblessness and instances of paper leaks in entrance exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.

### 3. Political Persecution and Asylum Seeking
The third reason is escaping political persecution, oppression, or discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>. This is technically the most commonly reported reason for individuals surrendering to Border Patrol after crossing illegally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.

## The Asylum Process

Most individuals undertaking the "donkey route" willingly surrender to Border Patrol upon crossing into the US to seek asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. Asylum, as defined by the United Nations Refugee Agency, is a form of protection where a country agrees to protect an individual acknowledging they face danger in their home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. This danger can be political (threat of harm or death due to political beliefs), religious, racial, ethnic/regional identity, caste-based, or due to social group persecution (e.g., women or the LGBT+ community) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.

To receive asylum in America, one must be physically present on American soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. Applicants must present their case in immigration court, providing justification and reasoning, and prove their claims are genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. However, many may lie about their true reasons, such as [[economic_motivation_behind_illegal_immigration | economic motivation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. Lying can lead to deportation and a ban on future legal travel to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

Some individuals genuinely face these circumstances. For example, Jashanpreet Singh from Jalandhar, an openly gay man, faced daily discrimination, harassment, and physical attacks in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. Fearing for his life and due to India's cultural views on LGBT+ issues, he took the 'donkey route' through Turkey and France to reach the Mexican border, where he entered America and was granted asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. Such cases highlight the [[challenges_faced_by_indian_immigrants_seeking_asylum | challenges faced by Indian immigrants seeking asylum]].

The asylum process can take months or years of investigation, including potential mistreatment or torture, with a risk of deportation even after years of living in America if claims are found to be false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>. Upon crossing the border, individuals are typically placed in detention centers with terrible conditions, where many people are confined in small rooms for weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>.

## Statistics on Illegal Immigration from India

The number of Indians attempting illegal entry into the US has increased significantly year-on-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
*   In 2013, the number was negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.
*   In 2020-21, over 30,000 Indians attempted this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.
*   In 2021-22, the number doubled to 63,927 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.
*   Between October 2022 and September 2023, this escalated to 96,000, with nearly 100,000 Indians attempting to enter the US illegally in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. Of these, 30,000 were caught near Canada and 41,000 near Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.

While the number of Mexicans attempting this is higher due to shared borders, India tops the list among Asian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. In 2015, approximately 450,000 Indians were found undocumented in America, slightly higher than China's 400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Life is invaluable, and choosing such risky paths by putting one's life at stake is not worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. Individuals seeking information on legal immigration processes, visa requirements, and travel expenses can utilize AI software like ChatGPT to gain comprehensive and reliable information, reducing reliance on potentially misleading agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

The [[apollo_13_mission_overview | Apollo 13 mission]], launched on April 11, 1970, was intended to be the third human landing on the Moon, less than a year after the historic [[apollo_11_moon_landing_recount | Apollo 11 moon landing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite initial confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, the mission quickly turned into a fight for survival for its three astronauts: Commander Jim Lovell, Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, and Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This distressed journey became a testament to human ingenuity and teamwork under extreme pressure.

### The Initial Crisis: "Houston, We Have a Problem"

On April 13, when the spacecraft was approximately 330,000 km from Earth, a sudden, loud bang shook the entire vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Warning lights and alarms immediately activated, revealing that one oxygen tank had burst, and the other was rapidly leaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Astronaut Lovell famously reported, "Houston, we've had a problem here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, which was clarified by Swigert to "Houston, we have a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Initially, Mission Control suspected instrument malfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, the astronauts could see air leaking from the spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The explosion also shifted the spacecraft significantly off its intended trajectory, causing it to drift further from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Within hours, the astronauts set a new record for human distance from Earth, reaching 400,000 km, a record that remains unbroken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The focus immediately shifted from a lunar landing to mere survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Root Cause of the Explosion

An investigation later revealed that Oxygen Tank Number 2, which had previously been removed from Apollo 10 for modification, was damaged when it was accidentally dropped during repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. An internal tube was damaged, which went unnoticed during inspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. During pre-mission testing, heaters were used to boil off remaining liquid oxygen from the tank, but the internal thermometer, capped at 30°C, failed to register the actual temperature of 538°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This extreme heating damaged the electrical wire insulation, leading to a spark and subsequent explosion during a routine check on the third day of the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Fortunately, since the tank was on the exterior of the spacecraft, the explosion occurred outside, damaging a 13-foot panel in the service module rather than killing the astronauts instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Choosing the Return Path

Two options were considered for returning to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>:
1.  **Fastest way:** Rotate the spacecraft and use the main engine of the service module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. However, this engine was near the blast site, and its condition was unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
2.  **Longer way:** Continue towards the Moon, use its gravity to loop around it, and then head back to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This path would not require the main engine but would take 4-5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

NASA's flight director chose the second, longer option due to concerns about the main engine's integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### The Lunar Module as a Lifeboat

The astronauts were instructed to shut down the Command and Service Module (CSM) and use the Lunar Module (LM) as a "lifeboat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This posed significant [[challenges_and_incidents_during_apollo_13 | challenges]]:
*   The LM was designed for two astronauts for about 20 hours for a moon landing, not three astronauts for 4-5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   Its engines were not designed for repeated firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

To conserve vital supplies and energy, all non-essential systems, including heaters, were shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Trajectory Corrections and Carbon Dioxide Scrubber

The LM's engines were fired for the first time to put the spacecraft on its new path around the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This "burn" allowed them to reach the far side of the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Although the initial path would bring them back in 153 hours, leaving only an hour of surplus supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, Mission Control deemed this too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. A second LM engine burn reduced the flight time to 143 hours, providing an 11-hour survival margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

A critical problem arose with rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The LM's lithium hydroxide canisters, designed to remove CO2, were only sufficient for two people for two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. While the Command Module had spare canisters, their square filters did not fit the LM's circular ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Ground experts had 24 hours to devise a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Using plastic bags, cardboard, suit hoses, and duct tape (items available on board), they improvised a contraption to connect the square filters to the circular ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Commander Lovell noted in his book, *Lost Moon*, that "the contraption wasn't very handsome, but it worked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

### Water Conservation and Final Burn

To manage waste and preserve the spacecraft's trajectory, astronauts were restricted to 200 ml of water per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. This extreme rationing caused the three astronauts to collectively lose 14 kg, with astronaut Haise developing a urinary tract infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

As they approached Earth after four days, a final, unexpected burn of the lunar module's engine was needed to correct their trajectory, which had been affected by cooling vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Despite the LM being designed for only one burn, it remarkably withstood this third operation, bringing the spacecraft back on course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

### Re-entry and Safe Return

For re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, the astronauts had to return to the Command Module, as it was the only part designed to withstand the intense heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. As the Command Module entered the atmosphere, a normal communication blackout occurred due to air ionization, expected to last 2-3 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. However, this blackout extended to 4 minutes and 27 seconds, causing immense suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Finally, communication was re-established, confirming the survival of all three astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The command module safely deployed its parachutes and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Legacy of Apollo 13

Though the [[apollo_13_mission_overview | Apollo 13 mission]] failed in its primary objective of landing on the Moon, it became a historic rescue mission, celebrated for the incredible teamwork, leadership, and "thinking outside the box" displayed by both the astronauts and Mission Control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. The [[challenges_and_incidents_during_apollo_13 | investigation and lessons from the Columbia disaster]] led to the adoption of many new safety measures by NASA to prevent similar accidents in future missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Following Apollo 13, all subsequent Apollo missions (14, 15, 16, and 17) were successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

A recent phenomenon in India involves self-proclaimed spiritual leaders, often referred to as 'Babas,' who claim to possess miraculous powers, leading to challenges and [[legal_consequences_and_compensation_related_to_the_concordia_disaster | legal consequences]]. These individuals purportedly understand and solve believers' problems miraculously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, such claims often face scrutiny and opposition from rationalist organizations and individuals dedicated to promoting scientific temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

## Case Study: Bageshwar Baba (Dhirendra Shastri)

Dhirendra Shastri, also known as Bageshwar Baba, is a 26-year-old from Madhya Pradesh who runs an ashram called Bageshwar Dham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:46">[01:48:46]</a>. He gained popularity through claims of reading minds and providing miraculous solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:09">[03:55:09]</a>. He has also made controversial statements, including [[claims_of_spreading_hatred_and_misinformation | communal speeches]] urging Hindus to unite and take action against 'stone-pelters' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>, and has been accused of practicing untouchability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">[03:22:22]</a>. He claims to cure serious ailments like cancer with rituals, medicines, and blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.

## The Challenge by Shyam Manav

Shyam Manav, the National Convenor of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, emerged as a prominent challenger to Bageshwar Baba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:03">[04:03:03]</a>. This organization, founded by Narendra Dabholkar in the 1980s, is dedicated to fighting against [[criticism_of_superstitions_and_black_magic | superstitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:10">[04:10:10]</a>.

### Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti

The Samiti has a history of campaigning against fraudulent spiritual practices. Its founder, Narendra Dabholkar, was murdered in 2013, but his work led to the passing of a Maharashtra law against human sacrifices, [[criticism_of_superstitions_and_black_magic | superstitions]], and black magic in December 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Shyam Manav, who identifies as a Sanatani Hindu akin to Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda, opposes fraud in the name of religion and works within the framework of the Indian Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. He claims to have busted over 200 such fraud Babas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

### Key Cases by Shyam Manav

*   **Shakuntala Devi (The Human Computer):** Shyam Manav challenged her when she transitioned from mathematics programs to astrology and future predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. A police complaint and FIR were registered, leading her to stop practicing astrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Missionaries:** He fought against five missionaries in Nagpur who claimed to perform miracles like restoring sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Using the 1986 Drugs and Remedies Act, he lodged a complaint that resulted in the arrest of four foreign missionaries in India for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

### The Nagpur Incident (January 2023)

During Dhirendra Shastri's 'Ram Katha' event in Nagpur, Shyam Manav learned that the Baba was also holding a 'Divya Darbar' to perform alleged miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Manav's team reviewed 40-50 of the Baba's videos and found several illegalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

Manav informed the police with proof and requested action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. However, the Nagpur police later gave Dhirendra Shastri a clean chit, stating they found nothing against the Black Magic Act after examining the evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

Shyam Manav then publicly challenged Dhirendra Shastri to two tasks:
1.  Identify 10 people in a room by guessing their names, father's names, ages, and phone numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
2.  Predict 10 items kept in an adjacent room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

Manav offered a reward of â‚¹3 million for 90% accuracy and pledged to apologize, bow down, and disband his organization if the Baba won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

Dhirendra Shastri left Nagpur on January 11th, earlier than the poster's stated end date of January 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Shyam Manav called him a "deserter" for not accepting the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. In response, some Hindutva organizations protested and issued death threats to Shyam Manav, while Dhirendra Shastri's cousin claimed they also received threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. Dhirendra Shastri claimed his event was only scheduled until January 11th and invited Manav to challenge him in Raipur or Bageshwar Dham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Shyam Manav insisted the challenge must occur in Nagpur due to concerns about ensuring fairness and Maharashtra's law enforcement, especially given the state Home Minister's cordial relations with the Baba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## Broader Context of Miracle Claims and Legal Challenges

### Identifying Fake Babas

The Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad, the top body of Hindu Sadhus, issued a list of 14 fake Babas in 2017, warning people to beware of such conmen who "blight on sadhus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>. Notable names on this list included Aasharam, Radhe Ma, Nirmal Baba, Gurmeet Singh, and Narayan Sai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

The problem of fraudulent spiritual leaders is not limited to one religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Muslim conmen:** Akmal Raza, who demanded a woman's daughter to cure her husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, and Deen Mohammad, a black magic practitioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Christian conmen:** A case in Kerala where a woman was blackmailed using secret confessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, and Bajinder Singh, who claims to guess names, dispel evil spirits, and cure disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### The Role of Rationalism and Scientific Temperament

Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand stated that those claiming to perform miracles should use their abilities to solve societal problems like preventing land sinking in Joshimath, stopping forced religious conversions, suicides, disputes, and domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

James Randi, a famous magician, established the James Randi Foundation to promote scientific temperament and offered a $1 million paranormal challenge to anyone who could prove the existence of supernatural phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. No one has ever won this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

The prevalence of such scams highlights a lack of scientific temperament in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Reasons for people falling prey to these conmen include illiteracy, deficiencies in the education system that discourage critical thinking, and the exploitation of individuals' emotional distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. While mentalists like Karan Singh Magic and Suhani Shah perform similar feats of mind-reading for entertainment, they explicitly state these are tricks, unlike the conmen who claim miraculous powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

Exposing these conmen is considered crucial to protect society and benefit both religion and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

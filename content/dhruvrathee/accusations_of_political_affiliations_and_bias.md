This article addresses accusations of political affiliations and bias made against the creator and other entities, particularly by a YouTuber named Elvish. It details responses to these accusations and elaborates on the creator's stance on political and social issues.

## Accusations of AAP Affiliation
The creator discusses claims by pro-BJP YouTubers regarding his connections with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Elvish accused the creator of making a song praising AAP titled "5 Saal Kejriwal" on December 21, 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

The creator clarifies that the song "5 Saal Kejriwal" was originally made by Bollywood singer Vishal Dadlani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. He admits to making a re-edit of this song out of passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. His [[interest_in_politics_and_social_issues | interest in politics]] stemmed from the 2011-2012 India Against Corruption movement involving Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. When AAP was formed and gained public hope, especially winning 67 out of 70 seats in the February 2015 elections, he openly supported and volunteered for them using his editing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This support was done on his own volition and passion, without being asked or paid, and he was never an official or unofficial party member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

The creator states that AAP's initial [[corporate_funding_and_political_donations | political funding]] came from common people, not large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. He maintains that he did not receive any personal benefit from supporting AAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, and dismisses rumors of a "relative" in AAP as a baseless lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. He challenges the idea that if he were paid by AAP, he would be expected to praise Arvind Kejriwal daily, similar to how pro-BJP influencers praise Narendra Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## Accusations of DW Relationship and Anti-India Propaganda
Elvish attempted to create a "new conspiracy" about the creator's relationship with DW, a German news outlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Elvish claimed DW only shows "one side of the story," specifically showing "Hindus in India attack Muslims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. He also suggested DW always makes videos critical of Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

Elvish further linked the creator to Irfan Mehraj (mispronounced as "Mehra" by Elvish), a journalist he claimed worked for DW and TRT (The Arab, which Elvish misidentifies as "The Arab") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Elvish alleged that the "Turkish Intelligence Agency and Pakistan's Intelligence Agency ISI came together and founded TRT" to spread propaganda against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The creator refutes this, stating that the article Elvish referenced did not claim ISI founded TRT World, but rather that Turkey Intelligence Agency and ISI were starting a propaganda team through TRT World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The creator also notes that the article itself was "fake" and hosted by a [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | biased and untrustworthy website supporting BJP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Elvish also claimed that Irfan Mehraj was arrested by NIA due to links with "terrorist organizations like Al-Qaida" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The creator vehemently denies this, stating that Irfan Mehraj was never working with Al-Qaeda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. He highlights that Mehraj's arrest by the NIA has been labeled [[impact_of_political_influence_on_media | politically motivated]] by many international groups, and that the conviction has not been proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. The International Human Rights Watch has called for Mehraj's immediate release, deeming it a wrongful arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

The creator dismisses Elvish's logic of connection (Irfan Mehraj wrote for DW, and the creator makes travel videos for DW, therefore they are connected) as illogical, likening it to claiming Elvish and Dolly Bindra are best friends because both appeared on Bigg Boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Critiques of Elvish's Bias and Opportunism
The creator criticizes Elvish's selective outrage and hypocrisy, particularly regarding his shifting stance between secular and communal behaviors based on personal benefit.
*   **Opportunistic Behavior**: Elvish is accused of being an opportunist, playing secular or communal depending on his needs, much like his interpretation of Aurangzeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. An example cited is Elvish playing cricket with Munawar Farooqui, hugging and laughing, then later acting communal after being accused of being "anti-Hindu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Selective Outrage**: Elvish is accused of not opposing all injustice, instead demonstrating a heart "filled with hatred against a certain community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. The creator highlights Elvish's silence on issues like Manipur violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a> and Kashmiri Pandits' strike (unless used to criticize Muslims) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. This contrasts with the creator's stated position of being against injustice for any person, regardless of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Hero-worshipping and Flattery**: Elvish is accused of "worshipping" and "flattering" PM Modi, posting photos with BJP leader Smriti Irani, and describing Modi as "devoted to Ram and our nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The creator contrasts this with his own content, which Elvish claims is paid for, while Elvish's own flattery is presented as genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

### Response to Dictatorship Accusations
Elvish questioned why the creator made a "dictatorship video" about PM Modi, arguing that Modi shares memes and therefore cannot be a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The creator dismisses this as an illogical defense, pointing to actual examples of "growing dictatorial tendencies" such as:
*   Arrests for "Modi Hatao Desh Bachao" posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   Suspension of over 140 MPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   Weaponization of central agencies like ED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
The creator states that Google searches reveal "a long list" of people arrested for criticizing Narendra Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

Elvish, in turn, labeled the creator a "dictator" for blocking "vile and insolent trolls" on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. The creator clarifies that blocking someone is not deleting their account but merely stopping interaction, comparing it to not talking to someone who is rude in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. He contrasts this with real oppression of free speech, such as ANI issuing copyright strikes against Ramit Verma's channel "Official PeeingHuman" for a video critical of ANI and its editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

## General Media and Societal Bias
The creator makes broader points about [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | media bias and misinformation in Indian politics]] and societal issues:
*   **Media Loyalty**: The creator notes that "Media isn't loyal to anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **[[historical_interpretations_and_biases | Historical interpretations and biases]]**: The creator states that he said Aurangzeb was an opportunist who "pretended to be secular, and communal at others, depending upon the need of the hour," not that he was secular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Divisive Nationalism**: The creator argues that dividing one's own country in the name of religion and [[claims_of_spreading_hatred_and_misinformation | spreading hatred]] cannot be patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. He references the Upanishads, stating that "the earth is the home of the generous," promoting the idea of the world as one family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
*   **Exploitation of Religious Sentiment**: The creator criticizes the "pro-BJP ecosystem" for abusing Hindus from Ayodhya after BJP lost the election there, highlighting that their only religion is "worshipping Modi" and "flatter[ing] those in power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

## Call for Positive Change

7.  Improving his understanding of basic concepts like percentages and gold rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
8.  Encouraging his followers (Elvish Army) to stop using vile language and insulting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
9.  Creating songs that make a positive contribution to Indian culture instead of glamorizing weapons or objectifying women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
10. Ceasing violent and threatening behavior to avoid further [[criticisms_and_updates_on_ongoing_investigations | legal trouble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

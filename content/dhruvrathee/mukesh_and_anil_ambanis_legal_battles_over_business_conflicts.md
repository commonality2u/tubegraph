The story of Anil Ambani's significant business downfall in the 21st century is largely based on a little-known [[the_ambani_brothers_feud_and_its_impact_on_their_empire | fight between two brothers]], Mukesh and Anil Ambani, which had a profound impact on India's political and financial systems, even involving politicians from various parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. In 2008, Anil Ambani was the 6th richest person globally with $42 billion, surpassing his brother Mukesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, by 2024, [[anil_ambanis_business_struggles_and_debts | Anil Ambani's companies were in debt]] to the tune of â‚¹1,720 billion (approximately $20 billion) and he was facing numerous court cases, with SEBI banning him from the Indian market for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Early Tensions and Family Dynamics

The foundation of the conflict can be traced back to their father, Dhirubhai Ambani, who began transferring business responsibilities to Mukesh and Anil after suffering a stroke in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Mukesh, an introvert, handled operations, focusing on timely and budget-conscious mega-projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Anil, an extrovert, became the public face of Reliance, managing public relations, corporate affairs, lobbying, and government marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Dhirubhai showed a clear preference for Mukesh, making him Vice Chairman of Reliance in 1991, while Anil remained Joint Managing Director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This preference stemmed from several factors, including [[influence_of_family_dynamics_on_the_ambani_brothers | family dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Anil's decision to marry Tina Munim, a glamorous Bollywood celebrity who was considered modern and had a past live-in relationship with actor Rajesh Khanna, was strongly opposed by the conservative Ambani family, especially Dhirubhai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Dhirubhai even used his influence to orchestrate an ED raid on Tina, which was confirmed by a 2015 Caravan Magazine article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Despite this, Anil insisted on the marriage, threatening to leave the family if Tina wasn't accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. They married in February 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. In contrast, Mukesh married Neeta Dalal, chosen by his mother, and Neeta became the "real daughter-in-law" of the family, while Tina remained an outsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The hiring of Sandeep Tandon, the IRS officer who raided Tina's house, as a consultant at Reliance with Mukesh's approval further upset Anil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## The Public Divide and Asset Allocation

The world became aware of the widening rift when Reliance entered the telecom sector with Reliance Infocomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Anil and his supporters were largely excluded from significant roles in this venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Mukesh controlled the holding company, Reliance Communication Infrastructure Limited, and held top positions in RIL, Reliance's main company, filling them with his loyalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Anil felt sidelined and that his efforts in managing politicians, bureaucrats, and media were unappreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

After Dhirubhai's death in July 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, Mukesh took control of Reliance, with Anil as Second-in-Command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Tensions escalated, with Anil accusing Mukesh of using RIL to finance his telecom venture and benefit himself and his friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Neeta Ambani's increasing role in Reliance Infocomm's advertising and branding also bothered Anil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. In July 2004, the Reliance Board restricted Anil's financial powers while granting Mukesh full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Mukesh was uncomfortable with Anil's close [[role_of_political_connections_in_anil_ambanis_business_decisions | political connections]] with Samajwadi Party's Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Anil's Rajya Sabha nomination as an independent candidate from UP with their help, clashed with the newly elected Congress government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Mukesh believed this was detrimental to Reliance's business interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Additionally, Mukesh was displeased by Anil's obligation to declare his and his wife's wealth during the Rajya Sabha nomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

The "Brothers' Feud" became public knowledge in late 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Mukesh's accidental public statement about "ownership issues" within the Reliance Group, later retracted, opened the floodgates for media scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Anil gained the upper hand in the media war, leading to a deterioration of Mukesh's public image by December 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Due to government pressure, including from Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, and the intervention of their mother Kokilaben, Mukesh agreed to a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. In June 2005, an agreement was signed, dividing the Reliance Group assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>:
*   **Mukesh** received flagship companies like RIL and Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Anil** received Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Energy, and Reliance Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

They also signed a 10-year non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Mukesh secured 60%-70% of the Reliance Group assets, while Anil received 30%-40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Post-Split Conflicts: The Gas Wars

Despite the settlement, conflicts continued. Mukesh was reportedly upset that Anil received Reliance Infocomm, his "dream project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. An opportunity arose in January 2008 when Anil launched Reliance Power's IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. The day after its launch, the company's shares dropped by almost 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Anil claimed that Mauritius-based companies connected to Mukesh were behind the share dumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### The MTN Deal and Political Pressure
Anil faced another setback during his attempt to merge Reliance Communications with South African telecom company MTN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Mukesh opposed the deal, citing the non-compete agreement which stipulated a right of first refusal for the other brother if either wanted to sell their stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Anil attempted to bypass this by directly purchasing MTN shares, but MTN withdrew due to the Ambani brothers' infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Anil also claimed Mukesh used [[role_of_political_connections_in_anil_ambanis_business_decisions | political pressure]] to harm his ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This included the Delhi and Mumbai airport privatization bid where Anil's company was the highest bidder, but the contract was awarded to the second-highest bidder due to "significant conflict of interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Similar issues arose with coal-based methane extraction contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

### The Gas Wars Legal Battle
The most significant conflict was the "Gas Wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. The 2005 settlement allocated gas exploration to Mukesh and power generation to Anil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Anil planned a gas-based power plant in Dadri, UP, requiring gas from Mukesh's Krishna-Godavari Basin discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Mukesh had promised gas at $2.34 per million British thermal units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

The dispute escalated when the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas refused to approve this price, stating that the government determined natural resource prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Anil claimed this decision benefited Mukesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. In September 2007, an empowered group of ministers approved the gas price at $4.21, nearly double the agreed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Anil took the matter to court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

In 2009, the Bombay High Court ruled in Anil's favor, ordering Mukesh to honor the family agreement and sell gas at $2.34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Mukesh's company appealed to the Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. The government intervened, filing a petition stating that natural gas is national property and only the government could decide its price, seeking to invalidate the contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Anil accused the UPA government and the Petroleum Ministry of favoring Mukesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

In the midst of this, on April 23, 2009, Anil Ambani's helicopter was found to have been sabotaged with stones, soil, and pebbles in its fuel tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Experts stated it would have crashed if flown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. A few days later, the technician who discovered the sabotage, Bharat Borge, was found dead with a suicide note, mentioning questioning by Mukesh's company officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

The Supreme Court eventually ruled that gas is government property, and only the government can decide its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. This judgment greatly benefited Mukesh and resulted in billions of rupees in losses for Anil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Following this, the shares of Anil Ambani's companies, including Reliance Power, crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. On May 23, 2010, the brothers scrapped their non-compete agreement, allowing them to compete in any business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

## Anil's Decline and Further Legal Troubles

Anil's Dadri power project faced additional issues. The land, acquired using an emergency provision by the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in 2004, ignored farmers' rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. In December 2009, the Allahabad High Court sided with the farmers, stating that a No Objection Certificate was required from every farmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Anil appealed to the Supreme Court but eventually stated in 2014 that he was no longer interested in the project due to gas supply difficulties and agreed to return the land, incurring billions in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

### Telecom Challenges
Anil's telecom business also faced immense challenges. Inheriting it, he underestimated its competitiveness and investment needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. By 2010, the industry was shifting to 3G, requiring billions in investments for new equipment and spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Anil's investments led to Reliance Communications incurring â‚¹300 billion in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

The alleged 2G spectrum scam in 2011 resulted in the cancellation of 122 telecom licenses, including one held by Anil Ambani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. CBI interrogated Anil about his role in promoting Swan Telecom and selling its shares at eroded prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

A major blow came with Mukesh Ambani's launch of Reliance Jio in 2016, offering free 4G services that attracted all customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. By 2017, Reliance Communications' debt reached â‚¹430 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Anil tried to sell assets to Reliance Jio, but Mukesh refused to be a guarantor for the debt, causing the deal to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

## Final Downfall and SEBI Ban

By 2018, Anil Ambani was regularly in court due to escalating debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Ericsson accused him of default, leading to a Supreme Court order for Anil to repay â‚¹5.5 billion by September 30, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. When he failed to do so, Ericsson filed a contempt petition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. The Court threatened him with jail time if the payment wasn't made by March 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. His mother, Kokilaben, intervened, asking Mukesh to help Anil avoid imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. Mukesh eventually paid the dues, saving his brother from jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

On September 25, 2019, the National Company Law Tribunal declared Reliance Communications insolvent, initiating the sale of assets to repay debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

### Reasons for Downfall
According to India Today, Anil's downfall stemmed from venturing into capital-intensive businesses based on ambition rather than strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. His strategy often involved securing funding from public sector banks using [[role_of_political_connections_in_anil_ambanis_business_decisions | political connections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. However, after the 2008 global financial crisis, banks became hesitant to fund the power and infrastructure sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

Anil's companies began selling assets to manage debt:
*   In 2014, Reliance Entertainment sold its multiplex chain Big Cinemas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
*   In August 2018, he sold Reliance Infrastructure's Mumbai City Power Distribution business to Gautam Adani for â‚¹188 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

In September 2018, Anil told shareholders that â‚¹1,200 billion worth of investments were stuck because 24,000 MW power generation plants could not secure gas supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

During the asset allocation, Anil received cash-hungry businesses needing constant innovation and investment, while Mukesh acquired core businesses like oil and gas, which required less frequent investment and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Anil lacked businesses that provided continuous cash flow for further investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. His success depended on the flow of funding from banks and investors, which eventually ceased, leading to increasing debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.

### Chinese Banks Lawsuit
Three Chinese banks, controlled by the Chinese government, filed a lawsuit in London's High Court against Anil Ambani for defaulting on a $925 million loan taken in 2012 for Reliance Communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Anil, as personal guarantor for this loan, stated in court that his net worth was zero and he had nothing left to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. The judge, however, refused to believe him, suggesting he must have undeclared assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. Anil clarified that the help received from Mukesh was a one-time occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

In February 2022, SEBI banned Anil Ambani from being a director in any listed entity due to charges of fund diversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. He resigned from the Boards of Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power in March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. The ban was extended for five years in August 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Anil Ambani has largely withdrawn from public life, reportedly becoming more religious and spiritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. Despite advice to declare bankruptcy, he continues to seek a comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. The story highlights that even immense wealth cannot replace family unity or control ego and pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. Had the brothers worked together, their lives could have been vastly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. A comparison can be drawn to the [[ratan_tatas_leadership_and_global_acquisitions | Tata family]], whose story is quite different from that of the Ambani family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

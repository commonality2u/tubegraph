This article details the childhood and early life of Dhruv Rathee, based on his personal reflections shared in a video celebrating 10 million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The video offers a look into his past, including previously unshared childhood videos and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Birth and Early Family Life
Dhruv Rathee was born in Rohtak, Haryana, in October 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He grew up in a small, middle-class family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. His parents were young, around 24-25 years old at the time of his birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. His mother worked as a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, and his father was an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, with their combined monthly income being about ₹4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Early childhood videos were rare due to the scarcity of video cameras, though some photos exist from this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Early Travels
During his infancy, Rathee traveled extensively, though he does not remember these trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Photos show him in places ranging from snowy Srinagar to the Jaisalmer desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These travels were due to his maternal grandfather's service in the BSF (Border Security Force), which involved frequent postings across India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. His parents would visit his maternal grandparents at these various locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

His earliest memories are from Rohtak, where he remembers playing in Rohtak's lake and at his paternal grandparents' home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Move to Delhi and First Foreign Trip
Some years later, his parents moved to Delhi for better job opportunities, as his father secured a job with a better salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Around 2002-2003, their combined salary in Delhi was approximately ₹17,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

A significant turning point occurred in 2003 when his father was offered a better job in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and subsequently moved there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, his mother, brother, and he remained in Delhi because the increased living expenses in Malaysia would have nullified the salary boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. They would visit Malaysia once a year during summer vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This marked his first opportunity to visit abroad in the summer of 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. During this month-long stay, he experienced new things, including eating a waffle with maple syrup for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This was also his first encounter with Lego, which had a significant impact on his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It was in Malaysia that his family bought their first digital camera, resulting in some early videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### First Video Creation (Claymation)
Around the age of 8-9 years old in 2003, with ample free time, Rathee made his first video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. His family had a computer and recently acquired a webcam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. He learned that taking 24 photos in succession and playing them back could create a 1-second video, thus understanding the concept of frame rates (24fps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This realization led him to create animated films using clay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. He would create clay characters, use a white sheet as a background, and take photos with the webcam, moving the characters slightly between each shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This process, known as Claymation, resulted in short 1-2 second videos where the clay characters appeared to move on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Childhood Interests
Like other children of his time, he enjoyed reading comics, particularly Tinkle comics, which were his favorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. He also enjoyed watching cartoons on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Popeye was his favorite cartoon, which he credits with influencing his obsession with healthy eating, especially promoting spinach and other vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Since the age of 12, he has not consumed soft drinks like Pepsi or Coca-Cola, driven by this obsession with healthy eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Teenage Years and Career Aspirations
By 2008, when he was around 14-15 years old, reading became a passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He attributes this solely to Satyajit Ray's books, specifically the Feluda series, which he read daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. At this point, he wanted to be a criminal investigator or a detective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. However, he soon realized through internet research that modern detectives were not like those depicted in novels, often being hired for cases like catching cheating spouses, making it a "terrible career option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Around the same time, he developed an interest in mechanical robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. His parents bought him Lego blocks that allowed him to create and program robots with touch and light sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. He spent hours building and programming his own robot to carry a digital camera, changing direction when its touch sensor was activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. He believes that if any child is given such toys and spends enough time with them, they could build similar things, especially without the distractions of social media present today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

By 2010, his career aspiration shifted to becoming a host on National Geographic or Discovery Channel, as he was fascinated by programs like Bear Grylls' *Man vs. Wild* and travel shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. He now considers himself fortunate to be doing something similar on his vlog channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Developing Political Interest
His interest in politics began in December 2011, sparked by the protests against rampant corruption led by Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal, and other social activists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. These protests received significant positive media coverage, something he finds difficult to imagine today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. He states that his family has no political connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Before 2011, he had no interest in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

His interest deepened after 2012-2013, with the formation of the AAP government in Delhi and particularly when [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles | Narendra Modi]] became Prime Minister in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Like many, he was initially delighted by the Congress government losing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. His political ideology at the time was "100% anti-Congress," influenced by the media narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. However, within a few months, he realized what he perceived as misdirections, such as black money not returning, the dilution of RTI, and the legalization of foreign funding for political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This frustration led him to publish his initial YouTube videos, though the very first video on his channel was a travel vlog in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Academic Journey
Rathee describes himself as an "above-average student," typically scoring 70%-80% in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. He followed a philosophy, which he later identified as the 80-20 rule, where he studied just enough to get a good score without aiming to be a topper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. He believed that while achieving 80% was relatively easy, reaching 100% required significantly more effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. His parents were content with his performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. He later applied the 80-20 rule more broadly in his life, focusing on achieving 80% perfection with minimum effort for many tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

After completing his 12th board exams in 2012 with 85% marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, he wanted to keep his options open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. He took admission tests for various colleges, including Manipal University, IIT, and JEE, but his ranks were not sufficient for admission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. He acknowledges that the 80-20 philosophy is not suitable for aspiring toppers aiming for institutions like IIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

### NDA Aspirations
His first choice was to join the Indian Air Force or Army, rather than engineering colleges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. The reasons were his perception of office jobs as boring compared to the physically challenging and adventurous nature of army life, and the fact that several relatives were in the Army, including his maternal grandfather and two uncles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

He studied diligently for the NDA exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. After passing the written test, he was called for the SSB interview in Varanasi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. He was confident about the physical test portion, but found the actual interview ironic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. In a group discussion, he struggled to articulate his points effectively due to his slow speaking style, whereas the interviewers sought candidates who could speak straightforwardly, loudly, and clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. He failed this interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### Studying Abroad in Germany
Following his NDA interview failure, his parents explored colleges outside India, believing it was better than attending a "C-grade engineering college in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. They chose Germany because developed English-speaking countries like the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada had high tuition fees, while Germany and other European countries offered almost free education, especially if studying in local languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. His parents took an education loan to cover living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

He received acceptance from Eindhoven University in the Netherlands and Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. He believes his admission to these well-respected universities without being a topper was largely due to luck and less competition from foreign applicants in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Foreign universities also emphasize other skills, hobbies, and experiences over just marks, and his interest in Lego robots might have played a role in his application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

In August 2012, at 17 years old, he moved to Germany to study Mechanical Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. His choice of engineering was partly due to his childhood interest in robotics but largely because many of his friends chose it, and it was a common belief that engineering provided a broad foundation if unsure about a career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. He later found the subject interesting and completed his Bachelor's in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, followed by a Master's in Renewable Engineering from the same university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

## Personal Life and YouTube Journey
In 2014, while doing an internship away from the university, he met Juli on a tram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. They took the same tram daily, with Juli going to school and him to his internship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. They married exactly 7.5 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

A few months after meeting Juli in 2014, he uploaded his first video on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. His childhood interest in making videos resurfaced after discovering the platform, and he began uploading regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. By 2017, his channel crossed 50,000 subscribers, but his parents and he initially didn't believe it could be a viable career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

After completing his Master's degree in 2018, and another Bachelor's in Economics and Business Management (purely out of interest to make better videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, he prioritized YouTube as his #1 focus after 2017-2018, believing he could achieve something unique with his passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## Philosophy on Passion and Excellence
Rathee emphasizes that passion and enjoyment make consistency and discipline easier, though effort and hard work are still required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. He echoes a famous dialogue from the movie *3 Idiots*:
> "A great man once said, 'Study not to be successful, but to be capable.' Don't chase success. Excellence, chase excellence. And success will follow you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>

He states he never focused on subscriber numbers but consistently aimed to improve himself, the quality of his videos, and his message delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

## Childhood Videos Shared
The video includes clips from his childhood, demonstrating his early creativity and interests:
*   A "news report" about the weather, showing a young Dhruv commenting on the sky and sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
*   A "sports news" segment where he presents a new game he invented called "Hockey-Football," explaining it by combining a hockey stick and a football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   Another "sports news" segment featuring an "imaginary ball" and a "weird sport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

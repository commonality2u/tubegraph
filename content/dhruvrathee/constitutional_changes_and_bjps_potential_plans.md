Ahead of the election results announcement, various opinion polls in March 2024 projected significant wins for the BJP-led NDA. News18's poll predicted 411 seats, while India TV's CNX poll estimated 399 seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Prime Minister Modi launched his campaign with the slogan of winning "more than 400 seats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Intent to Change the Constitution
The significance of the "400 seats" slogan became a point of discussion due to statements from several BJP leaders. Figures like Jyoti Mirdha, Anant Kumar Hegde, Arun Govil, and Lallu Singh made remarks hinting at the BJP's intention to change the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, specifically stating, "They want to change our Constitution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

To amend the Constitution, a majority in both houses of Parliament—the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha—is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Following these statements, the BJP officially refuted them, with other leaders coming forward to issue clarifications after the election campaign had begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Concerns Regarding Dictatorship
The potential for constitutional changes fueled concerns among citizens about India's democratic future. The speaker expressed worry that India, the world's largest democracy, should not transform into a [[is_india_moving_towards_dictatorship | dictatorship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This concern intensified after incidents like the Chandigarh election fraud in February, where a presiding officer was caught committing voter fraud on CCTV, an act the Supreme Court deemed a "murder of democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Other issues contributing to these concerns included biased media, overthrowing elected governments, and horse-trading of MLAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

These events prompted the creation of a video titled "[[concerns_about_dictatorship_in_india | Is India becoming a dictatorship?]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Further incidents, such as the arrests of Arvind Kejriwal and the freezing of Congress's bank accounts, deepened the belief that earlier predictions of a shift towards [[is_india_moving_towards_dictatorship | dictatorship]] were proving true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

The speaker acknowledged the fear that if BJP were to win 400 seats, it could lead the country towards a "complete [[is_india_moving_towards_dictatorship | dictatorship]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Despite such concerns, the commitment remains to continue advocating for democracy and the Constitution, regardless of election outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The movement aims to ensure that the government remains answerable and to address persistent issues like unemployment, pollution, and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

## Influence on Indian Media and Political Environment

The transcript discusses how political influence shapes both the Indian media landscape and the broader political environment, highlighting a system of reward and punishment based on loyalty, propaganda, and a perceived authoritarian approach to governance.

### Media Control and Image Building

The speaker asserts that an [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | artificial image]] of Narendra Modi is presented to the public through platforms like WhatsApp and traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This manufactured image is contrasted with what the speaker claims is Modi's "real personality" and "real mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Instances of media suppression and control are cited:
*   NDTV faced a CBI raid before its sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   News Laundry was subjected to an Income Tax survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   BBC India and The Wire were raided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   "Godi Media" (pro-government media) receives government advertisements and exclusive interviews with Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Notably, Modi reportedly did not give interviews to NDTV until it was acquired by Adani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

On social media, criticism is met with bans, blocks, and harassment from IT cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Examples include the Bolta Hindustan YouTube channel being taken down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>, 177 Twitter accounts being withheld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>, and the Kisan Ekta Morcha Twitter handle being removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

The speaker also highlights the use of filmmakers like Vivek Agnihotri and Sudipto Sen for "baseless propaganda," who are then rewarded with free publicity and National Awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

### Political Narrative and Manipulation

The political environment is characterized by a "two-faced" approach to narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Communal vs. Secular Stance:** Modi's branding as "Communal Narendra Modi" began after the 2002 riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, he also makes speeches perceived as "Hindu-Muslim speeches" to appeal to a specific segment of "brainwashed people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Conversely, in Bihar, Modi presented himself as a "peace messenger," vowing not to divide the country on religious lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, and has even praised Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Amit Shah has also publicly stated that BJP does not view India as a Hindu nation and follows the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Tailored Appeals:** To garner votes, Modi adapts his speeches to different regions and communities. He adopts different "relationships" with various groups like Sikhs, Buddhists, Bohra Muslims, Christians, tribals, and even countries like China and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This includes claiming emotional connections to specific places or communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Policies:** The transcript points to contradictory stances, such as BJP in Uttar Pradesh advocating against cow slaughter while promising quality beef in Kerala and stating no plans to ban beef in Goa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Unfulfilled Promises:** Past slogans and promises like "Achhe Din," cleaning River Ganga, "100 smart cities," and bringing back black money are now considered expired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Campaigns like Make in India are no longer seen on election posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Modi's past criticisms of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> and promises of zero corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> are noted as being absent from current discourse.

### Reward and Punishment System

The speaker describes a system where loyalty to Narendra Modi is paramount, influencing appointments and careers across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

*   **Political Appointments and Sidelining:** Modi reportedly knows "whom to get close to and whom to sideline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Examples include the ousting of Shankar Singh Vaghela and Keshubhai Patel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, and the isolation of Lal Krishna Advani after Atal Bihari Vajpayee's request for ethical governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Other leaders like Jaswant Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj, and Nitin Gadkari were reportedly marginalized or removed from key positions for various reasons, including expressing differing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Rewarding Loyalty:** Conversely, individuals who demonstrate devotion are promoted rapidly. Nirmala Sitharaman, Smriti Irani, Ashwini Vaishnav, and Jyotiraditya Scindia are cited as examples of quick career advancement after aligning with Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Influence on Institutions:** This pattern extends to institutions:
    *   **Judiciary:** Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi was given a Rajya Sabha seat shortly after retirement, following Supreme Court judgments favoring the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Supreme Court Judge Arun Mishra openly praised PM Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
    *   **Reserve Bank of India:** RBI Governors Raghuram Rajan and Urjit Patel, and Deputy Governor Viral Acharya, faced issues or resigned during clashes with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
    *   **Election Commission:** Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa was removed after refusing to give a clean chit on Narendra Modi's hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, and the Chief Justice of India was removed from the Election Commissioner selection panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
    *   **Bureaucracy and Cultural Institutes:** The "lateral entry scheme" allows private sector individuals to be directly appointed to high bureaucratic posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Individuals like Lokesh Chandra (appointed head of Indian Council for Cultural Relations) and Pahlaj Nihalani (appointed CBFC chairman) were rewarded for praising Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
    *   **Education:** Gajendra Chauhan, who campaigned for Modi, was appointed Chairman of FTII Pune despite a list of more qualified suggestions and student protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
    *   **Sports:** Jay Shah, Amit Shah's son, heads the BCCI despite questions about his qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

### Perceived Authoritarianism and Self-Obsession

The speaker connects these patterns to psychologist Ashis Nandy's 1996 interview with Modi, where Nandy reportedly found traits of an [[impact_of_political_influence_on_media | authoritarian personality]] and categorized Modi as falling under the diagnostic category of a "F@scist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. These traits include "Puritanical Rigidity," "strict adherence to moral or religious codes," "a constricted emotional life," "fear of one's own passion," and "a huge ego that hides the insecurity inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the BJP wants not just votes but "full control of your mind" and "worship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. This control extends to all aspects of the country, with loyalists being placed in every system: politicians, ministers, judges, bureaucrats, and cultural institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. The only criterion for advancement is loyalty to Narendra Modi, regardless of corruption, criminality, or incompetence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

Evidence of self-obsession is also presented:
*   The renaming of Sardar Patel stadium to Narendra Modi Stadium, with ends named after Ambani and Adani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   Modi repositioning others for camera angles during events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   His prominent placement during the Ram Mandir inauguration compared to the Akshardham temple inauguration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   Displaying Modi's photos and quotes at historical sites like Gandhi Darshan Museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.
*   Naming government schemes, roads, and hospitals after himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.
*   Extensive photo shoots and printing his image on free food bags and COVID vaccine certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

The speaker concludes by stating that such behavior, including labeling critics as traitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>, is a formula for [[challenges_to_indian_democracy_and_opposition | dictatorship]] and urges citizens to protect democracy and the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

The **Uttar Kand** is a section of the Ramayana that is widely considered a later addition to the original text. It contains narratives that lead to specific [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_ramayana | allegations against Lord Ram]], such as his abandonment of his pregnant wife Sita and the killing of a Shudra named Shambuk for meditating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These points were notably mentioned by Dr. Ambedkar in his booklet, *Riddles of Ram and Krishna* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Original Ending of Valmiki's Ramayana

The original Valmiki's Ramayana concludes with Chapter 128 of its sixth section, the Yuddha Kand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This chapter serves as the "happily ever after" ending, where Ram is crowned king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. During Ram's reign, the kingdom is described as a utopian period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:
*   Ram performed various rituals such as Paundarika, Ashvamedha, and Vajapeya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   There were no dangers from wild animals, diseases, thieves, or dacoits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   People lived for thousands of years, free from disease or sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Elderly individuals did not have to perform the last rites for their young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Trees bore fruits and flowers regularly, and clouds rained punctually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   The touch of the wind was blissful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   All varnas—Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra—performed their duties contentedly, without greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Shloka 106 of this section states that everyone possessed distinct qualities and behaved ethically, leading to Ram's reign lasting for 10,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This detailed "happily ever after" conclusion suggests the story's completeness at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Following this, only the section of Phalashruti remained in the original Ramayana, which outlines the benefits of listening to the scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The final Shloka in this section, 125, explicitly states that "This narration is to be listened invariably by good people, seeking for wisdom, longevity, health, fame, fraternity, intelligence, welfare and brilliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Another verse, Shloka 108 in the Phalashruti section, confirms that "This foremost lyric... as written at first by Valmiki" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, indicating the scripture's completion.

## Evidence of Uttar Kand as a Later Addition

The **Uttar Kand** is considered a later [[misinterpretations_and_later_additions_to_the_ramayana | addition to the Ramayana]] due to significant contradictions with the original text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>:

*   **Contradiction with Ram Rajya Description**: The Shambuk story in the Uttar Kand, where a Brahmin's son dies causing grief and Ram kills Shambuk, directly contradicts the description of Ram Rajya where no old person had to perform last rites for the young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Pushpak Viman's Return**: In Chapter 127 of Valmiki's Yuddha Kand, Ram returns the Pushpak Viman to Kuber after returning to Ayodhya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. However, the Uttar Kand depicts Ram using the Pushpak Viman to search for Shambuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, a clear inconsistency.
*   **Kuber's Messenger Incident**: Uttar Kand's Chapter 13 describes Ravan killing Kuber's messenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Yet, in Valmiki's Sundarkand, Chapter 52, Shloka 15, Vibhishan advises Ravan on acceptable punishments for messengers, explicitly stating that killing a messenger was unheard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This contradiction further suggests the Uttar Kand's non-originality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

These inconsistencies lead to the conclusion that the Uttar Kand is not part of the original Ramayana and should not be considered a continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Motivations for the Addition

Historically, there is no solid evidence regarding the exact authorship or timing of the Uttar Kand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. However, it is speculated that this addition was made to promote certain societal agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>:
*   **Brahmanical Superiority and Casteism**: The Shambuk narrative appears to assert the superiority of Brahmins over Shudras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Patriarchy**: The story of Sita's abandonment seems to be an attempt to promote patriarchal views, emphasizing male power and control over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

It is believed that "casteist and sexist people" added this continuation to the Ramayana to serve their agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Nature of the Ramayana Story

The Ramayana is a religious scripture, historically estimated to have been written by Valmiki between the 7th and 4th century BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The question of whether the stories within it literally occurred remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

Many aspects of the Ramayana are seen as [[metaphorical_and_literal_interpretations_of_the_ramayana | metaphorical]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. For instance, the story of Lord Hanuman picking up a mountain and flying across the sea is not physically possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Instead, such descriptions might be metaphors to convey immense effort or power, similar to common phrases like "carrying a mountain on his shoulders" or "crossing the seven oceans for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Additionally, the literary device of *Atishayokti Alankar* (exaggeration) may have been employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This is common in literature, where real events are embellished to make them more entertaining or larger than life, as seen in historical films like "300" or exaggerated historical accounts of figures like Maharana Pratap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

This metaphorical and exaggerated interpretation extends to miraculous stories across religions, such as Jesus turning water into wine, Prophet Muhammad splitting the moon, or Lord Hanuman swallowing the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These are considered mythological stories, not to be taken literally, but to carry deeper symbolic messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. For example, Hanuman swallowing the sun could symbolize victory over nature or control over one's senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

The essential message of religious scriptures lies beyond literal interpretations, encouraging individuals to focus on the inherent wisdom rather than ego-driven validation of their faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. The [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | qualities of Lord Ram]] – being fit, strong, humble, and compassionate – are presented as universal values, making him a model for everyone, regardless of their religious beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

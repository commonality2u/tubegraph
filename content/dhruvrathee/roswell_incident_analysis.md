The Roswell Incident refers to a series of events in July 1947, when a widespread craze of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) swept across America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Many people reported seeing "flying saucers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This phenomenon began on June 24th, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen nine shining UFOs flying near Seattle at speeds of 2,000 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Within two weeks, similar sightings were reported across America and heavily discussed in the media, with some linking them to atomic sites and nuclear test areas due to concentrations of sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Initial Discovery and Official Statements

Around the same time, Mac Brazel, a man from New Mexico, recalled finding unusual debris on his field three weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. This debris consisted of tin foil, rubber, and a thin wooden beam, which he couldn't identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. Wondering if it was connected to the UFO craze, Brazel took the material to the Roswell Sheriff on July 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

This discovery caught the attention of Colonel William Blanchard, the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Airfield (RAAF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>. The next day, July 8th, the RAAF released a statement confirming that "the rumours of the flying disks had come true," and that the 509th Bomb Group of the 8th Airforce "was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. This suggested the US Army had found proof of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:40">[01:51:40]</a>.

However, the very next day, US Army officials retracted their statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>. They announced that the debris was merely from a weather balloon, and photos of Major Marcel were released showing him with pieces of a weather balloon as proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:40">[01:59:40]</a>. Following this, the news subsided, and the public's interest waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:40">[02:12:40]</a>.

## Resurgence of Alien Theories

Years later, in the late 1970s, rumors about the Roswell Incident re-emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:40">[02:20:40]</a>. New theories suggested an alien craft had been spotted flying over the New Mexico desert, struck by lightning, and crashed, killing the aliens inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:40">[02:26:40]</a>. In 1980, Major Marcel himself contributed to these theories by writing "The Roswell Incident," a book claiming the debris he had seen was "from nothing made 'on this Earth'" and "didn't seem to be from this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:40">[02:39:40]</a>.

The significance of the Roswell Incident grew, leading to new theories, including claims that a living alien was discovered in the crash and kept at a secret base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40">[02:54:40]</a>. Some believe this alien is still imprisoned at a top-secret base and that the US Army is attempting to reverse-engineer alien technology and research alien life, specifically at [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51|Area 51]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:40">[03:02:40]</a>.

## Official Explanation and Continued Skepticism

The official explanation for the Roswell debris was revealed in 1994 when the US Air Force confirmed it was a nuclear surveillance balloon, a spy device developed under Project Mogul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:40">[15:58:40]</a>. The purpose of these balloons was to detect sound waves from a large distance when the Soviet Union tested its nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:40">[16:09:40]</a>.

Despite this explanation, conspiracy theories persisted due to repeated misstatements from the government, which eroded public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:40">[16:21:40]</a>. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) deliberately used the mystery of UFOs to cover up the testing of its top-secret spy planes, such as the U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird, at [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51|Area 51]] during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:40">[13:39:40]</a>.

The initial Roswell statement about a "disk" was allowed to run for a day to foster belief in UFOs, but then retracted to prevent public outcry and paranoia if the government had admitted to the existence of aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:40">[13:17:40]</a>. Many supposed UFO sightings, including the re-emergence of rumors in the 1970s, coincided with the testing of these high-altitude, fast-flying military aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:40">[13:49:40]</a>. These unconventional-looking aircraft, flying at high altitudes (10,000m to 26,000m) around sunset, could appear as fast-moving, unidentified objects when illuminated by the sun's rays, leading people to believe they were UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:40">[16:37:40]</a>.

### Debunking Key Claims

The term UFO simply means "Unidentified Flying Object," not necessarily extraterrestrial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:40">[17:34:40]</a>. The US Air Force's Project Blue Book investigated many UFO sightings, cross-checking them with flight records and eliminating the majority of reports in the late 1950s and 1960s as secret military flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:40">[17:53:40]</a>.

Conspiracy theorists like Bob Lazar, who claimed to have worked at [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51|Area 51]] reverse-engineering alien technology powered by "Element 115," have been widely debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:40">[14:20:40]</a>. Lazar's educational background was found to be fabricated, with claims of a fake MIT degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:40">[18:12:40]</a>. Furthermore, when Russian scientists produced "Element 115" (Moscovium) in 2003, it did not exhibit any gravity-creating properties as Lazar described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:40">[19:19:40]</a>.

### Declassification of Documents

In June 2013, the CIA publicly acknowledged the [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51|Area 51]] base and declassified secret details of its history under the Freedom of Information Act, revealing its exact location in the Mojave Desert, Nevada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:40">[19:31:40]</a>. This was followed by the release of 13 million pages of declassified documents online in January 2017, including records of UFO sightings and CIA experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:40">[20:23:40]</a>. In January 2021, thousands more documents on UFOs were declassified, with the agency claiming all records they had on UFOs were now public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:40">[20:34:40]</a>.

Today, the US government uses the term "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" (UAP) instead of UFO due to the latter's association with aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:40">[21:16:40]</a>. In December 2020, the US government directed National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense to release all records on UAPs to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:40">[21:33:40]</a>. The US Pentagon also released three videos in April 2020, acknowledging that leaked videos from 2007 and 2017 were real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:40">[21:52:40]</a>. A UAP Task Force was created in August 2020 to detect, analyze, and catalogue UAPs that could pose a threat to national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:40">[22:03:40]</a>.

While many UAPs have been explained (some as weather balloons), there remain incidents where insufficient data prevents a definitive identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:40">[22:40:40]</a>. It is believed that these unidentified objects are likely part of highly classified programs of various governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:40">[22:55:40]</a>. [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51|Area 51]] continues to be a site for testing next-generation aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:40">[23:02:40]</a>.

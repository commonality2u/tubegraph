On November 24, 1971, a Northwest Orient Airlines flight took off from Portland, Oregon, bound for Seattle, Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This short, 30-minute flight, carrying 36 passengers and 6 crew members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, became the stage for one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in American history involving a hijacker known as [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | DB Cooper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Hijacking Incident

The hijacker, later identified as Dan Cooper, appeared as a normal businessman, dressed in a business suit, white shirt, and black pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He was estimated to be in his mid-forties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> and strategically sat in the last row, seat 18E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Soon after takeoff, Cooper handed a note to air hostess Florence Schaffner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Initially thinking he was flirting, Schaffner kept the note unread until Cooper insisted she read it, stating he had a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The note clearly stated, "Miss, I have a bomb in my briefcase and I want you to sit by me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. To prove his threat, Cooper opened his briefcase, revealing red cylinders, wires, and a large cylindrical battery, confirming it was indeed a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Cooper then made his demands: $200,000 in cash by 5 pm, along with four parachutes (two front, two back), and a fuel truck ready upon landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He warned against any strange actions, threatening to blow up the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Airline's Compliance

Unaware passengers remained oblivious to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Schaffner quietly informed the pilots in the cockpit, and another air hostess, Tina Mucklow, sat with Cooper to maintain communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The news quickly reached Donald Nairob, the airline's president, who made the decision to comply with Cooper's demands to protect the airline's reputation and prevent panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

After coordinating with the FBI, $200,000 in $20 bills was arranged from a Seattle bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Critically, the serial numbers of all 10,000 notes were meticulously recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. To allow time for the arrangements, the pilots were instructed to keep circling Seattle, turning the half-hour flight into a three-hour ordeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Passengers were told the delay was due to minor technical difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

The flight landed at Seattle's airport at 5:46 pm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The plane was parked away from the main terminal, and an airline representative delivered the money and parachutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Cooper then released all passengers and flight attendants, except for Tina Mucklow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The plane was refueled and took off again, with only the pilots, Cooper, and Tina on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## The Jump and Initial Investigation

Cooper began issuing precise instructions for the second flight: towards Mexico City, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, with wings at a 15° angle, and at the slowest possible speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Despite pilots informing him about insufficient fuel for Mexico City, Cooper insisted on these settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

What happened next became legendary: Cooper instructed Tina Mucklow to go to the cockpit and lock the door, leaving him alone in the cabin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Moments later, a warning light indicated the rear staircase had been deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Cooper, utilizing the unique aft staircase of the Boeing 727, jumped out of the plane with the parachutes and the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The cockpit crew, unable to see outside the door, noticed a sudden upward tilt of the plane at 8:13 pm, indicating Cooper's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The plane then proceeded to Reno, Nevada, where it landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Police investigations of the plane found no trace of Cooper, only a tie with a clip, torn parachute parts used to cover the money bag, and personal items like cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | Investigators]] found 66 unidentified fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, but the bomb suitcase, money bag, and parachutes were all missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The FBI's 45-year investigation, which officially closed in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, failed to find Cooper, making it the only unsolved hijacking in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### The DB Cooper Name Mix-up

Interestingly, the hijacker's name was Dan Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The widespread "DB Cooper" name stemmed from a mistake by a news reporter named James Long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Rushing to meet a deadline, Long misheard "Dan Cooper" as "DB Cooper" from a police source and used it in his report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Other journalists picked up the name, and it stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This phenomenon is known in psychology as "Anchoring," a cognitive bias where humans rely too heavily on the first piece of information received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## The Search for Answers

Initially, investigators believed Cooper could not have survived the jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. He jumped from 10,000 feet in pitch darkness at 8 pm, through rain and heavy clouds at 5,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. His business suit was unsuitable for jumping, and wind speeds were estimated at 320 km per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The cold November temperatures of the region, and the potential for hypothermia if he landed in a lake, also pointed to a slim chance of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Survival [[theories_and_suspects_in_the_db_cooper_case | Theories]] and Copycat Hijackings

However, subsequent copycat hijackings after Cooper's incident suggested he might have survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. At least five individuals attempted similar parachute jumps, all surviving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Notably, Martin McNally hijacked a plane on June 24, 1972, using the same modus operandi, demanding $500,000, and jumping at speeds of 400-500 km per hour, yet he survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Richard Lapoint also successfully jumped in January 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Although both were later caught, their survival in worse conditions led the FBI to reconsider Cooper's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Cooper's confident statement to Tina Mucklow that he knew how to use the parachutes further suggested expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### The Money Discovery

The initial search for Cooper focused on a vast area southwest of Washington State, filled with forests, lakes, and canyons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The FBI distributed the serial numbers of the $20 bills to banks and casinos nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. A practical experiment was even conducted, dropping a 91 kg sled from a Boeing 727 to estimate the drop zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Despite extensive land and water searches, including a submarine search in Lake Merwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, nothing was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. An offer of $1,000 for finding a note from the serial numbers yielded no results for three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

A breakthrough came in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Pilot Tom Bohan, who had been flying 4 minutes behind Cooper's plane that night, contacted the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. He recalled the severe storm and claimed the FBI's drop zone calculations were off by 80°, suggesting the search should focus near the Washougal River drainage area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Months later, an 8-year-old boy found $5,800 in $20 bills, some still bundled, on the bank of the Columbia River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The serial numbers confirmed it was part of Cooper's ransom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, validating Bohan's hypothesis as the money was found downstream from the Washougal River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Despite further searches, no body or more money was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

> [!tip] A Reward
> The 8-year-old boy who found the money was given some of the notes as a reward. In 2008, he sold 15 of these $20 notes at an online auction for $37,000, illustrating the enduring public fascination with the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

## [[theories_and_suspects_in_the_db_cooper_case | Theories and Suspects]]

The primary clues to Cooper's identity were the tie and tie clip he left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. In 2009, a research team found microscopic particles on the tie clip, including unalloyed titanium with traces of aluminum and titanium antimony alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. These findings suggested Cooper likely worked in a chemical, metal manufacturing, or aeronautical engineering company, possibly even Boeing itself, as unalloyed titanium was used in aircraft fabrication facilities at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### Facial Sketches and Profile

The FBI created several sketches of Cooper based on witness accounts. The final sketch, released on January 2, 1973, was considered accurate by an air hostess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Larry Carr, who led the investigative team from 2006-2009, theorized Cooper was an aircraft cargo loader in the Air Force, due to their training in parachute use and knowledge of aircraft mechanisms like deploying stairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Based on descriptions, the FBI compiled a list of over 800 suspects, narrowing it down to 20 serious contenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

### Prominent Suspects

*   **Richard McCoy:** A Vietnam War veteran, McCoy hijacked a Boeing 727 five months after Cooper, demanding $500,000 and four parachutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. He deployed the rear stairs and jumped, but was caught two days later and sentenced to 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. The FBI initially considered him Cooper, thinking it was his second attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. A 1991 book, "DB Cooper, The Real McCoy," by former FBI agent Russell Caleme, claimed McCoy's family recognized Cooper's tie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. However, McCoy never admitted or denied being Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. The FBI no longer considers him a suspect due to discrepancies in appearance and evidence placing him in Las Vegas during Cooper's hijacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

*   **Robert Rackstraw:** A Vietnam War veteran, Rackstraw was arrested multiple times for fraud, aircraft theft, and explosives possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. TV producer Thomas Colbert, in his 2016 book "The Last Master Outlaw" and a History Channel documentary, asserted Rackstraw was Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Rackstraw was an initial suspect in the 1970s and made joking comments to the media about being the hijacker, though he later denied these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. His face matched the sketches, but the FBI dropped him as a suspect after 1979 due to insufficient evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Colbert believed the FBI should have continued investigating him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. The FBI officially closed the Cooper case on July 12, 2016, the day after Colbert's book launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Rackstraw passed away from natural causes in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

## Unresolved Questions and Legacy

The mystery of [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | DB Cooper]] remains unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. No one knows his true identity, where he came from, or what became of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. While many similar hijackings followed, where hijackers survived and were caught, Cooper remains the unique exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. The case continues to fascinate the public, sparking endless [[theories_and_suspects_in_the_db_cooper_case | theories and suspects in the DB Cooper case]].

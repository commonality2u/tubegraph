Before its independence in 1971, Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan, while present-day Pakistan was West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46">[01:46]</a>. During this period, East Pakistan faced significant social, linguistic, economic, and political discrimination from West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>.

In East Pakistan, the majority of the population spoke Bengali, with less than 10% speaking Urdu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00">[02:00]</a>. Despite this, West Pakistan attempted to impose the Urdu language on East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06">[02:06]</a>.

## [[economic_and_political_disparities_between_east_and_west_pakistan | Economic Disparities]]

Economic discrimination was rampant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11">[02:11]</a>. East Pakistan contributed 59% of the country's exports but received only 25% of industrial investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13">[02:13]</a>.

Further exacerbating economic hardship, in November 1970, Cyclone Bhola struck East Pakistan, resulting in an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20">[02:20]</a>, making it one of the deadliest tropical cyclones in the last century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>. Despite the catastrophic impact, West Pakistan made limited efforts to provide relief to the affected population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38">[02:38]</a>.

## Political Discrimination and the Path to Independence

Political discrimination was also evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43">[02:43]</a>. In the 1970 elections, East Pakistan held 162 seats, while West Pakistan had 138 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46">[02:46]</a>. While voters in West Pakistan were split among different political parties, the Awami League Party, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, received an overwhelming majority of votes in East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55">[02:55]</a>.

According to the election results, the Awami League was supposed to govern both East and West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>. However, the West Pakistani military, under Commander-in-Chief Yahya Khan, refused to accept the election outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08">[03:08]</a>.

Martial law was subsequently imposed on East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[03:17]</a>. In response, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman initiated a civil disobedience movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[03:20]</a>. Concurrently, the West Pakistani military committed widespread atrocities, including genocide, against the people of East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30">[03:30]</a>. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35">[03:35]</a>, hundreds of thousands of people were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37">[03:37]</a>, and approximately 10 million people sought refuge in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>, with about 50% of East Pakistan's population becoming internally displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44">[03:44]</a>.

These events directly led to the [[bangladesh_liberation_war_and_its_causes | Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971]], during which India assisted Bangladesh in gaining its freedom under the leadership of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>.

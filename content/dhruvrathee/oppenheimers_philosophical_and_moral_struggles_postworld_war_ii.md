J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb, faced profound philosophical and moral struggles following the use of the nuclear weapons he helped create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:14">[01:51:14]</a>.

## Initial Reactions and Reflections

Upon witnessing the first nuclear test, codenamed Trinity, Oppenheimer was deeply shocked by the immense power of the explosion, which was 50 times more dangerous than he had anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This experience led him to utter a line from the Bhagavad Gita, a text he had studied in its original Sanskrit and considered one of the most influential books of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:54">[01:56:54]</a>:

> "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">[01:44:44]</a>

Initially, Oppenheimer expressed happiness after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, having wished it could be used against Nazi Germany and Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. However, the subsequent bombing of Nagasaki deeply shocked him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Calls for Nuclear Weapon Ban

Just three days after the Nagasaki bombing, Oppenheimer traveled to Washington on August 17 to meet the Secretary of War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He hand-delivered a letter directly stating his desire to ban nuclear weapons and expressed profound regret for his part in creating the technology handed to humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:14">[01:51:14]</a>. He viewed the first bomb on Hiroshima as a "necessary evil" but feared what different countries would do with this technology in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:14">[01:52:14]</a>.

## Confrontation with President Truman

Two months after the Nagasaki bombing, Oppenheimer met President Harry Truman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:43">[01:54:43]</a>. During this meeting, Oppenheimer famously stated, "I have blood on my hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:43">[01:54:43]</a>. This declaration angered President Truman, who then ordered his secretary to remove Oppenheimer from his office, stating he never wanted to see him again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:43">[01:54:43]</a>.

## Post-War Efforts and Opposition

Oppenheimer subsequently worked with the US Atomic Energy Commission to prevent further nuclear attacks and sought to establish control over nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. When President Truman proposed the development of a hydrogen bomb in 1949, Oppenheimer strongly opposed the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>.

Despite his opposition, America proceeded to develop the hydrogen bomb, conducting tests in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:28">[02:00:28]</a>. Due to his resistance and his perceived [[personal_philosophies_and_influence_of_media | left-wing ideology]], Oppenheimer's job was taken from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>. He spent the remainder of his life in academia, delivering lectures globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>.

His profound moral and philosophical struggles, evident in his efforts to control and ban nuclear weapons, left a lasting impact on his life and legacy.

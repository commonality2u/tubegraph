The Mona Lisa, painted by [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1503 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, is considered the world's most famous painting, valued at nearly $1 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Da Vinci himself was a polymath, excelling as an engineer, scientist, sculptor, architect, and theorist with knowledge spanning subjects like painting, cartography, astronomy, anatomy, and palaeontology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## [[the_identity_and_background_of_the_woman_in_the_mona_lisa | Identity of the Subject]]

The [[the_identity_and_background_of_the_woman_in_the_mona_lisa | identity of the woman]] in the painting has long been a subject of curiosity and debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Early Theories and Naming
The first revelation about her identity came from [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Italian artist Giorgio Vasari]] in 1550, who wrote [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Leonardo da Vinci's]] autobiography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. According to Vasari, the woman was Lisa Gherardini, wife of Florence silk trader Francesco Giocondo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This belief is the origin of the painting's names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>:

*   **Mona Lisa:** Derived from "Madonna Lisa," where "Madonna" meant "Madam" in Italian, later shortened to "Monna" and then "Mona" in English. Thus, Mona Lisa means "Madam Lisa" or "Lady Lisa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **La Gioconda:** After marriage, Lisa Gherardini became Lisa Giocondo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. "Giocondo" in Italian means "light-hearted" or "cheerful," linking to the painting's famous smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. In French, it is known as "La Joconde" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Alternative Theories and Modern Confirmation
Despite Vasari's account, many theories emerged about the woman's [[the_identity_and_background_of_the_woman_in_the_mona_lisa | identity]], suggesting she could be [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Leonardo da Vinci's]] mother, an Italian queen, or even a self-portrait of [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Da Vinci]] in female form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Artist Lilian Schwartz promoted the self-portrait theory in 1987, using digital tools to highlight perceived similarities between [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Da Vinci's]] face and the Mona Lisa's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

However, modern research largely confirms the [[the_identity_and_background_of_the_woman_in_the_mona_lisa | identity of the woman]] as Lisa Giocondo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. A Florence professor spent 25 years researching archives, discovering clear evidence in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. He found that the [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Da Vinci]] family had a close relationship with the Giocondo family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Lisa's marriage was registered on March 5, 1495, when she was 16 and Francesco about 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Professor Pallanti suggests that Lisa was 24 when the portrait was painted, possibly commissioned to celebrate their new home in 1503 or the birth of their second son in December 1502 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The latter reason is more probable, as Lisa had lost her daughter three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The veil over Lisa's hair is believed by many to be a mourning veil, worn after a family loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Artistic Techniques and Mysteries]]

The Mona Lisa's uniqueness stems from several [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | artistic techniques]] and features:

*   **Medium:** It was painted on poplar wood, a favored medium for Italian painters of that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Size:** The painting is relatively small, measuring only 77 cm by 53 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Half-Length Portrait:** It was one of the first paintings in Italy to focus so closely on the person, using a half-length portrait style, which was uncommon at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Coloration:** The painting's dull, yellowish appearance today is due to a varnish layer applied for moisture protection and natural bleaching over time. It was originally brighter and more colorful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### The Mystery of the Smile: Sfumato and Optics
[[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Da Vinci]] used the special painting style known as Sfumato, a blending technique, to create the mysterious smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. By blurring outlines and blending colors, he made the background landscape (the Arno Valley in Italy) merge seamlessly with Mona Lisa, even blending her hair with the scenery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

The mysterious smile appears to change based on where the viewer focuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>:
*   Looking directly at the smile makes it appear serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   Looking into her eyes or elsewhere in the painting makes her appear to smile more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This effect also persists in peripheral vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

[[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Da Vinci]] dedicated significant time to perfecting the smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. He performed dissections of human and even horse faces in a Florence hospital to study facial muscles and nerves, seeking to understand how they produce a smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. His research into optics revealed that light spreads across the retina, with the fovea (center) seeing fine details and the rest of the retina picking up shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. He utilized this knowledge to focus shadows, creating the persistent smile effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## The "Two Mona Lisas" Theory

A notable theory suggests the existence of two Mona Lisa paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Raphael's Sketch
In 1504, artist Raphael made a sketch featuring two columns behind Mona Lisa, unlike the Louvre version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Initially dismissed, this theory was disproved by a German art historian in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Professor Pallanti confirmed that Raphael lived across from the Giocondo family, suggesting he might have been inspired by another painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### The Isleworth Mona Lisa
A second Mona Lisa painting was revealed in 1914 by novelist John R. Eyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This "new" Mona Lisa is 3.5 inches longer and 5 inches wider than the Louvre version and features two columns in the background, matching Raphael's sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30>[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

Key differences between the two paintings include:

### The Isleworth Theories
Experts have since theorized that [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Leonardo da Vinci]] worked on two Mona Lisas simultaneously, with the Isleworth version being his first experimental attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. In 2010, the Mona Lisa Foundation investigated the Isleworth painting, proposing that while [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Da Vinci]] painted the face and hands, an inferior artist (perhaps from his workshop) completed the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Both theories remain debated due to a lack of solid evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## Transfer to France and [[the_role_of_the_theft_in_increasing_the_fame_of_the_mona_lisa | The Role of Theft in Fame]]

In 1516, King Francis I of France invited [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Leonardo da Vinci]] to live in France, and [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Da Vinci]] took the Mona Lisa with him, possibly still unfinished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Upon [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Da Vinci's]] death in 1519, the king retained the painting in his Royal Collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. In 1797, during the French Revolution, it was moved to the Louvre Museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The painting's fame significantly increased only after its [[the_theft_of_the_mona_lisa_in_1911 | theft in 1911]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Before this incident, while known to art enthusiasts, it was not widely recognized by the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The mastermind behind the theft, Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian Nationalist and Louvre employee, believed the painting belonged in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

After two years of hiding the painting, Peruggia attempted to sell it to art dealer Giovanni Poggi in Florence, leading to his capture and a six-month prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. The painting was returned to the Louvre on January 4, 1914, where it is now displayed behind bulletproof glass in strictly climate-controlled conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This event significantly contributed to the Mona Lisa's enduring global popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

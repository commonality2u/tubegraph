This article explores the nature of epic narratives, specifically the Ramayana, analyzing how later additions and literary devices like metaphor and exaggeration contribute to differing [[historical_interpretations_and_biases | interpretations]] of historical and mythological events.

## Allegations and the Uttar Kand: A Later Addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

Allegations against Lord Ram, such as abandoning his pregnant wife Sita and killing a Shudra named Shambuk for meditating, are discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These points were notably mentioned by Dr. Ambedkar in his booklet, *Riddles of Ram and Krishna* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

However, these specific incidents are part of the *Uttar Kand*, which is considered a later addition to the original Valmiki's Ramayana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### The Original Ending: Valmiki's Ramayana (Yuddha Kand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

The original story of Valmiki's Ramayana concludes in Chapter 128 of the sixth section, the Yuddha Kand, which serves as a "happily ever after" ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

In this section, Ram is crowned king, Vibhishan returns to Lanka, and Sugreev returns to Kishkindha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Bharat is appointed as Prince Regent after Lakshman's refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Shlokas 95 to 106 describe Ram's kingdom, characterized by prosperity and harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>:
*   Ram performs various rituals like Paundarika, Ashvamedha, and Vajapeya, pleasing the Gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Absence of dangers, diseases, thieves, or dacoits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   People live for thousands of years, free from disease or sorrow, with elders not performing last rites for the young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Nature flourishes with regular fruits, flowers, timely rain, and blissful winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   All societal sections (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra) perform their duties, satisfied and without greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Shloka 106 states that everyone possessed distinct qualities and behaved ethically, leading to Ram's reign lasting 10,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The original epic concludes with the Phalashruti section, which outlines the benefits of listening to the scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Shloka 108 in this section confirms the scripture's completion as "written at first by Valmiki" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Contradictions Introduced by the Uttar Kand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

The Uttar Kand contradicts descriptions found in the main Valmiki Ramayana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>:
*   **Shambuk's Story**: The story of Shambuk's killing, which involves a Brahmin's son dying and causing grief, directly contradicts the description of Ram Rajya where no young people died before their elders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Pushpak Viman**: In the Uttar Kand, Ram uses the Pushpak Viman to search for Shambuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. However, Valmiki's Ramayana states that Ram returned the Pushpak Viman to Kuber after returning to Ayodhya (Yuddha Kand, Chapter 127) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Treatment of Messengers**: Uttar Kand (Chapter 13) describes Ravan killing Kuber's messenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This contradicts Vibhishan's advice to Ravan in Valmiki's Sundarkand (Chapter 52, Shloka 15), where he lists punishments for messengers but explicitly states that killing a messenger is unheard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

These contradictions suggest that the Uttar Kand was a later, inauthentic addition that negates the original narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. It is speculated that this addition was made to promote Brahmanical superiority and casteism, as well as patriarchy through Sita's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## [[metaphorical_and_literal_interpretations_of_the_ramayana | Metaphorical and Exaggerated Interpretations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>

The speaker emphasizes that while the Ramayana is a religious scripture, historical evidence for the literal occurrence of all its events is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Valmiki's Ramayana is estimated to have been written between the 7th and 4th centuries BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. It is suggested that the epic is metaphorical, with events perhaps occurring differently than described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Metaphorical Language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>

Many seemingly impossible feats in the Ramayana, such as Lord Hanuman picking up a mountain and flying across the sea, are likely metaphors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Examples from common language illustrate this:
*   Saying someone is "carrying a mountain on their shoulders" signifies hard work, not a literal act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   "I will cross the seven oceans for you" expresses deep commitment, not a literal journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

This [[metaphorical_and_literal_interpretations_of_the_ramayana | interpretation]] extends to miracles in other Abrahamic religions as well, such as Jesus turning water into wine or Prophet Muhammad splitting the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. These are seen as mythological stories that lack scientific or historical basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. For instance, "splitting the moon" could symbolize breaking centuries-old traditions, and "swallowing the sun" could represent controlling fire or overcoming nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Exaggeration (Atishayokti Alankar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>

Writers and poets often use exaggeration, known as *Atishayokti Alankar*, to describe real events in a larger-than-life or more entertaining way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

*   **Battle of Thermopylae (Film '300')**: The Hollywood film '300' depicts 300 Spartans fighting against 1 million Persians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. While the battle was historic and Greeks fought bravely, historical evidence suggests a Greek army of 7,000-10,000 soldiers aiding the Spartans against 70,000-300,000 Persians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This highlights a significant, disproportionate battle exaggerated for narrative effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Maharana Pratap's Armor**: An India Today article states Maharana Pratap carried a spear weighing 80 kg, two swords totaling 208 kg, and armor weighing 72 kg, summing to 360 kg in battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This is a physical impossibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The actual weight of his armor and weapons displayed in the City Palace Museum in Udaipur is 35 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

These examples demonstrate how historical figures and events are often embellished in narratives to emphasize their greatness or dramatic impact.

## The Essence of Ram: Beyond Literalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>

Regardless of whether Ram was a divine avatar, a human, or a literary character, his greatness stems from his qualities and the values he promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. These values, such as humility, compassion, and strength, are applicable to everyone, irrespective of their religious or non-religious beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the "name of Ram is greater than Ram" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. The true essence lies in recalling and applying his values in daily life, transforming one's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

### Protecting Ram from Misinterpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

The speaker notes a trend where some individuals use Ram's name to promote harmful agendas, such as bullying, abusing women, and inciting violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This includes forcing others to chant "Jai Shri Ram" and committing acts of violence, such as lynchings, in his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

This misuse of religious slogans parallels the perversion of phrases like "Allahu Akbar" by extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. The true meaning of religious texts, which promote values like non-violence (Ahimsa Parmodharam) and helping others (Parhitsaris Dharm Nahi Bhai), is ignored in favor of ego and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. The speaker challenges those who promote hatred in Ram's name to find validating Shlokas in Valmiki's Ramayana, suggesting they may not even be able to read the scripture themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

To combat this, it is crucial for individuals to read religious scriptures themselves to understand the inherent values and prevent manipulation in the name of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This struggle highlights the ongoing [[controversies_surrounding_rams_character_in_the_Ramayana | controversies surrounding Ram's character]] and his legacy in modern society.

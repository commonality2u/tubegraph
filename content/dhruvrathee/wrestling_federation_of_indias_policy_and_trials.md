The [[Controversy and Criticism Involving Wrestling Federation of India WFI | Wrestling Federation of India (WFI)]] has faced scrutiny regarding its policies, management, and the welfare of athletes, including accusations of unfair practices and a desire for absolute control over wrestlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

## Accusations of Cheating and Control
There have been allegations that the WFI has engaged in "cheating" through its policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, particularly concerning trials and athlete management. The WFI's actions suggest a desire by politicians to exert total control over athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Control over Support Staff and NGOs
The WFI has shown issues with foreign coaches, despite their significant contributions to wrestlers' success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Coaches like Woller Akos (for Vinesh Phogat) and Shako Bentindis (for Bajrang Punia) were instrumental in honing skills, motivation, and technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. These foreign coaches were often brought in by sports NGOs like Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ) and JSW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

However, the WFI instructed these NGOs to stop their "interference," claiming they were "spoiling" the wrestlers and that the WFI could manage its own athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This stance was contradicted by the lack of dedicated support, such as a physiotherapist for Vinesh Phogat during the Tokyo Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. In November 2021, JSW and OGQ were mandated to involve the WFI in any contracts with wrestlers, a policy enforced under then-chief Brij Bhushan Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

## Controversial Policy Changes Regarding Trials
The WFI implemented a highly controversial policy change, stating that even after a wrestler secured an Olympic quota, they could still be subjected to a trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This rule included a stipulation that a trial would only be held if the WFI deemed it necessary, otherwise it could be skipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### The Case of Vinesh Phogat and Antim Panghal
This policy directly impacted Vinesh Phogat's path to the Olympics. Initially, the Ad Hoc Committee assured that a trial would be held for the quota winner in the 53 kg category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. However, on May 21st, they suddenly announced that there would be no trial, calling it a "one-time-only exemption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

This decision was made after Antim Panghal secured the quota in the 53 kg category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Had the trials proceeded, Vinesh Phogat, who finished in the top four in the 53 kg category trials in March, might have defeated Antim and competed in that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. The WFI's decision to forgo the trials in the 53 kg category was seen by Vinesh as a way to deny her the opportunity to compete in that weight class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This led Vinesh to compete in the 50 kg category trials as well, ensuring her qualification for the Paris Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Aftermath and Calls for Transparency
The WFI's actions have raised questions about transparency in its rules and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Despite the challenges, [[Struggles and Challenges Faced by Vinesh Phogat | Vinesh Phogat]] continued to advocate for making Indian wrestling a safer environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. There is a continuous call for solutions to ensure sportspersons receive proper facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

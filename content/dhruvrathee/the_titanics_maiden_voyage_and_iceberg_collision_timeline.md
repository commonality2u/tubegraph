The incident of the RMS Titanic occurred on April 10, 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The RMS Titanic was considered the world's largest and most luxurious ship of its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Maiden Voyage Begins
The Titanic set out on its first voyage from Southampton, England, destined for New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Aboard were diverse passengers, including renowned industrialists, actors, and immigrants seeking a better life in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The ship was commanded by 62-year-old Senior Captain Edward John Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. There was significant excitement surrounding the ship among passengers, the public, and the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The "Unsinkable" Ship
The Titanic was approximately 269 meters in length and over 53 meters high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Its luxury was awe-inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The construction cost was $7.5 million at the time, equivalent to $400 million today when adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The interior facilities and decorations surpassed those of a five-star hotel, featuring stained glass mirrors, ornate wood paneling, two grand staircases, a heated swimming pool, a Turkish bath, an electric bath, a gym, a squash court, four restaurants, two barber shops, and a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Due to the [[safety_measures_and_failures_on_the_titanic | safety features]] used in its construction, the Titanic was widely believed to be "unsinkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The Vice President of White Star Line, the company that built the ship, publicly declared it unsinkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Initial Ice Warnings
Two days into its maiden voyage, on April 12, 1912, the Titanic began receiving its first ice warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The Atlantic Ocean route was "replete with ice," including icebergs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Ships often communicate through radio to warn nearby vessels about ice in their vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. After these initial warnings, the Titanic changed its course twice to avoid danger but did not reduce its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, continuing at 21.5 knots (40 km/hr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## The Night of Collision (April 14, 1912)
On April 14, 1912, the Titanic received seven more ice warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. However, Captain Smith and his crew reportedly ignored these warnings and did not slow the ship's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. That night, visibility was low as there was no moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

At 11:39 PM, Fredrick Fleet, a lookout in the crow's nest (a high platform used for spotting obstructions), spotted a huge iceberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. He immediately rang the bell three times to alert those below and called the officers on the bridge, screaming about the iceberg and the need for immediate steering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. First Officer William signaled the engine room to steer the ship to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Collision
Unfortunately, it was too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Just one minute later, at 11:40 PM, the Titanic collided with the iceberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The iceberg, estimated to be 200x400 feet long (the size of a football field) and as tall as the crow's nest, weighed approximately 1.5 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The ship's front right side, specifically near the bow, grazed against the iceberg for about 10 seconds, forming a huge dent and creating small holes in the main body of the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## The Realization of Doom
Seconds after the collision, Captain Smith and architect Thomas Andrews arrived at the site to assess the damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. They quickly realized the ship would sink, a shocking revelation for a vessel considered "unsinkable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The belief in the Titanic's unsinkability stemmed from two primary [[safety_measures_and_failures_on_the_titanic | safety features]]:
1.  **Double Bottom Hull**: The ship had two layers in its hull, designed so that if the bottom layer was damaged, the second could save the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. However, the collision was on the side, which only had a single layer, rendering the double bottom useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
2.  **Watertight Compartments**: The hull was divided into 16 separate watertight compartments. The ship was designed to stay afloat even if 4 of these compartments filled with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The iceberg's impact, however, breached 6 of the 16 compartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, exceeding the limit and ensuring the ship would sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Distress Calls and Rescue Efforts
At 12:00 AM (20 minutes after the collision), Captain Smith ordered his crew to send a distress call via radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Senior radio operator Jack Phillips began sending distress signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

Twenty minutes later, at 12:20 AM, the RMS Carpathia, a ship 107 km away, detected the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Its operator spoke to the Titanic and set course to assist, but it would take 3.5 hours to reach the Titanic at top speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Meanwhile, Titanic crew members lit flares and rockets in the sky, hoping to attract other nearby ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Unfortunately, no other ships responded besides the Carpathia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Evacuation and Sinking
Captain Smith ordered the evacuation of passengers using the lifeboats, prioritizing women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Initially, most passengers remained calm, believing the Titanic was unsinkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The first lifeboat, with a capacity for 65 people, was lowered with only 28 aboard, leaving it half-empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

As compartments filled with water and the ship began to tilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, passengers gradually realized the ship was indeed sinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Chaos and panic ensued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. By 1:00 AM, so much water had filled the front compartments that the bow of the ship submerged, causing the rear part to surface and its propellers to emerge from the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

A critical issue was the scarcity of lifeboats; there were only 20, capable of accommodating approximately 1,200 people, while around 2,200 were aboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. At 2:05 AM, the last lifeboat was lowered, leaving 1,500 people still onboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Some fought for a place, while others accepted their fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

According to eyewitnesses, the ship broke into two halves at around 2:20 AM and slowly sank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The "unsinkable" ship sank in less than three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Of the 1,500 remaining people, most either drowned or died from hypothermia in the -2 degrees Celsius water within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Captain Edward Smith reportedly stayed at the wheel until the end and drowned with the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The RMS Carpathia arrived between 3:30 and 4:00 AM, about an hour too late to save those in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Aftermath and Controversies
The [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | disaster of the Titanic]] raised many questions and controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. A key revelation was the presence of another ship, the SS Californian, just 37 km away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

One hour before the Titanic's collision, the SS Californian had issued the last iceberg warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. However, at 11:15 PM, the Californian's radio operator switched off the radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The Californian had stopped for the night due to the danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, and thus did not receive the Titanic's distress signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Passengers on the Titanic's deck could even see the Californian on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Despite seeing the rockets fired from the Titanic after 12:00 AM, Captain Stanley Lord of the Californian insisted they were not distress signals but flares from a party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Had he taken them seriously, many lives could have been saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. When the Californian switched its radio back on the next morning, it received the SOS calls and reached the site, only to find dead bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Inquiries blamed Captain Lord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Other Contributing Factors
Beyond Captain Lord, several other factors contributed to the disaster:
*   **Insufficient Lifeboats**: The company had not provided enough lifeboats, believing them unnecessary for an "unsinkable" ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Cancelled Safety Drills**: Captain Smith canceled a planned safety drill on the day of the collision, deeming it unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Steering Error**: Steersman Robert Hichens, at the wheel, panicked when the iceberg alarm sounded and mistakenly steered the ship to the right (towards the iceberg) instead of the instructed left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Full Speed Despite Warnings**: The British inquiry found that despite numerous iceberg warnings, the ship continued at full speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. A popular theory suggests that Joseph Bruce, the chairman and managing director of White Star Line, pressured Captain Smith to maintain speed to set a record for completing the voyage in six days, showcasing the Titanic as the fastest ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. It is claimed that on April 14 at 2:00 PM, Joseph even pocketed an ice warning from Captain Smith to prevent the crew from slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Legacy and Regulations
The Titanic disaster forever changed the shipping industry worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Many new regulations and standards were established to prevent future disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. In 1914, an International Ice Patrol was created to warn ships about icebergs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) treaty was signed, setting new safety standards for ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This included a lifeboat regulation, mandating a sufficient number of lifeboats for every passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Discovery of the Wreckage
It took over 70 years to find the Titanic's wreckage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. In September 1985, American ocean explorer Robert Ballard and a French oceanographer located the Titanic 3,800 meters (3.8 km) under the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The wreckage was found in two separate pieces, 600 meters apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Today, the underwater environment, specifically bacteria and other organisms, are eroding the ship's metal framework, and it is expected to completely disintegrate by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## Titanic II Project
Even after 110 years, fascination with the Titanic persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. In 2012, Australian billionaire Clive Palmer planned to build "Titanic 2," an exact replica of the original, intended to sail the same route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Though initially projected for completion in 2016, the project has faced delays and remains unfinished by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. It is believed that a lack of public interest, due to the absence of modern amenities like TV or Wi-Fi in an exact replica, might be a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

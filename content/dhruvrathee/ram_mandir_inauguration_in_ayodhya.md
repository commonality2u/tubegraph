On January 22, 2024, the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was inaugurated with a 'Praan Prathistha' ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. 'Praan' means life, and 'Pratistha' means establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, signifying the ceremony where an idol is installed inside a temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This event garnered extensive media attention and was a subject of widespread discussion and [[controversies_around_ram_temple_pran_prathistha_ceremony | controversies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The video also discusses the [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | qualities of Shri Ram]] as a core theme, highlighting that understanding these values is more important than simply talking about Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Previous videos by the speaker have touched upon justifications for [[temples_and_worship_of_ravan_in_india | Ravana]] and allegations against Ram, such as the killing of Shambhuk and the abandonment of Sita, often citing evidence that [[the_addition_of_uttar_kand_to_the_original_ramayana | the Uttar Kaand is a later addition to the Ramayana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Attendance and Absences

### Prominent Figures Not Attending

*   **L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi**: Key leaders of the Ram Mandir Agitation Movement since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, they did not attend due to age considerations, as stated by the Ram Temple Trust general secretary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Bollywood Celebrities**: Figures like Katrina Kaif, Rohit Shetty, Ranbir Kapoor, and Alia Bhatt received special invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### [[political_reactions_to_the_ram_mandir_event | Political Reactions]]

Many [[political_reactions_to_the_ram_mandir_event | political parties]] and individuals rejected invitations for various reasons:
*   **CPI(M)**: General secretary Sitaram Yechury stated that religion is a personal matter and the government should not affiliate with any particular religion, rejecting the invitation on grounds of secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction)**: Uddhav Thackeray received an invitation via speed post just two days before the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. His party member Sanjay Raut criticized the BJP for "ruling like Ravan" despite worshipping Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Thackeray instead visited the Kalaram Temple in Nashik, believed to be where Lord Rama, Lakshman, and Sita stayed during their exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Congress Party**: Many leaders rejected the invitation, citing that the temple was being inaugurated while still partially completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Their primary reason was the accusation that the BJP was [[political_reactions_to_the_ram_mandir_event | politicizing the event]] and using Ram's name for electoral gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Shankaracharyas' Non-Attendance

The four principal Shankaracharyas, heads of the four mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya about 1,200 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, did not attend the inauguration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

*   **Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati (Puri)**: Stated that the ceremony was not in accordance with Hindu scriptures and lacked proper procedure for idol installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Shankaracharya Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati (Uttarakhand)**: Explained that a temple is considered the body of God, and its peak (eyes), pot (head), and flag (hair) were not yet complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Bringing life into an incomplete body goes against scriptures, prompting his non-attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

#### Defamation Against Shankaracharyas
Following their decision, the Shankaracharyas faced relentless defamation campaigns on social media, with fake news targeting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Fake News: Visit to Ajmer Sharif**: Accounts spread false photos claiming Shankaracharya Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati visited Ajmer Sharif, labeling him anti-Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   **Clarification**: Adi Shankaracharya's philosophy of non-duality states that God is everywhere, making distinctions between religions irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. More importantly, the news was false; the photo was from a Hindu Ashram, Ramdev Pir's court, considered a Krishna avatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The Shankaracharya himself confirmed he had never visited Ajmer city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Fake News: Accepted â‚¹500,000**: Another baseless claim alleged they took money to reject the invitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

The speaker notes that public opposition to the BJP or PM Modi's decisions often leads to defamation and insult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Qualities of Lord Ram

The video contrasts the common understanding of "great" kings with the [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | qualities of Shri Ram]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. While figures like Alexander the Great are glorified despite being bloodthirsty and ruthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, Ram's character offers a different lesson.

When Ram was about to be crowned king, his stepmother Kaikeyi demanded that her son Bharat be king and Ram be exiled for 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Composure and Lack of Anger**: Valmiki's Ramayana, Ayodhya Kand, Chapter 18, Shloka 41, states that Ram was not upset despite Kaikeyi's harsh words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Chapter 19, Shloka 1, notes he did not get angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. He remained unruffled, consoled his father Dashratha, and assured Kaikeyi he would go into exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Selfless View of Power**: Ram chose exile calmly, desiring to live like a sage and abide in righteousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. For him, power was not about personal gain but about serving the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Humility, Compassion, and Forgiveness**: Ram held no ill feelings towards Kaikeyi. His only complaint was that she didn't trust him enough to tell him directly about her wish to crown Bharat, instead involving King Dasharatha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

The video concludes by posing a question about true victory: is it gaining power by sacrificing morality, or losing power while preserving one's values and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>?

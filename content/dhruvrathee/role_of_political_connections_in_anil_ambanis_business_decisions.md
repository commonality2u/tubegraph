Anil Ambani's business strategy often leveraged political connections, a stark contrast to his brother Mukesh Ambani's more operations-focused approach. This reliance on political ties, while initially beneficial, eventually contributed to his business struggles and downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Early Role and Reliance on Government Lobbying

From the outset, Anil Ambani's role within Reliance included public relations, corporate affairs, and crucial **lobbying with the government** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This function was vital for the company's growth, ensuring good relationships with politicians and bureaucrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

The Ambani family, including their father Dhirubhai Ambani, had a history of close ties with politicians, though Dhirubhai reportedly maintained good relations with all politicians without favoring any specific one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Close Ties with Samajwadi Party

Anil Ambani became notably close to the Samajwadi Party, particularly Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This closeness was a source of discomfort for Mukesh Ambani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. In June 2004, Anil Ambani successfully filed a Rajya Sabha nomination as an independent candidate from Uttar Pradesh, aided by Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

This political alignment was seen as problematic by Mukesh, especially since the Samajwadi Party was a main rival to the Congress, which had recently formed the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Mukesh believed that Anil's close association with an opposition party was detrimental to Reliance's business interests, as it might displease the Congress government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Business Decisions Influenced by Political Connections

Anil Ambani's political connections directly influenced several key business decisions:

*   **Dadri Power Project**: Mukesh Ambani was unhappy with Anil's plan to start a gas-based electricity power plant in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh. Mukesh believed Anil had "forced this project on Reliance" solely to "please Amar Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This project required land, and in 2004, the Mulayam Singh Yadav government used an emergency provision to transfer land to Anil Ambani, ignoring the farmers who owned it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. This decision was later overturned by the Allahabad High Court in 2009, ruling in favor of the farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Government Intervention in Family Feud**: The public feud between [[the_ambani_brothers_feud_and_its_impact_on_their_empire | the Ambani brothers]] became so intense that Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and even Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh (though the PMO later denied it) had to intervene, stating that the entire country was suffering due to their conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Gas Wars**: In the legal battle over gas pricing, Anil Ambani accused the UPA government, particularly the Petroleum Ministry, of favoring Mukesh Ambani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. He claimed the government was pushing companies like ONGC into losses to benefit Mukesh and even published front-page newspaper ads accusing the government and the Petroleum Ministry of working to benefit Mukesh at the cost of the government treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The Supreme Court eventually ruled that gas was a government property and only the government could decide its price, not the Ambanis, a judgment that significantly impacted Anil financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

## Accusations of Political Pressure

Anil Ambani explicitly claimed that Mukesh was "trying to harm him by putting political pressure on him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. He pointed to instances where his company's bids for projects were unsuccessful despite being the highest bidder:

*   **Airport Privatization**: Anil's company was the highest bidder for the privatization of Delhi and Mumbai airports, but the contract was awarded to the second-highest bidder due to an alleged "significant conflict of interest." Anil claimed Mukesh Ambani was behind this decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Coal-Based Methane Contracts**: Similar issues arose with coal-based methane extraction contracts, further solidifying Anil's belief that Mukesh was using political influence to undermine his businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Consequences of Over-Reliance on Political Connections

Anil Ambani's approach often involved "getting funding for projects from public sector banks using political connections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. However, this strategy faced significant challenges after the 2008 global financial crisis, when public sector banks became less willing to fund power and infrastructure sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

His businesses, described as "cash-hungry businesses that needed innovation and investment constantly," lacked a continuous cash flow from core businesses like Mukesh's oil and gas ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. As a result, when external funding, often secured through political influence, stopped, his debts escalated, leading to [[anil_ambanis_business_struggles_and_debts | Anil Ambani's business struggles and debts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

Ultimately, Anil Ambani's strategic decisions, while initially aided by political connections and ambition, were not robust enough to withstand changing market dynamics and increased scrutiny, leading to his financial decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

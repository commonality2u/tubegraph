The history and administration of the Mughal Empire are often subjects of contemporary political discourse in India, particularly regarding the relationship between Hindu and Muslim communities during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Historians like Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib, and Audrey Truschke are sometimes criticized for their perspectives on this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Emperor Aurangzeb's Rule

[[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] is frequently portrayed as a Muslim fanatic who oppressed Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. During his rule, many Hindu temples were indeed demolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, and the policy of coexistence from Akbar's rule was gradually phased out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. In 1665, [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] increased customs duty on Hindu traders to double that of Muslim traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, and two years later, he abolished customs duty for Muslims entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Orders for demolishing Hindu temples were issued to establish Islam "properly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Historians Irfan Habib and Audrey Truschke confirm that [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] demolished temples in Mathura and Varanasi to build mosques and targeted important temples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. He also imposed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, a policy not followed by Akbar, Jahangir, or Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

However, historical records also present a more nuanced picture:
*   In 1654, [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] sent an order to Rana Raj Singh of Mewar, a Hindu Rajput king, stating that rulers should ensure peace and prosperity for subjects of every religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. He criticized bigotry and destruction of places of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   After declaring himself emperor in 1658, [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] issued an order in 1659 to Banaras, forbidding harm to Brahmins or Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   In 1687, he ordered the construction of homes for pious Brahmins and holy fakirs at a ghat in Banaras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   In the 1680s, he participated in religious discussions with Hindu saints like Shiv Mangaldas Maharaj, showering them with gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   In 1691, he granted tax-free land and eight villages to Mahant Balak Das Nirvani to support a Balaji temple in Chitrakoot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] also gave lands for temple construction or encouraged it in Allahabad, Vrindavan, and Bihar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   Jain pilgrimage sites in Gujarat, such as Shatrunjaya, Girnar, and Mount Abu, received land grants from [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] in the late 1650s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### Hindu Participation in Mughal Administration
Contrary to common narratives, Hindus held significant positions within [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]]'s administration.
*   [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]]'s chief diwan was a Hindu, Raja Raghunath Ray, whom [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] praised as his greatest administrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Hindu participation in elite levels of Mughal administration increased by 50% under [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   Hindus constituted 31.6% of the Mughal nobility (Nawabs and Nizams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   In 1679, there were around 72 Rajput mansabdars and 96 Maratha mansabdars under [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]], with Marathas making up one-fifth of the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Comparison to Modern Politics
Eminent historian Harbans Mukhia has called Narendra Modi a "modern parallel of [[aurangzeb_and_shivaji_maharaj | Aurangzeb]]" due to similarities such as both being born in Gujarat, presenting themselves as holy figures, and exhibiting both [[communalism_versus_secularism_in_indian_history | communal]] and [[communalism_versus_secularism_in_indian_history | secular]] tendencies depending on the political situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This comparison highlights a historical pattern of rulers adapting their religious stance for political gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Emperor Akbar's Reign
Emperor Akbar is noted for his policy of Sulh-i-Kul, meaning "Peace For All," promoting equal treatment of all religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. His administration included the "Navratna" (Nine Gems), wise councillors who helped implement pro-people schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Four of these nine were Hindus: Raja Todar Mal, Raja Man Singh, Raja Birbal, and Tansen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

Under Akbar's rule:
*   The Vishwanath temple was built under the supervision of Raja Man Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   Saint Tulsidas wrote Ramcharitmanas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   Ram Leela performances began through Tulsidas's disciple, Megha Bhagat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   Many Hindu epics, including Ramayana, Mahabharata, Vishnu Purana, and Katha Saritsagar, were translated into Persian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

## Prince Dara Shikoh and Religious Harmony
Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh, a proponent of interfaith understanding, translated 52 Upanishads and the Bhagawat Geeta into Persian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. He believed the Upanishads were the "Kitab al-Maknun" (hidden, lost books) mentioned in the Qur'an as humanity's first monotheistic text, emphasizing their importance for Muslims and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. His Persian translations facilitated their later translation into French and Latin, influencing figures like American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson and contributing to the global study of Indian religious and cultural texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Delhi's Dalhousie Road was renamed Dara Shikoh Road in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, and in 2020, [[modi_governments_impact_on_indias_cultural_and_historical_perception | Modi]]'s Ministry of Culture set up a panel to locate his grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

## Bahadur Shah Zafar: The Last Mughal
Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal ruler, celebrated Hindu festivals like Dussehra and Diwali alongside Eid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. He and his son opposed [[role_of_european_powers_in_india_during_the_17th_and_18th_centuries | British colonialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. During the 1857 Revolt, soldiers from Meerut proclaimed him their leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. He urged Nawabs, zamindars, and local leaders, including Nana Saheb, Rani Lakshmi Bai, and Begum Hazrat Mahal, to unite against [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | British rule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. He was eventually captured by the British and exiled to Burma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>, where his grave was visited by Prime Minister Modi in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

## Conclusion
The history of the Mughal Empire, as presented in the transcript, shows a complex interplay of policies and cultural interactions that often contradict the simplified "Hindu vs. Muslim" narratives propagated in modern discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. While periods of religious discrimination did occur, there is extensive evidence of collaboration, mutual respect, and shared cultural development between Hindus and Muslims throughout the Mughal era, reflecting a "Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb" (composite culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

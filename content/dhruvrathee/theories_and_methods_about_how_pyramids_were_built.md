The construction of the ancient Egyptian pyramids, particularly the [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | Great Pyramid of Giza]], built approximately 4,500 years ago, remains a subject of intense fascination and debate. Standing at an original height of 147 meters, it held the record as the world's tallest structure for over 4,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Composed of heavy stones, the [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | Great Pyramid]] is estimated to weigh 6 million tonnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, dwarfing modern structures like the [[innovations_and_technologies_in_skyscraper_design | Burj Khalifa]], which weighs 500,000 tonnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The absence of modern technology like cranes, bulldozers, or even wheels at the time of its construction makes its creation a significant historical mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Purpose of the Pyramids

The pyramids were primarily constructed as tombs for the Pharaohs, reflecting the [[ancient_egyptian_beliefs_about_the_afterlife_and_tombs | ancient Egyptian belief in the afterlife]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. They believed that after death, the soul journeyed to the underworld and was judged by the Gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. To prepare for this journey, Pharaohs commissioned grand tombs during their reign, filled with food, treasures, jewelry, furniture, and clothes for use in the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. After death, their bodies were mummified and sealed in sarcophagi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

This purpose is largely confirmed by [[archaeological_evidence_and_historical_interpretations_of_pyramids | scripts found on other pyramids]] and sarcophagi that detail ancient Egyptian customs, and by the fact that a majority of historical pyramids in Egypt and Sudan have been used as tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. While the [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | Great Pyramid of Giza]] itself yielded only three relics and an empty sarcophagus, believed to have been looted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, the consensus among historians is that it served as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Dispelling Alternative Theories

Despite the historical consensus, the lack of substantial evidence *within* the [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | Great Pyramid]] has given rise to [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | alternative and conspiracy theories about the pyramids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. These include:
*   **Power Plant Theory**: This theory suggests the [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | Great Pyramid]] was a power plant, claiming ancient Egyptians were technologically advanced enough to generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Artwork from ancient Egyptian temples is sometimes presented as evidence of them building light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. However, this artwork actually depicts Egyptian mythological stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Granary Theory**: Proposed by politician Ben Carson in 1998, this theory claims the pyramids were built by "Jesus Christ's father" (Joseph) to store grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This is largely dismissed as a theory driven by religious appeasement rather than historical fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Alien Construction**: Some claim that the pyramids were built by aliens, arguing that human capabilities at the time could not have achieved such a feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. This view is considered a shortcut, going against scientific principles by seeking bizarre explanations when concrete evidence is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## Construction Workforce and Materials

The idea that slaves built the pyramids, popularized by the Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th century BC, is now known to be false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Instead, the pyramids were built by highly skilled laborers, estimated to be between 20,000 and 30,000 workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. These workers were well-fed—better than the average Egyptian citizen—and lived in cities near the construction site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Various communities, including farmers during their off-season, contributed to the project, demonstrating national unity and loyalty to the Pharaoh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The construction involved:
*   **Limestone**: Approximately 5.5 million tonnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Granite**: 8,000 tonnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Mortar**: 500,000 tonnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Most materials were sourced locally, while some were transported up to 800 km from Southern Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Quarrying and Cutting Stones

Ancient Egyptians primarily used copper tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. For harder rocks like granite, they used dolerite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. A unique method involved finding cracks in rocks, inserting wooden wedges soaked in water, which expanded when saturated, causing the rock to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Theories of Stone Transportation and Stacking

The greatest mysteries revolve around moving and stacking stones weighing between 2.5 to 80 tonnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The [[the_great_pyramid_of_giza_and_its_construction | Great Pyramid of Giza]] is believed to have been completed in just 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Transportation Methods

*   **Rafts**: Stones were likely transported from quarries using rafts floating on the Nile River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Sledges on Wet Ground**: Once on land, stones were moved using sledges over wet ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. A 2014 study based on a painting from the tomb of Djehutihotep (c. 1900 BC) showed 170 people pulling a statue on a sledge, with a man pouring water on the sand in front of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Physicist Daniel Bonn and his team discovered that adding a specific ratio of water (2% to 5%) to sand significantly reduces friction, making it easier to pull heavy objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Stacking Methods

Since wheels were not used for transport during the 4th Dynasty (only for pottery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, two main theories propose how stones were lifted:

1.  **Ramp Systems**:
    *   **Straight Slope Ramp**: Scholars suggest that a straight ramp was built from the ground to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. To move stones up, a system of wooden pillars was installed on the sides of the ramps, with ropes used around the pillars to pull the stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This concept was suggested by physicist Joseph West in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. To maintain a manageable angle, the ramp would have needed to be very long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
    *   **Uncovered Ramp**: In 2015, a 4,500-year-old wooden ramp was uncovered in a quarry by English and French archaeologists, lending credence to ramp theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

2.  **Lever Systems**: An alternative theory suggests the use of levers to stack stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This method would involve a high fulcrum, a long pole, and counterweights to lift, turn, and place stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Scholars note that a similar mechanism, known as a "Shadoof," was used in Egypt for millennia to draw water from the Nile for irrigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Challenges and Mortar Use

A significant challenge for all theories is the estimated 20-year construction timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. To meet this deadline, with 20,000 workers, a stone would need to be placed every three minutes, every day of the year, which seems highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This discrepancy means the exact methods remain a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

The bottom layers of the pyramid were placed without mortar, while upper layers utilized mortar for stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The unique chemistry of the mortar used is known to scientists, but they have been unable to recreate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

The outermost layer of the pyramids was made of fine, whitish limestone, which would have made them shine brilliantly in sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. While most of this casing has eroded from the Pyramids of Khufu and Menkaure, a section remains visible on the Pyramid of Khafre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

## Design Precision and Alignment Theories

The pyramids are designed with remarkable precision, with their directions pointing almost perfectly towards North, East, South, and West, with an error of only one-fifteenth of a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This precision is astonishing given the absence of compasses or GPS technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Proposed explanations for this precision include:
1.  **Autumn Equinox**: This theory suggests that the Egyptians aligned the pyramids by observing the Autumn Equinox, when the tilt of the Earth causes day and night to be of equal length and shadows align perfectly East-West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. The minute error in the pyramid's alignment matches the error in shadows during the equinox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
2.  **Constellation Alignment**: This theory proposes that stars and constellations were used for alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
    *   **Orion Correlation Theory**: In 1989, author Robert Bauval proposed that the three Giza pyramids align with the three stars of Orion's Belt, suggesting intentional astronomical alignment by ancient Egyptians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. However, historians consider this a [[alternative_and_conspiracy_theories_about_the_pyramids | fringe theory]] because the pyramids were not planned or built simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Astronomical tests in 1999 also showed that the pyramids do not align exactly with the stars of Orion's Belt, partly due to the constellation's movement over thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

The mystery of the pyramids serves as a classic example of how humans seek patterns and explanations, sometimes leading to bizarre theories when concrete evidence is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. While many aspects of pyramid construction remain unsolved, ongoing archaeological research continues to shed light on these ancient wonders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

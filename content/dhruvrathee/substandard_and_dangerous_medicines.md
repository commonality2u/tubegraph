The [[political_donations_by_pharma_companies | Electoral Bond Scam]] in India is described as a "collection of a multitude of scams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, including instances where companies extorted or were given government tenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Among these, some cases involve playing with the lives of citizens through substandard medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

If a person dies due to bad-quality medicines, it cannot be considered "God's will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The issue is compounded when [[government_regulatory_failures | government regulators]] ignore poor quality drugs, leading to fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Remdesivir Quality Concerns

A Live Mint report from December 2021 by health reporter Priyanka Pulla highlighted incidents from May 2021 during India's second wave of Covid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Zydus Cadila's Remdesivir

At Uttar Pradesh's Chiranjeev Hospital, anesthesiologist Jitendra Pal received calls about patients developing strange symptoms, including shivering, high fever, and plummeting blood oxygen levels, an hour after receiving the first shot of the anti-viral medication Remdesivir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Similar reactions were observed in four patients at Lifeline Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Investigations revealed that both hospitals used the same batch of shots, V100167, manufactured by Gujarat-based company Zydus Cadila <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This medicine was procured by the UP government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Doctors stopped using the batch, and patients' conditions improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Similar stories emerged from other hospitals in Uttar Pradesh, including Jhansi Maharani Lakshmi Bai Medical College, Meerut's Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, and Varanasi's Ashirvad and Apex Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Between May 7th and 9th, Dr. Anuj Kumar reported five patients who purchased Remdesivir (batch V100156) suddenly developed fever and breathing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. News of patients getting sicker after taking Remdesivir from similar batches (V100153, 156, 166, 167, 170, or L100148) also came from Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Bihar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. In all these cases, Cadila was the manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Regulatory Inaction and Findings

While many hospitals raised concerns, state regulators in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Gujarat took little action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Only Bihar's regulators tested batch V100167 and found it contained bacterial endotoxins, compounds that can cause fever and septic shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. A case was filed against Cadila in Patna's civil court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Despite Bihar's regulator informing Gujarat FDCA about the substandard quality, the Gujarat FDCA, responsible for checking the quality of medicines from the manufacturing unit in Gujarat, did not conduct any testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The Joint Commissioner of Gujarat's Regulatory Lab stated the batches never reached their lab for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. There is no proof the Gujarat FDCA recalled the medicines, as required by the Drugs and Cosmetics law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Cadila's spokesperson denied the allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### WHO's Warning and Political Connections

Six months prior, in November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had advised against using Remdesivir, based on a study of over 14,000 people across 450 hospitals in 35 countries, which found it ineffective against Covid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Despite this, the Indian government approved Remdesivir and discussed increasing its production, as seen in an April 2021 press release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Seven Indian companies, including Zydus Cadila, received licenses to manufacture the medicine, originally developed by an American company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The chronology linking these events to the Electoral Bond Scam is as follows:
1.  WHO advised against Remdesivir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
2.  The Modi government ignored WHO and approved increased production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
3.  Zydus Cadila received manufacturing approval from Gujarat FDCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
4.  Hospitals in five states reported patient decline due to defective batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
5.  Bihar's regulator found bacterial endotoxins in defective batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
6.  Gujarat FDCA did not test the defective batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Electoral bond data revealed Zydus Cadila donated ₹180 million to BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The company also donated ₹30 million to Congress, then in power in Rajasthan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, and ₹80 million to BJP's ally, Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM), which is in power in Sikkim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. SKM received donations from five companies, four of which were pharma companies, leveraging Sikkim's status as a pharma hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Other Pharma Companies with Quality Issues and Political Donations

### Glenmark Pharmaceuticals

Glenmark Pharmaceuticals received five notices between 2022 and 2023 for [[pharmaceutical_quality_control_issues | substandard medicines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, four of which were from Maharashtra Food and Drugs Administration regarding a blood pressure regulating medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The company bought electoral bonds worth ₹97.5 million in November 2022, all encashed by BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Torrent Pharma

Gujarat-based Torrent Pharma's antiplatelet medicine, Deplatt 150, failed the salicylic acid test and was declared substandard by Maharashtra FDA in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. In October 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned the company due to repeated quality-related failures in its manufacturing units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Despite the US warning, the BJP government in Gujarat took no action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Between May 2019 and January 2024, Torrent Pharma bought electoral bonds worth ₹775 million, with the majority (₹610 million) going to BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Cipla

Major pharma company Cipla received four show-cause notices concerning its medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. In August 2018, its RC cough syrup failed to meet standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. In July 2021, it received two notices for Remdesivir medicines found to have insufficient active ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Cipla bought electoral bonds worth ₹392 million, with ₹370 million going to BJP and ₹22 million to Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The company bought bonds in July and October 2019, and again in November 2022, after the BJP coalition government was reformed in Maharashtra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Fatalities from Contaminated Cough Syrups

The issue of substandard drugs directly impacts public health.

### Marion Biotech

In December 2022, 18 children in Uzbekistan died from drinking substandard cough syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. In January 2023, WHO linked these deaths to two contaminated cough syrups, Ambronol Syrup and Dok1-Max Syrup, which contained high amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Both were manufactured by Uttar Pradesh-based Marion Biotech and distributed by Quramax Medical in Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

Similar incidents occurred in Gambia and Cameroon, where children died from contaminated cough syrups, involving other Indian companies: Haryana-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals and Madhya Pradesh-based Riemann Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. In total, 141 children died, with Marion Biotech's syrup linked to 68 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Uzbekistan's response included banning all drugs imported by Quramax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, cancelling its license in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, destroying remaining medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, and sentencing 23 responsible individuals to 2 to 20 years imprisonment, including Raghvendra Pratar Singh, the Indian Executive Director of Quramax, who received 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

In India, an investigation by the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation found 22 samples of Marion Biotech's cough syrup to be adulterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Reuters reported that Marion Biotech purchased industrial-grade propylene glycol, which is toxic for humans and used in detergents or paints, from Maya Chemtech India, a company without a license to sell pharmaceutical-grade materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The then head of operations, Tuhin Bhattacharya, confessed the company had exported cough syrups for over 10 years without testing their Propylene Glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

The Pharmaceutical Export Promotion Council of India suspended Marion Biotech's registration certificate in December 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Uttar Pradesh authorities cancelled its manufacturing license in March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, and three employees were arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. An FIR was lodged against directors Sachin Jain and Jaya Jain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. However, the three arrested employees were later released on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. In April 2023, the Allahabad High Court ordered that Sachin Jain and Jaya Jain could not be arrested unless convicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Shockingly, in October 2023, the company was allowed to reopen its factory, with an order stating it could manufacture and sell all products *except* those containing propylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

### Digital Vision Pharma

In September 2023, it was reported that around 12 children, some as young as two months old, died in Udhampur district of J&K due to a cough syrup with high diethylene glycol content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The cough syrup, made by Digital Vision Pharma Company, was found to use industrial-grade ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Despite the deaths, it took three years to file a charge sheet, and after four years, no one has been found guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Prior to this incident, the company had received at least 16 warnings from drug regulators in Maharashtra and Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

### Broader Impact

In December 2023, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation tested cough syrup samples and found that 54 pharma companies failed export quality tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. This has significant implications for India's reputation as the "Pharmacy of the World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Government's Stance on Drug Quality

Instead of making [[pharmaceutical_quality_control_issues | quality control]] stricter, the government passed laws to *ease* penalties for low-quality drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. The Jan Vishwas Bill decriminalizes minor offenses committed by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Public health activist Dinesh Thakur criticized this, stating such offenses should not be decriminalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. The government amended Section 27D of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, which previously stipulated 1-2 years imprisonment for failing lab tests; now, an out-of-court compromise is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### Hetero Group

Maharashtra's FDA issued six notices to Hetero for substandard drugs, three of which concerned their Remdesivir medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The former Joint Commissioner of Drugs stated that such numerous violations should have led to the cancellation of the company's manufacturing license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Instead, the company quietly recalled the medicines and bought electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. The Hetero group donated ₹1.2 billion to BRS (then in power in Telangana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, and its founder and chairman were even given Rajya Sabha seats by BRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. When BJP returned to power in Maharashtra in 2022, they encashed bonds worth ₹150 million from Hetero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

Overall, pharma companies donated ₹9.45 billion to political parties through electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Prime Minister Modi commented on electoral bonds, stating that systems are not always perfect and shortcomings can be improved upon, claiming the bonds allowed for transparency in funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. However, the electoral bond system was a secret political funding method, and transparency only came when the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional and struck it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This information was made public due to the investigative work of Project Electoral Bond, a collaborative effort of Newslaundry, Scroll, The News Minute, and other independent journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

A significant point of discussion in the recent [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | conflict between Israel and Palestine]] is the apparent [[intelligence_failure_and_government_accountability | failure of Mossad]], Israel's intelligence agency, to intercept the attack [00:05:46].

## The Surprise Attack and Intelligence Failure

On October 7th, at 6:30 AM, thousands of rockets were fired at Israeli cities, with the group Hamas claiming 5,000 rockets were launched within 20 minutes [00:00:04]. This surprise attack led to thousands of people being killed and injured in Israel [00:00:51]. This incident is considered the largest surprise attack in the [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | Israel-Palestine conflict]] in decades, drawing comparisons to the Yom Kippur War of October 1973 [00:00:57]. The attack also involved a multi-pronged assault by Hamas from ground, sea, and air, including breaking down the Israel-Gaza border wall, infiltration by militants on motorcycles and motor-powered hang-gliders, and attacks by speedboats [00:01:21].

## Capabilities of Mossad and Past Successes

Mossad is widely regarded as one of the most powerful intelligence agencies globally [00:05:57]. It is believed to have informants within Palestinian military groups, as well as in Lebanon, Syria, and other parts of the world [00:06:01]. In the past, Mossad agents have executed precise, timed assassinations of major military leaders, sometimes utilizing GPS trackers on vehicles or drone strikes [00:06:08].

## Specific Failures and Criticisms

Despite Mossad's formidable reputation, questions have been raised about how they failed to detect the stockpiling of thousands of rockets in Gaza [00:06:24]. The Gaza-Israel border features a sophisticated fencing system equipped with cameras, ground motion sensors, and is regularly patrolled by the army; however, these "smart barriers" reportedly failed [00:06:34].

Domestically, the Israeli government faces significant criticism [00:06:44]. The former head of the Israeli Navy described the situation as a "huge failure on the part of the government" [00:06:48]. He noted that the entire country is questioning the whereabouts of the IDF, police, and security forces [00:06:56]. Additionally, Egyptian intelligence officials had reportedly issued repeated warnings to Israel about an impending major event, which were allegedly disregarded [00:07:10].

## Ongoing Investigations

A major investigation has already commenced regarding this [[intelligence_failure_and_government_accountability | intelligence failure]] [00:07:01].

The figures of Aurangzeb and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj are often invoked in contemporary political discourse, particularly during elections. Prime Minister Modi, for instance, has referenced Aurangzeb's alleged atrocities and destruction of Hindu temples during campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Such mentions are characterized as intentional talking points, aiming to evoke specific sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The "Brainwashing Mafia" and Historical Revisionism

Certain narratives, amplified through platforms like WhatsApp, aim to brainwash individuals into believing that Hindu ancestors were enslaved and oppressed by Muslims for thousands of years, painting Hindus as victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This agenda fuels extreme hatred towards historians like Romila Thapar and Irfan Habib, who are criticized for asserting that Hindus were not perpetually enslaved, but were free people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

This narrative, which posits a continuous oppression of Hindus by Muslims, clashes with historical facts, leading to a phenomenon akin to George Orwell's "Double Think," where contradictory ideas are simultaneously accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. For example, it's difficult to reconcile the idea of universal Hindu enslavement with the existence of powerful emperors like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, under whose reign Hindus were free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj: A Secular Hindu Ruler

Contrary to simplistic portrayals of a Hindu-Muslim conflict, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's rule was characterized by religious tolerance and inclusion:
*   **Family Background**: Shivaji's uncle, Sharifji, was named after a Sufi saint, indicating a tradition of respecting both Hindu and Muslim saints in his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Respect for Muslims**: Shivaji Maharaj frequently visited Sufi saints like Yakut Baba in Kelshi for blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Policy of Religious Freedom**: A letter from November 2, 1669, quoted by Pandit Raghunath Rao, states Shivaji's order that "everybody is free to follow his religion, and nobody is allowed to disturb it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. His reign ensured proper arrangements for people to offer prayers as they chose, including piers and mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Protection of Islamic Sanctuaries and Women**: Historian Khafi Khan noted Shivaji's strict rule forbidding soldiers from harming women, the Qur'an, or mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. On one occasion, when his army captured the daughter-in-law of a Muslim governor, Shivaji sought her forgiveness and sent her back respectfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This act was notably criticized by Savarkar, a figure seen as a role model by some, who advocated for using violence against women as a weapon of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
*   **Muslims in Shivaji's Army**:
    *   In 1648, 500-700 Pathans from the Vijapur Army joined Shivaji due to his reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
    *   His infantry chief was Noor Khan Beg, a Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
    *   His lieutenant was Shama Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
    *   His top navy chiefs were Daulat Khan and Darya Sarang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
    *   Siddi Hilal and Ibrahim Khan commanded his artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
    *   His secretary of intelligence was Maulana Haider Ali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   **Interactions with Muslim Rulers**: While Shivaji is famously depicted defeating Afzal Khan (Adil Shahi Sultanate), Afzal Khan's advisor was a Hindu Brahmin, Krishnamurti Bhaskar Kulkarni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Conversely, Shivaji carried an iron claw on the advice of his Muslim bodyguard, Rustam-e-zaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

## Aurangzeb: A Complex Ruler

Aurangzeb is often portrayed as a Muslim fanatic who oppressed Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. While there is evidence of his communal policies, his reign also reveals a complex reality:

### Communal Policies and Actions
*   **Temple Demolitions**: During his rule, many Hindu temples were demolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Historian S.A.A. Rizvi noted the phasing out of Akbar's policy of coexistence during Aurangzeb's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. Orders for demolishing Hindu temples to establish Islam were mentioned in Saqi Mustaid Khan's *Maasir-i-Alamgiri* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. Historians like Irfan Habib and Audrey Truschke confirm that Aurangzeb demolished temples in Mathura and Varanasi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   **Discriminatory Taxation**: In 1665, Aurangzeb increased customs duty on Hindu traders to double that paid by Muslim traders, and two years later, customs duty for Muslims was entirely abolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. He also imposed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.

### Instances of Inclusion and Tolerance
*   **Hindu Presence in Administration and Army**:
    *   In the Battle of Purandar, where Shivaji lost 23 forts, Aurangzeb's army was led by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, a Hindu Rajput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
    *   After the Battle of Saleri, Aurangzeb's lieutenants sent a Hindu Brahmin as an ambassador to Shivaji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
    *   His chief diwan was Raja Raghunath Ray, a Hindu, whom Aurangzeb considered the greatest administrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
    *   Hindu participation in elite levels of the [[Mughal Empires history and administration|Mughal administration]] increased by 50% under Aurangzeb, with Hindus constituting 31.6% of the Mughal nobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
    *   In 1679, there were around 72 Rajput mansabdars and 96 Maratha mansabdars under Aurangzeb, with Marathas making up one-fifth of the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.
*   **Orders for Religious Harmony**:
    *   In 1654, Aurangzeb sent a princely order to Rana Raj Singh of Mewar, stating that great kings should ensure peace and prosperity for subjects of every religion, and he criticized rulers who destroy places of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
    *   In February 1659, he ordered officials in Banaras not to disturb any Brahmin or Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
    *   In 1687, he ordered the construction of homes for pious Brahmins and holy fakirs at a Banaras ghat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.
*   **Support for Hindu Institutions**:
    *   He participated in religious discussions with Bairagi Hindu Shiv Mangaldas Maharaj in the 1680s and showered the saint with gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.
    *   In 1691, he gave tax-free land and eight villages to Mahant Balak Das Nirvani to support a Balaji temple in Chitrakoot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.
    *   He also gave lands or encouraged temple construction at various places, including Allahabad, Vrindavan, and Bihar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.
    *   His policy was extended to Jains, granting land in Shatrunjaya, Girnar, and Mount Abu in the late 1650s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

## Comparing Rulers: Context and Complexity

The historical records show a nuanced picture, where rulers like Aurangzeb exhibited both communal and secular actions, depending on the situation and political gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Eminent historian Harbans Mukhia draws a parallel between Aurangzeb and modern politicians like Narendra Modi, noting similarities such as their birthplace in Gujarat, self-projection as holy figures (fakir), and a power-hungry nature leading to shifting communal and secular stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.

> [!info] The [[Communalism versus secularism in Indian history|Communalism versus secularism in Indian history]] is not a simple dichotomy, even for historical figures.

Shivaji Maharaj, in contrast, consistently demonstrated secularism. He criticized Aurangzeb's imposition of the Jizya tax, stating that the God of the Qur'an is the God of the universe, not for Muslims alone, and that spreading hatred against any religion goes against God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. He praised Akbar for ruling for 52 years, treating everyone equally, and being honored as a Jagatguru (world teacher) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>.

## Beyond Hindu-Muslim Rivalry

History reveals that the relationship between Hindus and Muslims in India was far more complex than a constant rivalry. For example, in the Battle of Haldighati, Maharana Pratap had an Afghan Muslim general, Hakim Khan Sur, while Akbar's army included Hindu general Raja Man Singh and many Rajput soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. The Vishwanath temple, demolished by one Mughal emperor, was built under the supervision of Raja Man Singh during Akbar's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

Akbar himself championed the doctrine of Sulh-i-Kul (Peace For All) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a> and his "Nine Gems" included four Hindus: Raja Todar Mal, Raja Man Singh, Raja Birbal, and Tansen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>. Hindu epics were translated into Persian during his reign, and Ram Leela began during his rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.

Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh translated 52 Upanishads and the Bhagawat Geeta into Persian, believing the Upanishads to be the "Kitab al-Maknun" (hidden books) mentioned in the Qur'an <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. His work facilitated the global study of Indian religious texts, influencing figures like Ralph Waldo Emerson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>. Dara Shikoh's historical significance is recognized, with a road in Delhi renamed after him and a government panel set up to locate his grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>.

The last Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, celebrated Hindu festivals alongside Eid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. He opposed [[British expansion and control in India leading to the British Raj|British colonialism]] during the 1857 Revolt, uniting with Hindu leaders like Nana Saheb and Rani Lakshmi Bai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.

> [!info] Other Secular Muslim Rulers
> *   **Wajid Ali Shah**: The last king of Awadh, who introduced Adaab as a secular salutation in Lucknow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>.
> *   **Zainul Abidin**: Kashmir's ruler who abolished the Jizya tax, prohibited cow slaughter, and patronized Sanskrit literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>.

Such historical evidence demonstrates that common Hindu and Muslim masses coexisted happily, fostering the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb, respecting saints, celebrating festivals together, and contributing to shared art forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>. The idea of Hindus being perpetually oppressed by Muslims is a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>. Despite instances of [[Communalism versus secularism in Indian history|communal violence]], Hindus and Muslims have shared a common history over the last 1,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Contemporary Misinformation
> The narrative of Hindus being downtrodden for thousands of years and gaining "real confidence" only recently is propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>. This disrespects historical figures like Krishnadevaraya, Maharana Pratap, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and saints like Tulsidas and Swami Vivekananda, who epitomized strength and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>. Swami Vivekananda, in his 1893 Chicago speech, expressed pride in belonging to a religion that taught tolerance and universal acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>.

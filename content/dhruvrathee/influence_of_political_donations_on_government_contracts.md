The [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | Electoral Bond]] Scheme, introduced by the Modi government in 2017, has been described as a "collection of [[scams_and_corruption_in_political_donations | scams]]" and the "biggest extortion racket in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The core principle of this scheme, as revealed through subsequent investigations, was "You give me kickbacks, I will give you business opportunities, and if you don't give me kickbacks, I will trap you with ED's mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## The Secrecy of Electoral Bonds
When introduced, the [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | Electoral Bonds]] Scheme was designed to hide the identities of donors and recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Citizens were not permitted to know which companies paid what amounts to which political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, leading many to predict a major financial scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Despite government claims that buyer identities would be hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, investigations by journalist Poonam Agarwal revealed that every bond contained a secret Unique Alphanumeric Number, visible under ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This allowed the government to track donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Further revelations from an RTI filed by retired Navy Officer Lokesh Batra and records reviewed by HuffPost India showed that the State Bank of India (SBI) recorded these serial numbers to create an audit trail, and Section 6(4) of a January 2018 notification stated that SBI must provide electoral bond details to any law enforcement agency upon request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This meant agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) or Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which have become "government's puppets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, could easily determine who donated to which party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This lack of [[transparency_and_accountability_in_political_funding | transparency]] for the public and opposition, combined with the ruling party's access to donor information, turned the scheme into a "secret weapon against the opposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Supreme Court Intervention and Data Release
On February 15, 2024, the Supreme Court declared the [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | Electoral Bonds]] scheme unconstitutional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This decision was based on petitions filed by CPI(M) and NGOs Common Cause and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), represented by Advocate Prashant Bhushan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The Court emphasized that citizens have a right to know about political donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Crucially, the Court expressed concern that the scheme was used to facilitate [[scams_and_corruption_in_political_donations | kickbacks]] and that contributions could be seen as "purely business transactions" where "companies are donating to get some benefits in return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Consequently, SBI was directed to release the data, which revealed two lists: companies and individuals who bought bonds, and political parties that encashed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Initially, SBI withheld the secret numbers, preventing the exact matching of donors to recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, but the Supreme Court again rebuked SBI and ordered full data release by March 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Some political parties, including Samajwadi Party, Aam Aadmi Party, and DMK, proactively released their donor lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Notably, CPI, CPI-M, All-India Forward Bloc, and CPI-ML refused to accept [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] on principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## The Fraudulent Mechanism: Public Funds for Political Gain
The scam involved a three-way transfer: the government took money from public funds, put it into companies' hands, and in return, companies transferred money from their coffers to the ruling party through [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This effectively meant robbing the common masses to benefit the rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Two main types of fraud emerged:

### 1. Tax Evasion and Extortion
Companies that evade taxes or engage in illegal activities were often given a "free pass" by the government in exchange for [[corporate_funding_and_political_donations | political donations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Agencies like ED would remain silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Analysis of the top 30 donors found that 14 companies had been raided by central agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This suggests either [[influence_of_wealth_and_connections_on_the_justice_system | extortion]] by the government, demanding payments regardless of innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, or a quid pro quo where illegal activities were overlooked in exchange for [[corporate_funding_and_political_donations | donations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

### 2. Compromised Public Projects and Undue Benefits
Government contracts for public projects, which should be awarded based on merit, quality, and fair pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, were instead influenced by [[corporate_funding_and_political_donations | political donations]]. This led to public funds being wrongfully utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a> and potentially dangerous outcomes.

#### Case Studies:

*   **Navayuga Engineering Company Limited**: This company was awarded the contract to build the Uttarakhand tunnel, which collapsed, trapping 41 workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Between 2019 and 2022, Navayuga bought [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] worth ₹550 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

*   **Ranjit Buildcon**: Responsible for an under-construction flyover in Ahmedabad that collapsed in December 2021, marking the third such incident for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Inquiry revealed compromised quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Despite this, the company received multiple projects from Gujarat's civic bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Between January and July 2023, Ranjit Buildcon bought [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] worth ₹90 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

*   **BG Shirke Construction Private Limited**: This Pune-based company purchased [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] for ₹1.18 billion between January 2023 and January 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Prior to this, an FIR was registered against them in June 2022 for negligence leading to four deaths in an elevator crash at a housing project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Another incident in October 2018 saw four deaths from a tower crane fall at their construction site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

*   **Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Limited (MEIL)**: Between 2019 and 2023, MEIL bought [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] worth ₹9.66 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Associated companies (Western UP Power Transmission Company Limited, SEPC Power, Evey Trans Private Limited) added over ₹12 billion in total bond purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
    *   **Kaleshwaram Multipurpose Irrigation Project**: In Telangana, this project's estimated cost ballooned from ₹810 billion to over ₹14.7 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. A CAG report revealed MEIL was paid ₹51.80 billion in excess for four packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Other contractors like L&T and Navayuga Engineering also received at least ₹75 billion in "extended undue benefits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Projects worth ₹250 billion were awarded before detailed project reports were received, and environmental clearances were deemed illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
    *   **Zojila Tunnel**: In August 2020, MEIL, a "small company from Hyderabad," secured this ₹45 billion contract to connect Srinagar and Leh, despite multiple bids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
    *   **Thane-Borivali Twin Tunnel**: In April 2023, MEIL purchased [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] worth ₹1.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. The following month, it was awarded this ₹144 billion project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
    *   **Defence Ministry Project**: In June 2023, MEIL was given a ₹5 billion project by the Defence Ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

It is noted that MEIL was raided by the Income Tax Department in October 2019, yet subsequently purchased billions in [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] and received numerous projects from both state and central governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

Other notable cases mentioned, which warrant further investigation, include:
*   Future Gaming, a lottery company raided by central agencies, whose owner's son met with the Finance Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   Beef Exporting Companies purchasing [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   Mining giants Vedanta, EMIL, GHCL, MSPL accused of bending environmental rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   Qwik Supply Chain, with directors linked to Reliance, purchasing [[electoral_bonds_and_their_political_impact | electoral bonds]] exceeding its net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

This pattern suggests that political parties, regardless of their political affiliation, prioritize their "share" from these arrangements over public safety or welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

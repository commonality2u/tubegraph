The presence of violence in cinema and its potential societal ramifications are significant concerns. Research indicates that a child deprived of a father's love, whether through absence or excessive strictness, can develop psychological issues that evolve into severe problems in adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Studies show that a father's absence diminishes a child's self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, while harsh parenting is linked to aggressive behaviour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The absence of a caring father can even contribute to someone becoming a criminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Cinematic Portrayals of Parental Impact

While some films sensitively explore these themes, others portray them problematically.

### Acclaimed Films
Cinematic masterpieces have addressed the sensitive topic of father absence and strict upbringing.
*   **'The White Ribbon'**: Honoured with the Best Film Award at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, the International Critics Prize, Best Film at the European Film Awards, over 10 German Film Awards, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **'Ardh Satya'**: Govind Nihalani's film is cited as a remarkable Indian example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **'Udaan'**: Vikramaditya Motwane's film also explores this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Famous songs also highlight the struggle of people to become fathers, despite knowing how to have children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Critiques of Problematic Films
When sensitive concepts are handled by insensitive directors with a track record of regressive and [[representation_of_violence_and_misogyny_in_films | misogynistic films]], the result can be detrimental to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The film 'Animal' is described as a "cringe-fest" that could prove "cancerous" for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Critics are often dismissed for labeling it as such, with arguments that it's "just a film" and comparisons drawn to other violent movies like 'Gangs of Wasseypur', 'Kill Bill', and 'Pulp Fiction' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. It is also argued that watching violence does not drive one to violent behaviour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. However, a director's individual morality and subjective opinions are brought into the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Societal Impact of Media and Environment

A person's behavior, personality, and identity are molded by their surroundings, including parental care, interactions with relatives, school experiences, and, significantly, mass media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. News, books, radio, TV ads, social media, songs, and movies profoundly influence identity formation and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. While some aspects of life are consciously controlled, everything has a subconscious effect on the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Cumulative Effect of Media
Director Sandeep Vanga Reddy argued that watching gangster movies doesn't make someone a gangster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, comparing it to eating unhealthy food without immediately suffering a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, just as continuous unhealthy eating increases health risks, watching a single gangster film doesn't make someone a gangster, but the small, incremental changes inflicted on viewers' psyches accumulate throughout their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

> This saying highlights that a person's behavior, personality, and identity are shaped by their surroundings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>

If a child grows up in a toxic environment, such as one with an abusive father, restrictive rules for girls, YouTubers who objectify women, social media creators like Andrew Tate promoting toxic masculinity and misogyny, songs with objectifying lyrics (e.g., Honey Singh's songs), politicians with regressive views about women, and objectifying TV ads, then films like 'Animal' contribute to this already harmful environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. UNICEF has highlighted a report by the American Psychological Association on how such objectification in mass media contributes to [[representation_of_violence_and_misogyny_in_films | violence against women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Problematic Elements in 'Animal'
In 'Animal', the protagonist, Rannvijay, is shown twisting his wife's arm, grabbing her neck, and pointing a gun at her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The film's director, Sandeep Vanga Reddy, stated in an interview that love is not genuine unless one can hit their partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Despite committing mass murders, Rannvijay's wife never considers leaving him, but encourages him to kill another woman when he has an extramarital affair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. He mocks menstruation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, tells his wife it's a "man's world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, and tells his lover to lick his shoe to prove her love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

While the film attributes Rannvijay's behavior to daddy issues, he exhibits the same neglect towards his own children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The film offers no redemption or positive transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, and Ranbir Kapoor's acting does not convey mental illness, leading to the glorification of [[representation_of_violence_and_misogyny_in_films | misogyny]] and [[personal_philosophies_and_influence_of_media | toxic masculinity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The protagonist performs these actions with utmost confidence, like an "alpha male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## The Appeal of Violence in Cinema

[[representation_of_violence_and_misogyny_in_films | Violence sells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Director Aamir Khan noted that creatively less talented directors heavily depend on violence and sex to make their films work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This is seen in "Slasher films" or "Gore films" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Psychological Basis
There's a psychological reason why some people enjoy watching extreme violence and bloodshed on screen: they often feel powerless and repressed in their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. In the theatre, they can envision themselves as the violent protagonist, finding satisfaction in the violence directed towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Films like 'Animal' take this to an extreme, glamorizing brutal acts like strangling and throat-slitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Such characters, if real, would be psychopaths, but the film dismisses the idea of mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Glamorization vs. Realism
Films can portray violence without glamorizing it, offering a realistic depiction that highlights negative societal impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. However, such realistic films, like Anurag Kashyap's 'Ugly' or 'That Girl in Yellow Boots', often struggle at the box office because audiences find villainous violence disturbing and repulsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The audience's "repressed self" seeks entertainment and craves violence from the hero's standpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, leading directors and producers to capitalize on this demand with action-heavy films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

## Toxic Fandom and Role Models

Films like 'Animal' are criticized for moving away from family-oriented films that deliver positive messages, such as 'Hum Sath Sath Hai', a family drama inspired by the Ramayana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. The protagonist of 'Animal' is contrasted with real-life heroes like Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw (subject of 'Sam Bahadur'), who fought for the country and humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

Characters like Kabir Singh and Rannvijay exemplify a lack of self-control, with behaviours including substance abuse, shouting, beating, and threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. Those who appreciate such regressive characters often label themselves "Macho Man" or "Alpha Male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Toxic Fandom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>
> Films like 'Kabir Singh' and 'Animal' tend to draw in toxic fans. When these films receive criticism, their fans feel their own personality is being criticized, leading to outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

Instead of such figures, men like Lord Ram, known for humility and compassion, should be the ideal models of masculinity for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. A human without compassion is likened to an animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. It is advised to avoid such destructive thinking and films, as our minds deserve respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

The [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | Mahakumbh]] is considered the world's largest human gathering, attracting over 500 million visitors according to government data, many of whom took a dip in the holy Ganga River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The Ganga is highly revered in Hinduism, with numerous pilgrimage sites located along its banks, including Gangotri, Rishikesh, Haridwar, Banaras, and Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad), where the Ganga and Yamuna rivers meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Despite its spiritual significance, concerns have been raised about the river's water quality during the Mahakumbh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Unsafe Water Conditions

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), an agency under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, stated that the river water at the Sangam is not safe enough for bathing, let alone drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)

BOD measures the oxygen required by aerobic microorganisms to break down organic matter in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. High BOD levels indicate significant organic material, such as sewage, waste, food waste, or decaying plant matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. A lower BOD value signifies cleaner water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

*   **Standards**:
    *   Ideally, BOD should be 0 mg per litre for drinkable water, but CPCB considers water drinkable if it's lower than 1 mg per litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   For safe bathing, BOD should be lower than 3 mg per litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

*   **Mahakumbh Readings**:
    *   On January 13, 2025, at the beginning of Mahakumbh, the BOD level at the Sangam was 3.94 mg per litre, exceeding the bathing limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   By January 16, it increased to 5.09 mg per litre at Sangam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   On January 19, it was 5.29 mg per litre, and on January 24, it was 4.08 mg per litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Faecal Coliform Bacteria (FCB)

Faecal Coliform is a type of bacteria found in human and animal faeces and is a key indicator of water quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

*   **Standards**:
    *   A 2004 committee by the Ministry of Urban Development stated a desirable level of 500 MPN per 100 ml and a maximum level of 2,500 MPN per 100 ml for bathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   The World Health Organization (WHO) standards for drinkable water recommend 0 MPN per 100 ml of faecal coliform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

*   **Mahakumbh Readings**:
    *   The CPCB reported to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that Faecal Coliform Bacteria exceeded maximum limits at all monitored Mahakumbh locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   On January 20, at the Sangam, FCB was 49,000 MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   Just before the Sangam, the Yamuna River contained 33,000 MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
    *   On February 4, at the Shastri pool on the Ganga, it was 11,000 MPN, and at the Sangam, it was 7,900 MPN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   Sewage drains flowing into the river are a major source; for example, the Jondhwal drain had 9.2 million MPN per 100 ml, and Rajapur and Salori drains had over 3.4 million MPN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

During the Mahakumbh, the government released freshwater multiple times to dilute the pollution, rather than cleaning the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Regulatory Scrutiny and Government Response

The CPCB directly stated that the river was unsuitable for bathing at all monitored locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT), a body formed to address [[environmental_pollution_and_regulatory_challenges_in_india | environmental disputes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, questioned the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) about water safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The UPPCB initially claimed the water was suitable for bathing but submitted outdated reports from January 12, before the Mahakumbh began, and lacked information on faecal coliform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The NGT criticized UPPCB on February 20 for wasting its time with old data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The UPPCB has also faced accusations of using unscientific methods and providing incorrect reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## [[Impact of polluted water on public health | Health Implications]]

Bathing in such polluted water can cause various [[impact_of_polluted_water_on_public_health | health problems]], including skin diseases, gastrointestinal infections, cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis, especially with high faecal coliform content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. A 2022 CPCB report indicated that about 70% of waterborne diseases in India are caused by river water pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Post-Mahakumbh, medical consultants reported an increase in patients returning from Kumbh with symptoms like diarrhoea, vomiting, and fevers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Government's Claims and the [[Government efforts and failures to clean Ganga | Namami Ganga Project]]

Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Adityanath claimed the water at the Sangam was fit for both drinking and bathing, despite the presence of faecal bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

To counter the growing evidence of pollution, the government issued a press release about a report by "scientist" Dr. Ajay Sonkar, claiming "no bacterial growth" in water samples from 5 ghats, including the Sangam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This report asserted the Ganga's [[selfpurification_properties_of_the_ganga | self-purifying properties]] due to 1,100 types of bacteriophages (natural viruses that kill harmful bacteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. While the Ganga does possess some [[selfpurification_properties_of_the_ganga | self-cleaning properties]], a 2020 research study noted that the current pollution load has overwhelmed these natural abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Dr. Sonkar's "research" lacks published data or journal mentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, and its announcement coincided with NGT's criticism of the UPPCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. In contrast, IIT Delhi researchers published a paper in 2023 finding a large number of disease-causing bacteria in Ganga water samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

The government has launched the [[government_efforts_and_failures_to_clean_ganga | Namami Ganga Project]] in 2014, spending over â‚¹400 billion by 2024 to clean the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Despite these efforts, the CPCB data from January 2023 showed that faecal coliform levels exceeded maximum limits in 70% of monitored Ganga locations due to sewage and industrial waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Deadlines for cleaning the river have been repeatedly postponed, from 2020 to 2022, and now to 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Claims of cleaning rivers like the Sabarmati are often based on beautified sections rather than actual pollution reduction; the Sabarmati was still the second most polluted river in India in 2023, with BOD levels as high as 345 mg per litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

Late professor GD Agarwal, also known as Swami Gyan Swaroop Sanand, dedicated his life to the Ganga, enduring a 111-day hunger strike in 2018 to save the river, but his pleas to Prime Minister Narendra Modi went unanswered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

For those wishing to bathe in the Ganga, the water quality in Rishikesh is generally considered safe for bathing and drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. While the situation between Haridwar and Kanpur is fair, pollution significantly exceeds permissible limits after Kanpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

Superstitions and the practice of black magic are widespread issues that affect people across various religious and social strata. Many individuals claiming miraculous powers or divine connections engage in fraud, leading to financial exploitation, social disruption, and even harm.

## The Rise of "Babás" and Conmen

In recent weeks, a new figure known as Bageshwar Baba, whose real name is Dhirendra Shastri (also Dhirendra Krishna Garg), has gained significant attention. He is a 26-year-old from a village in Madhya Pradesh, where he runs an ashram called Bageshwar Dham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. It is claimed that this Baba can miraculously understand the problems of his followers and provide equally miraculous solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

However, critics, such as satirist Rofl Gandhi, argue that the [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | fraud]] employed by Bageshwar Baba is no different from that used by Christian and Muslim conmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This suggests that the problem of charlatanism transcends religious boundaries, uniting people in their susceptibility to superstitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

### Broader Societal Impact

Beyond miraculous claims, Dhirendra Shastri has been in the news for communal speeches, such as calling for Hindus to unite and have bulldozers run over the homes of ‘stone-pelters’ in April 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. He also encouraged people to take up arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, which was widely seen as a communal speech aimed at disrupting public peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. No arrests were made following these incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He also faced accusations of practicing untouchability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Exposing the Fraud: The Role of Skeptics

Shyam Manav, the National Convenor of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, has been a prominent figure in the fight against superstitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This organization, founded in the 1980s by Narendra Dabholkar, was established specifically to combat superstitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Dabholkar was tragically murdered in August 2013, presumably by fanatics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Following his death, Maharashtra passed a law against human sacrifices, superstitions, and black magic in December 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

Shyam Manav, who identifies as a Sanatani Hindu akin to Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda, states that his opposition is not to any God or religion, but to the [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | fraud]] committed in the name of religion, operating within the framework of the Indian Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. He has reportedly busted over 200 such fraud Babas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Notable cases include:
*   **Shakuntala Devi:** Known as the "Human Computer," she started engaging in [[Critique of astrology as a fraud industry | astrology]] and future predictions, which Shyam Manav challenged, leading to an FIR and her discontinuation of such practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Missionaries:** Shyam Manav successfully lodged a complaint under the 1986 Drugs and Remedies Act against five foreign missionaries who claimed to perform miraculous cures, leading to the arrest of four of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

### The Challenge to Bageshwar Baba

When Dhirendra Shastri was in Nagpur for a Ram Katha, Shyam Manav learned that he was also holding a 'Divya Darbar' where he would perform miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. Manav challenged Dhirendra to two tests:
1.  Identify 10 people in a room by their names, father's names, ages, and phone numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
2.  Predict 10 items kept in the next room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

Shyam Manav offered ₹3 million for 90% accuracy, promising to apologize and disband his organization if Dhirendra won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. Dhirendra, however, left Nagpur two days before his event was scheduled to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Shyam Manav called him a deserter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. This led to death threats against Shyam Manav, with some threatening him with the same fate as Narendra Dabholkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Dhirendra claimed his schedule was only till January 11th and invited Shyam Manav to Raipur or Bageshwar Dham for the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. Shyam Manav insisted the challenge must take place in Nagpur due to law and order considerations and the alleged cordial relations between Baba and Maharashtra's Home Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

## The Global Phenomenon of Pseudoscientific Claims

Such claims of miracles are not isolated incidents. For example, Dhirendra has also claimed to cure cancer with rituals and medicines involving cow urine and turmeric paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

James Randi, a famous magician, established the James Randi Foundation to promote scientific temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. He created a $1 million paranormal challenge, inviting anyone to prove the existence of supernatural or paranormal entities. No one has ever won this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. This challenge highlights the lack of verifiable evidence for supernatural claims, which is further discussed in the video on [[famous_ghost_stories_and_their_debunking | ghosts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

### Examples of Fraudulent Practices Across Religions

The problem of fraudulent spiritual leaders is not confined to one religion:
*   **Hindu Babas:** In 2017, the Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad, the top body of Hindu Sadhus, released a list of 14 fake Babas, including popular names like Aasharam, Radhe Ma, Nirmal Baba, Gurmeet Singh, and Narayan Sai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. Others involved in crimes include Nityanand, Mirchi Baba, and Jalebi Baba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.
*   **Muslim Conmen:** Examples include Akmal Raza, who asked a woman to hand over her daughter to cure her husband's medical condition, and Deen Mohammad, a black magic practitioner caught doing similar things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.
*   **Christian Babas:** A tragic case in Kerala involved a woman being blackmailed by a priest using her secret confession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. Bajinder Singh, a Christian Baba with millions of subscribers, claims to guess names, dispel evil spirits, and cure disabilities, much like Bageshwar Baba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. The film *Trance* (directed by Anwar Rasid) depicts such Christian Babas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

Even educated individuals can fall prey to such conmen, especially those who speak English, as some believe it lends credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>. Examples include claims about food rotting during an eclipse, water making one sick if looked at angrily, or hair and nails growing for 11 days after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. The invitation of such Babas to IITs for lectures highlights a societal lack of scientific temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.

## Why People Fall Victim

Several factors contribute to people believing in these conmen:
*   **Illiteracy:** While a factor, it's not the only reason, as educated individuals are also conned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>.
*   **Indian Education System Faults:** The system often fails to foster critical thinking, forcing rote learning without questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. This results in people who can pass exams but fail to apply basic scientific principles, such as understanding combustion in the context of purifying air through worshipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.
*   **Blind Faith:** This involves believing something without questioning or doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. People often believe because they want to, especially when they are in emotional distress and see no other solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Mental Health Support:** Unlike developed countries where people seek therapists or psychologists for mental problems, India lacks a strong culture of psychological support, leaving individuals with nowhere to turn but to these conmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

Mentalists like Karan Singh Magic and Suhani Shah perform similar "mind-reading" feats for entertainment, explicitly stating that they are tricks, not miraculous cures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.

## The True Spirit of Spiritual Guidance

The concept of a "Baba" or spiritual guide, in its true form, is not inherently negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>. Historically, individuals who studied scriptures and possessed spiritual understanding acted as life coaches or personal counselors, offering selfless service without charging fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. Figures like Adi Shankaracharya, Baba Farid, Kabir, Guru Nanak, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Vivekanand, and Jiddu Krishnamurti exemplify this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

However, the current trend involves fraudsters who lack genuine life advice and instead focus on deceiving people and running businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. The traditional concept of asking for alms has degenerated into begging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to expose these conmen to protect society from their harmful intentions, benefiting both religion and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

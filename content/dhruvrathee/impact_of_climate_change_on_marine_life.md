## Unprecedented Sightings of Deep Sea Creatures

Recently, there has been an increase in sightings of [[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | deep sea creatures]] at the ocean's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. For example, the Sea Devil, also known as the Black Sea Devil Anglerfish, a species that usually resides around 2,000 meters deep, has been spotted at the surface off the Spanish coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This scary-looking fish carries a torch on its head to lure prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Another notable instance involves the oarfish, an extremely long, snake-like fish, typically found about 1 km below the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. According to Japanese legend, the appearance of an oarfish is a sign of disaster, especially earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This belief gained traction when dead oarfish were found on Japanese coasts before the devastating 2011 earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, recent years have seen an unusual increase in oarfish sightings globally, including 50 caught by a fisherman in one go in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Other creatures like the Giant Phantom Jellyfish, with tentacles over 10 meters long and usually found 1-2 km deep, were spotted at only 80 meters depth in Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. A Smooth Lumpfish, resembling a brain, was also caught by fishermen in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. These rare surface appearances raise questions about why [[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | deep sea creatures]] are suddenly coming up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## The Ocean's Depths: A Mystery
The Earth's surface is 71% covered by water, with 97% of this water contained in five main oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. These oceans host 94% of the world's wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. However, humans have explored and mapped only 5% of the oceans, leaving 95%, especially the deep sea, as a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. We have better maps of Mars than our own ocean floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

The ocean is divided into zones based on light penetration:
*   **Sunlight Zone**: The topmost layer where sunlight can reach, supporting diverse and colorful marine life, photosynthesis, and the base of the oceanic food chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Twilight Zone**: Begins at 200 meters, where only blue and violet light penetrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This zone is home to creatures like the Strawberry Squid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, Bloody-Belly Comb Jelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, Sea Angel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, and Barreleye Fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, many of which use bioluminescence for various purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Midnight Zone**: Begins after 1,000 meters, where no sunlight reaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This zone is home to deep sea Anglerfishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> and Vampire Squids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Abyssal Zone**: Extends from 4,000 to 6,000 meters, largely unexplored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. The Titanic wreck is located here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The Dumbo Octopus, possibly the cutest deep sea animal, lives exclusively in this zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Hadal Zone**: The deepest parts of the ocean, from 6,000 to 11,000 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## [[diel_vertical_migration_of_marine_life | Diel Vertical Migration]] and its Disruption
During World War II, sonar operators observed what appeared to be the sea floor rising at night, which was later identified as a massive upward migration of fish, squids, and plankton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the Deep Scattering Layer, is caused by the high density of marine life reflecting sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

This daily upward and downward movement of billions of creatures, from small zooplankton to medium-sized fish, is called [[diel_vertical_migration_of_marine_life | Diel Vertical Migration (DVM)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. It is considered the largest migration on Earth, involving a mass 25 times greater than the total mass of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. The primary reason for this migration is "to eat without being eaten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Small fish and zooplankton feed on phytoplankton at the surface at night to avoid predators like sharks and whales during the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. They then return to the depths before daybreak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

However, in recent years, [[impact_of_el_nio_and_la_nia_on_global_weather_patterns | climate change]] is altering this daily migration, causing creatures to migrate permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## Consequences of Ocean Warming
Global warming causes oceans to absorb over 90% of the Earth's excess heat, leading to rising water temperatures that have been stable for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. As warm water is lighter and remains near the surface, it prevents oxygen from reaching the colder, denser deep waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This results in oxygen shortage in the deep sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

[[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | Deep sea creatures]], evolved in stable oxygen environments, are migrating towards the surface in search of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This is dangerous for them as they are not adapted to surface conditions and become easy prey for predators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Scientists predict that by the end of this century, the Abyssal zone temperature will increase by 1° Celsius, causing deep sea creatures to migrate 4 to 11 times faster than surface-dwelling creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This threatens the future of many amazing creatures, some of which haven't even been discovered yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

Beyond marine life, the deep sea also plays a crucial role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide by storing large quantities of carbon, a function performed by phytoplankton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. However, [[impact_of_el_nio_and_la_nia_on_global_weather_patterns | climate change]] is decreasing the oceans' capacity to absorb carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

## The Threat of [[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | Deep Sea Mining]]
In addition to [[impact_of_el_nio_and_la_nia_on_global_weather_patterns | climate change]], another significant threat to [[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | deep sea creatures]] is [[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | Deep Sea Mining]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Creatures like the Scaly-Foot Snail, which has iron-plated legs and the largest heart relative to its body volume in the animal kingdom, live on the deep sea floor near hydrothermal vents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. These areas are targeted by mining companies for gold and silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
The use of large machines to dig in the deep sea would cause large-scale destruction to this fragile ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. Despite protests, some governments are considering permitting [[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | deep sea mining]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

## Call to Action
[[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | Deep sea mining]] has not been done anywhere in the world yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. The United Nations' International Seabed Authority holds the power to grant permission for this activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. While no country has received permission yet, there is immense pressure on this organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

Many NGOs and activists, along with 32 countries, are openly opposing [[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | deep sea mining]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. Greenpeace has a petition, "Stop [[threat_of_deep_sea_mining | Deep Sea Mining]] Before It Starts," which has garnered over 3 million signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. This represents a "once in a generation" opportunity to prevent the destruction of the deep sea ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition also provides further details on the dangers of this activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

As Mahatma Gandhi said, "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. Protecting the deep sea is crucial for both its unique creatures and the planet's overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

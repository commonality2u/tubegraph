A significant controversy arose in December 2023 involving motivational speakers Sandeep Maheshwari and Vivek Bindra, centering on allegations of a "big scam" related to online courses and multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Initial Allegations by Sandeep Maheshwari

On December 11, Sandeep Maheshwari uploaded a YouTube video titled 'Big Scam Exposed' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. In this video, young individuals shared their experiences of being scammed after purchasing an online course for ₹50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. They claimed the course itself was not remarkable but was being sold like an MLM scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Buyers were allegedly told that to earn significant income, they needed to sell the course to others, effectively turning them into salesmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Many who purchased the course were reportedly poor and unemployed, lured by the promise of earning money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Although Sandeep Maheshwari's video did not explicitly name any individual, viewers widely inferred that the allegations pointed towards Vivek Bindra, another motivational speaker and business coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Vivek Bindra's Response and Counter-Allegations

On December 18, Vivek Bindra released a response video on his YouTube channel, making the incident publicly clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. In his video, he made several counter-allegations against Sandeep Maheshwari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

He claimed that Sandeep Maheshwari also provides business consulting and charges large sums for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Bindra suggested that the [[controversy_surrounding_ranveer_allahbadia_and_samay_raina | controversy]] arose because Sandeep Maheshwari's channel was not getting enough views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

> "You have thousands of videos on business coaching. Since they weren't working out for you, you started making allegations about a scam. Because none of your videos on Business Mastery were getting more than 200,000 views." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

The speaker in the transcript dismisses these as Ad Hominem logical fallacies, which target the person rather than the argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Vivek Bindra also highlighted his achievements, such as making world records, distributing free meals, and building hospitals, implying that a scam could not achieve such feats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. However, the speaker again notes that these points are irrelevant to the scam allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Bindra's Defense and Admission
Vivek Bindra defended himself by stating that his company's records are clean, with financial audits by Ernst & Young ensuring transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He asserted that his sales department has quality, offers a money-back guarantee, and immediately refunds customers in cases of misselling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

He clarified that his activities were "affiliate marketing" and not multi-level marketing (MLM), stating there was only one level involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Despite his defense, Vivek Bindra also admitted that some people had engaged in misselling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. He stated he was ready to apologize for any mistakes and claimed to have shut down the entire program in May due to these misselling issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Sandeep Maheshwari's Direct Attack

On December 20, Sandeep Maheshwari released another video, this time directly and openly targeting Vivek Bindra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. He reiterated the allegations: people were lured at seminars with dreams of luxury cars and earning hundreds of thousands of rupees, only to be told they could achieve this by selling the course to more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Maheshwari launched the hashtag #StopVivekBindra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

> "A product that you did not like, you are asking for your money back, but you are being told that if you want your money back then bring four more fools like you and take 30% or 35% commission on it and whatever money you have invested, you get back the whole amount. This is a scam!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>

## Worsening Situation for Vivek Bindra

During this period, Vivek Bindra faced additional challenges. Old video clips circulated online where he stereotyped SC/ST doctors and criticized [[Controversies and criticism surrounding Narendra Modi | reservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The speaker considers these statements "entirely wrong" and indicative of "privilege blindness," highlighting rampant casteism and discrimination still present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Furthermore, news emerged that Vivek Bindra was booked for allegedly assaulting his wife days after their wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. A police complaint was filed on December 14 by his brother-in-law, Vaibhav Kwatra, alleging that Bindra beat his sister so severely on December 7 that she suffered hearing difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The speaker notes the irony, given Bindra's role as a life coach who quotes from the Bhagavad Gita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. However, the speaker cautions against a media trial, emphasizing that no one should be considered guilty before a court judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Understanding the Legal and Moral Aspects of the Alleged Scam

The core of the controversy lies in determining what is legal, illegal, moral, and immoral in the context of online courses, affiliate marketing, and MLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Defining Business and Online Courses
Business involves selling a product or service for payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Products can be physical or digital, such as online software or courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Online courses can be valuable for learning new skills and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Immoral Branding: The "10-day MBA"
Vivek Bindra offers courses like a "10-day MBA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The speaker views this naming as misleading, suggesting it could make buyers believe they will receive an MBA degree, which typically takes 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. While legally it might be considered a brand name, like "Fresh tomato ketchup," it is deemed "very immoral" due to its potential to deceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Course Pricing and Value
The price of a course, such as ₹50,000 for Bindra's course, does not inherently make it a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The speaker shares personal experience of purchasing courses for up to ₹500,000, finding them valuable because they met specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Similarly, Sandeep Maheshwari's offer of consultation for ₹3.6 million is not deemed wrong if it targets customers who find value in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Advice for buyers is to always check the detailed curriculum on the course page before purchasing to understand its content and potential value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### Misselling: Affiliate Marketing vs. Multi-Level Marketing
The central issue revolves around misselling—selling a course not for its intrinsic value but for the opportunity to earn money by selling it to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

*   **Affiliate Marketing**: This is a legitimate practice where individuals sell someone else's product or service and earn a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Examples include Amazon's affiliate program, where YouTubers link to products they use and earn a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Referral Marketing**: Similar to affiliate marketing, but companies offer rewards (e.g., free storage space from Dropbox) instead of direct commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Direct Selling**: Here, individuals become literal salespeople for a company, selling products door-to-door or in public places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Companies like Eureka Forbes and Tupperware use this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. These methods involve a genuine product or service with intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Network Marketing / Pyramid Schemes**: This involves recruiting more direct sellers. A scam occurs if there's no genuine product, or if the product has no value, and instead, people are primarily selling a "membership" to earn commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
    *   **Legality**: The Price Chits And Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act of 1978 banned the membership system in network marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
    *   **Fraudulent MLM**: Some companies perpetrate scams by selling overpriced products with no intrinsic value (e.g., ₹250 soap kits for ₹7,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Buyers are not buying the product, but the "membership" to a pyramid scheme where top members profit most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
    *   **Regulations**: The Indian government introduced Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules in 2021, mandating that companies cannot force customers to buy by claiming they need to bring in more customers to get their money back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Sales should focus on the product's value and qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### Applying to Bada Business
The crucial question for Vivek Bindra's "Bada Business" is whether the course was sold based on its value as a business learning tool (first sales pitch) or primarily as an opportunity to earn money by selling the course to others as an Independent Business Consultant (IBC) (second sales pitch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the second sales pitch, if primary, is "very immoral" and potentially illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The actual sales pitch used by Vivek Bindra's team remains unclear to the speaker, as they lack direct access to the course content or specific sales pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. The answer can only come from those who bought the course or from Vivek Bindra and his team, by clarifying the number of people who built businesses based on the course content versus those who earned by selling the course further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Conclusion and Advice
The legal resolution of who is right in the Sandeep Maheshwari vs. Vivek Bindra case will be decided in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

For anyone who believes they were scammed, raising their voice and filing a police complaint is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Sandeep Maheshwari is standing in support of such victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

### General Advice to Avoid Scams
To avoid pyramid and MLM scams, individuals should never seek shortcuts to earn money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. The only two consistent steps to earning money are:
1.  **Learn, gain knowledge**: Acquire new skills and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
2.  **Work**: Apply the learned knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

Any promises of quick riches, like BMWs, lottery wins, or betting app success, are dangerous shortcuts that won't lead to long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

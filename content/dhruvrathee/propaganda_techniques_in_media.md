Propaganda is a technique used to manipulate people by spreading information, often biased or misleading, to promote a particular political cause or point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Historically, dictators like Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels articulated key principles of propaganda that are still observed today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Key Propaganda Techniques

### The Big Lie
Adolf Hitler, in his book *Mein Kampf*, described a [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | propaganda technique]] known as the Big Lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This technique involves telling a lie so outrageous that people will believe it, thinking no one could fabricate such a huge falsehood, and thus assume there must be some truth to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. When an outrageous lie is presented with extreme confidence, some people are convinced of its veracity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Repetition
Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, emphasized the importance of repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The Big Lie should be repeated continuously, ideally from multiple sources, to increase people's conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Hearing the same lie from four different sources can make it seem more credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### The Half-Truth
A third technique involves incorporating elements of truth into speeches or narratives, known as the Half-Truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This method is used to convince those who might be skeptical of outright outrageous lies, as some individuals are capable of identifying blatant falsehoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. By mixing truth with lies, the [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | propagandist]] aims to maintain credibility for a portion of the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## "The Kerala Story" as a Case Study in Propaganda

The film "The Kerala Story" is a recent example that utilizes these [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | propaganda techniques]] to mislead the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The film suggests a secret plot in Kerala to convert innocent women to Islam and send them to ISIS, claiming approximately 32,000 girls have been affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Use of Half-Truths in "The Kerala Story"
The director, Sudipto Sen, cited several "true incidents" as inspiration for the film, which upon closer inspection, reveal themselves to be half-truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>:

*   **Oommen Chandy's Statement:** The director referred to a 2010 statement by former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. An India Today report from 2012 confirmed that Chandy stated 2,667 women converted to Islam between 2006 and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, Chandy never used the term "forced conversions" and explicitly stated that forced conversions or hate campaigns against Muslims were not tolerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. There was no mention of these women joining ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **V.S. Achuthanandan's Statement:** The director cited former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan's remark that Kerala would become an Islamic state in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. A video circulating of this statement, uploaded by the film's production company Sunshine Pictures, contained misleading English subtitles that did not match his spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Achuthanandan was actually criticizing PFI for influencing youth to marry Muslim women, not mentioning ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Furthermore, 13 years later, Kerala remains a safe and secular state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Fatima's Story:** The film's teaser featured a girl claiming to be Fatima, imprisoned in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. While there was a Hindu woman named Nimisha Nair who converted to Islam (becoming Nimisha alias Fathima Isa) and went to Afghanistan to join the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), this was one of only three such women from Kerala who converted and joined ISKP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Her husband, Eeza, was a Christian convert to Islam, demonstrating individual cases rather than a widespread conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### The Big Lie of 32,000 Women
The film's central claim that 32,000 women were forcibly converted and sent to ISIS is a clear example of the Big Lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Statistical data contradicts this:

*   Globally, estimates for foreign terrorist fighters who joined ISIS from 110 countries range from 40,000 to 42,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   In India, the number of known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS was around 66 as of November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Out of these, approximately 13 were women, and only 6 women were from Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Among these 6, three converted from other religions (two from Christianity, one from Hinduism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   The director of "The Kerala Story" himself eventually changed the film's description from 32,000 to 3 women after the matter reached court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

The use of an exaggerated number like 32,000 is intended to make people believe that even if the exact figure is not accurate, a large-scale issue must exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This exaggeration is used to defame an entire state based on a few individual cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### The Propaganda of "Love Jihad"

Another "Big Lie" propagated by the film and various [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | media outlets]] is the conspiracy theory of "Love Jihad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This theory claims a concerted effort to forcefully convert women through romantic relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

*   In 2018, after examining 11 cases out of 90 referred by the Kerala government, the NIA found no evidence of forced conversions in cases involving PFI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   In 2020, the Union Home Ministry officially stated in Lok Sabha that no central agency had reported any cases of "Love Jihad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

This conspiracy theory is spread through [[whatsapp_and_media_brainwashing_tactics | WhatsApp forwards]], [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | propaganda news channels]], and politicians' speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. The constant repetition of this lie aims to instill the belief that it holds some truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. The concept of "Love Jihad" is also presented as being against women, implying they are easily manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Broader Impact and Counter-Narratives

The use of [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | propaganda films]] serves a political agenda to provoke conflict between Hindus, Muslims, and Christians for political gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This is reminiscent of Hitler's era, where many [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | propaganda films]] were made to distort history, defame Jews, and glorify Aryans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

Despite these efforts, India has shown remarkable resilience against radicalization:

*   **Low ISIS Recruitment:** India has a very low number of ISIS recruits (around 66) compared to countries like France (1,700), Germany (760), and the UK (700), especially considering India has the world's third-largest Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. The ratio of ISIS recruits per million people in India is 0.5, significantly lower than France (18 per million), Belgium (40 per million), and Jordan (315 per million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Effective Agency Response:** Indian agencies like NIA and IB conducted "Operation Pigeon," a de-radicalization program that identified and saved 350 vulnerable Malayali youth from extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Syncretic Culture:** India's syncretic culture, with Muslims living harmoniously alongside Hindus and Christians, contributes to the rejection of extreme ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. ISIS itself reportedly considered the liberal version of Islam practiced in India to be inferior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Role of Muslim Clerics:** Many Muslim clerics have played a positive role, issuing fatwas against militant Jihad (Dar al-Aman) and condemning terrorist organizations like ISIS, Taliban, and Al-Qaeda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

The actual story of Kerala reflects unity in diversity, with people of different religions coexisting peacefully, contributing to the state's top rankings in education, healthcare, and human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This reality stands in stark contrast to the [[propaganda_and_misinformation_regarding_bjp | misleading marketing tactics]] and [[impact_of_political_influence_on_media | political influence on media]] seen in films like "The Kerala Story" that attempt to promote division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Instead of promoting [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | propaganda films]], stories that genuinely address complex issues without spreading lies, such as the Swedish TV series "The Caliphate," can be more insightful and thrilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

North Korea is characterized as the "world's most terrifying dictatorship," where the government exerts extensive [[government_control_over_personal_lives_in_north_korea|control over personal lives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Decisions ranging from residency and occupation to education, clothing, hairstyles, and even entertainment are made by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Citizens' phones are monitored, with their operating systems randomly capturing screenshots and sending them to the government to track activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

## Historical Context and Economic Struggles
North Korea, officially named the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), has a population of approximately 25 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Despite its official name, the country is far from democratic, evident in its satellite imagery at night, which shows darkness compared to the glittering lights of neighboring China and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. People often go to sleep by 7 PM due to the lack of electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Historically, North Korea was more successful than South Korea, with a higher Per Capita GDP than both India and China in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It offered free healthcare, education, housing, heating, and transport, experiencing an average GDP increase of 4.5% annually between 1950 and 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, which had supplied cheap oil and food, led to a severe economic crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The period between 1995 and 1998 saw a major man-made catastrophe: a famine that killed an estimated 500,000 to 2 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. People became so desperate for food that they hunted frogs to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. During this time, the government prioritized covering up the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. In Pyongyang, the capital, homeless and starving individuals were removed to project an image of stable socialism, while people in rural areas starved to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Families often made the tragic decision to let elderly relatives starve so that younger members could survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Today, 69% of the population lives in poverty, lacking basic necessities like food, clean water, education, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. Most men are compelled to work government-assigned jobs, earning meager salaries equivalent to 7-9 kg of corn per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Consequently, women often run families by working in local markets called Jangmadang, contributing over 70% of household income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. These markets, initially black markets, have become the primary source of income and a hub for information about the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

## Government Control and Suppression

North Korea is a family-led totalitarian dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. After World War II, the Korean peninsula was divided, with North Korea falling under Soviet influence and adopting communist ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Kim Il Sung became the first Supreme Leader, and his family, including current leader Kim Jong Un, has ruled ever since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The primary goal of the government is to maintain the Kim family's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Control over Personal Lives
*   **Appearance:** The government dictates clothing and hairstyles, with only 15 approved options for men and 15 for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Kim Jong Un's haircut is exclusive to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Prohibited items include dyed hair, blue, ripped, and skinny jeans, branded clothes, tight dresses, short skirts, sun hats, and red lipstick, all viewed as Western influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. A "Fashion Police" enforces these rules, cutting banned clothes, imposing fines, and even jailing offenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The government views fashion as a cultural invasion that threatens the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

*   **Movement:** People need government permission to travel domestically, with strict bans on international travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Leaving the country without permission is considered a traitorous act, punishable by forced labor, torture, life imprisonment, or death for the entire family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. During COVID, border guards had a "Shoot at Sight" order for unauthorized crossings, resulting in 14 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

*   **Media and Internet:** Foreign movies are banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. TV and radio broadcast only government channels that promote [[propaganda_and_censorship_in_north_korea|propaganda_and_censorship_in_north_korea|propaganda]] praising the regime and depicting Kim Jong Un as a god-like figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Watching foreign shows is a serious crime; two teenagers received 12 years of hard labor for watching and distributing a South Korean drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, and another young man was publicly executed for watching and sharing South Korean films and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Despite this, people secretly smuggle and watch South Korean dramas, often using USB sticks and watching in darkness at low volume to avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

    Internet access is extremely limited, requiring government permission and constant monitoring by librarians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Computers freeze every five minutes, requiring a librarian's fingerprint to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Common people have access only to a highly censored and expensive intranet with few government-approved websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[0:17:50]</a>. Social media is non-existent, and smartphones are heavily censored, unable to make international calls or download apps from an app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

*   **Religion:** North Korea is officially an atheist country, where practicing or preaching religion is punishable by death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Christians are particularly targeted, often imprisoned and tortured, as they are seen as influenced by America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. In 2009, a woman was publicly executed for distributing a Bible, and her family was sent to a political prison camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. The Kim family, especially Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, are worshipped like gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. Their pictures and statues are ubiquitous, and their protection is prioritized even over human lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Social Control and [[guilt_by_association_and_political_prison_camps_in_north_korea|Political Prison Camps]]
The [[guilt_by_association_and_political_prison_camps_in_north_korea|Law of Guilt by Association]] is a cornerstone of the North Korean system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. If an individual commits a political crime, their entire family, up to three generations, can be imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Shin Dong Hyuk, born in Political Prison Camp #14 in 1981, was a victim of this law because his uncle had fled to South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Prison camps, housing 80,000 to 120,000 people across 5-6 facilities, are described as hellish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. Prisoners are starved, forced to work 16-18 hours daily in mines and farms, and often die of hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. They resort to eating grass, rats, snakes, and even pig fodder to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. Escaping or even planning an escape is met with execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Shin Dong Hyuk witnessed his mother and brother executed after he reported their escape plan, hoping for extra food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

[[economy_and_forced_labor_in_north_korea|Forced labor]] is rampant and forms the backbone of North Korea's [[economy_and_forced_labor_in_north_korea|economy]], as most funds are directed towards weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Prisoners work 12-18 hours daily in construction, farms, mines, and factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Approximately 100,000 North Koreans are also sent abroad for forced labor in countries like Russia, China, and Africa, where they are exploited as slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

The **Songbun system** divides the population into three classes based on political loyalty: Core (loyalists), Wavering (unsure/suspected), and Hostile (enemies of the government) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. This system dictates where people live, their occupations, food rations, healthcare, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. For instance, only the Core class is allowed to live in Pyongyang, where most resources are concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. A political crime by any family member can lead to the entire family's Songbun class being demoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

The **Secret Police** is the root cause of major human rights violations, responsible for disappearances, torture, and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. Its agents, spies, and informants are ubiquitous, forcing individuals, especially from the Hostile class, to spy on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. This fosters deep distrust, even among family members, preventing open discussion of sensitive issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. The secret police divides areas into groups of 30-40 houses, each with a neighborhood association that encourages spying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

## Weakening Grip and Hope for Change
Despite its formidable nature, Kim Jong Un's grip on power has shown signs of weakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
*   **Jangmadang (Black Markets):** These markets, primarily run by women, have become indispensable to daily life, providing a means for people to earn money when the government fails to provide food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. The government's attempts to suppress them have failed, even leading to public outrage in 2009 when a currency re-evaluation backfired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. The unity demonstrated by the people in these markets undermined the government's ability to divide them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

*   **Foreign Media Exposure:** Through Jangmadang, access to foreign media, particularly South Korean dramas, has increased exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. This exposure is shattering the government's [[propaganda_and_censorship_in_north_korea|propaganda]], revealing the truth about the outside world to a growing number of North Koreans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. The shared risk of engaging in illegal activities like watching foreign films fosters trust and unity among people, undermining the government's pervasive spying and distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.

*   **Corruption:** Bribery has become a way of life, with government officials relying on bribes for income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. This widespread corruption erodes fear of dictatorial rules, as people realize many illegal activities can be overlooked with payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.

These factors, while nascent, suggest a silent revolution led by North Korean women, hinting at a potential shift in the country's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. The history of North Korea's dictatorship serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of freedom, unity, and retaining personal autonomy from governmental overreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

The film *The Kerala Story* and its associated video went viral, garnering nearly 15 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite many attempts to counter its claims, no factual mistakes were found in a 22-minute video that analyzed the film's premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This analysis stated that the film's figure of 32,000 conversions was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Debunking Claims and Official Confirmations

The video presented evidence from the Home Ministry, NIA, American Department of State, Observer Researcher Foundation, and numerous news articles to show that the number of Indians who left India to join ISIS was around 60-65 individuals, with only 22 from Kerala, of whom 6 were women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Of these six women, three were Muslim, and the remaining three were converts (two Christians, one Hindu) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

On May 18, the Supreme Court of India confirmed these facts, stating that the situation depicted in the film was not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Consequently, the Supreme Court ordered a disclaimer to be issued before the film when shown in cinemas. This disclaimer must state: "There is no authentic data to back up the suggestion that the figure of conversion is 32,000 or any other figure," and "This film represents a fictionalized version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Cinematic Liberty vs. Misinformation

Some counter-arguments against the debunking of *The Kerala Story* claimed that the film's figures, even if not explicitly stated as being from Kerala, referred to a general number of women buried in deserts, and that fictionalizing things is an act of cinematic liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

However, the film's director, Sudipto Sen, had explicitly claimed that the 32,000 figure referred to Hindu and Christian women from Kerala who were buried by ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. The film's producer, director, and actress all claimed in real-life interviews and on social media that the story of 32,000 girls was true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Such actions are described as lying rather than cinematic liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

### Comparison with *Border*

A contrast is drawn between *The Kerala Story* and the film *Border*. While *Border* is praised as a brilliant film that portrays patriotism and humanity, moving people to tears and sensitizing them towards humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, *The Kerala Story* is criticized for instilling hatred. After watching *The Kerala Story*, people have been observed insulting all Muslims, fostering an "us versus them" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

It is argued that cinematic liberty does not permit the creation of conspiracies, the exaggeration of figures from 3 to 32,000, or the defamation of an entire state and community based on a few isolated cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Such practices are labeled as "vulgar, hateful [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | propaganda]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. This highlights the [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | role of media and misinformation in shaping public opinion]] and the distinction between creative expression and the dissemination of harmful [[claims_of_spreading_hatred_and_misinformation | claims of spreading hatred and misinformation]].

## Logical Fallacies in Countering Claims

Counter-arguments against the debunking of *The Kerala Story* often employed logical fallacies:

*   **Ad Hominem Fallacy**: Instead of criticizing the arguments presented in the debunking video, critics attacked the character of the video's creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This involved searching for alleged mistakes in old videos to discredit the current argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Misinterpretation**: Critics distorted the meaning of words, such as "only" when referring to the actual number of women (3) compared to the exaggerated figure (32,000). The word "only" was used to emphasize the stark difference from the widely circulated lie, not to diminish the tragedy of the actual cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Strawman Fallacy**: Critics misrepresented the video's stance on organizations like PFI, claiming that because the video did not extensively discuss PFI, it implied support for Muslim extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This created a false argument to attack, similar to equating a ban on an organization with an insult to a deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Argument from Personal Experience**: One criticism suggested that the video's creator, not living in an area with a large Muslim population, was not qualified to comment on Hindu-Muslim issues in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. This disregards the role of research, factual gathering, and diverse sources in informing opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

These examples illustrate how [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | propaganda techniques in media]] and the spread of [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | media bias and misinformation in Indian politics]] can rely on flawed reasoning rather than factual engagement.

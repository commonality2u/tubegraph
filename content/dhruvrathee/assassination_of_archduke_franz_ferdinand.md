On June 28, 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, a 19-year-old student assassinated the Austro-Hungarian Prince, Archduke Franz Ferdinand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This single incident is often cited as the trigger for [[causes_of_world_war_i | World War I]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, a conflict that lasted four years and resulted in over 20 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Background to the Assassination

The complex chain of events leading up to the assassination involved several European powers and the volatile Balkan region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### The Balkan Countries and Ottoman Decline
In 1914, Europe's map featured large empires like the Austro-Hungarian, German, Russian, and Ottoman Empires, alongside countries such as the United Kingdom and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Most European countries at this time were monarchies, with only France, Switzerland, and San Marino operating as democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Eastern European nations, including Serbia, Bosnia, Romania, and Bulgaria, were collectively known as the Balkan Countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### The Treaty of Berlin and Annexation of Bosnia
The story begins in 1878 with a war between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, where Russia supported the Balkan countries in their separation from the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The war concluded with the Treaty of Berlin in 1878 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Under this treaty, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was granted temporary administrative rights over the Bosnia-Herzegovina region, though it officially remained part of the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

However, in October 1908, the Austro-Hungarian Empire annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This act angered the Bosnian people, who desired freedom, and their neighboring country, Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Many people in these Eastern European countries, sharing a Slavic ethnicity, felt a strong connection and even advocated for a unified South Slavic Nation, eventually known as Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Serbia argued that the annexation was an invasion of the South Slavs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Failed Diplomatic Maneuvers
Before the annexation, Austria-Hungary's foreign minister sought Russia's agreement not to object in exchange for Russia's annexation of the region around the Strait of Bosphorus, connecting the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, domestic protests in Russia, due to the large Slavic population, forced the Russian foreign minister to support Serbia despite the secret agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

In 1909, Austria-Hungary sought Germany's commitment to help if Russia intervened in an attack on Serbia, which Germany agreed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Russia then approached France for support against a potential Austro-Hungarian and German alliance against Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. France, however, refused to interfere, stating it had no interest in Bosnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. France's refusal led Russia to accept the annexation of Bosnia, temporarily averting a major war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### The Young Bosnia Movement
The Bosnians did not meekly accept the annexation; a new revolutionary movement called "Young Bosnia," composed of students and aided by Serbians, emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Their goal was to achieve independence for Bosnia-Herzegovina and unite it with Serbia to form a United South Slavic nation, Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## The Assassination Day: June 28, 1914

On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the prince of Austro-Hungary, visited the annexed territory in Bosnia with his wife, Sophie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Six Bosnian revolutionaries planned their assassination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Around 10 AM, a revolutionary named Cabrinovic threw a bomb near Ferdinand's car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]ç‚–. The bomb bounced off the car and exploded in a side street, injuring 20 people, but Ferdinand escaped unharmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The meeting Ferdinand was attending was canceled, and they decided to go to the hospital to visit the injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

On the way to the hospital, their car mistakenly took a wrong turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. As they tried to correct their route, they found themselves just five feet away from another revolutionary, Gavrilo Princip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Princip, a 19-year-old student, shot both Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, assassinating the Austro-Hungarian Prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Aftermath of the Assassination
Gavrilo Princip was immediately arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. As he was two months short of 20 years old, he could not be given the death sentence according to the law and was instead sentenced to 20 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. During his trial, Princip stated he was a Yugoslav Nationalist aiming to unite the South Slavs, and specifically wanted Bosnia to be free from Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The assassination enraged the emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, leading him to declare war on Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This act initiated a complex chain reaction involving several major powers, which had previously formed [[alliances_and_international_relations_before_world_war_i | alliances and international relations before World War I]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Russia intervened to protect Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, Germany supported Austria-Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, and France joined in support of Russia and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This sequence of events, sometimes referred to as the "Chain of Friendship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, ultimately escalated into [[causes_of_world_war_i | World War I]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

The [[overview_of_the_911_attacks | September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks "shook America to the core" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> and are described as a day that "perhaps changed the world forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Even two decades later, the effects of this day can be seen in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Attacks
On the morning of September 11, 2001:
*   **American Airlines Flight 11** took off from Boston and was hijacked by five individuals, including Mohamed Atta, who was trained as a pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The plane was crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **United Airlines Flight 175** was also hijacked by five individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> and crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center just 17 minutes after the first crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **American Airlines Flight 77**, with five hijackers aboard, was rerouted towards Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> and crashed into The Pentagon, the headquarters of the US Department of Defense, at 9:37 am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **United Airlines Flight 93**, carrying four hijackers, was heading towards Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> and was suspected to be targeting the White House or the US Capitol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Passengers learned about the earlier crashes and bravely fought the hijackers, causing the plane to crash-land in an empty field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed at 9:59 am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, followed by the North Tower at 10:28 am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

Over 3,000 people died and more than 6,000 were injured across these incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The terrorist group Al Qaeda was behind the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Osama bin Laden initially denied responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, but later acknowledged and took responsibility in a 2004 public tape recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. He justified the attacks by citing US interference in the Middle East, support for Israel, actions against Muslims in Lebanon, support for Russia against Muslims in Chechnya, sanctions against Iraq, and the presence of US troops in Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The 9/11 Commission report named Pakistani terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the principal architect of the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## [[Impact on USA and Global Security Measures | Long-term Effects on Global Politics]]

### Changes in Legislation and Government Surveillance
Just six weeks after [[overview_of_the_911_attacks | 9/11]], the US Congress rapidly passed the [[changes_in_legislation_post_911 | PATRIOT Act]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Many politicians had not read the bill, and there was no proper discussion or amendments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This Act granted the US government "boundless power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, allowing it to spy on citizens, secretly access records, and reduce the power of the Judiciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Critics argued the government used the Act and the terrorist threat as an excuse to silence dissenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. In 2013, Edward Snowden exposed widespread surveillance by the US government, including the NSA's daily collection of phone records without warrants or public knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

### Airport Security Norms
Before 2001, airport security was minimal, often involving only ID checks and basic metal detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, and passengers could arrive 15-30 minutes before a flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. After [[overview_of_the_911_attacks | 9/11]], everything changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>:
*   Full-body scans and mandatory personal ID/passport checks became common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   New procedures for bag checks, including removing laptops and restricting liquid quantities, were implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   Explosive detection systems were deployed nationwide in the US after December 2002 and later worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   Pilots were armed, and cockpit doors were reinforced to protect against intrusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### US Foreign Policy and the "War on Terror"
Following [[overview_of_the_911_attacks | 9/11]], US interference in the Middle East intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   The US invaded Afghanistan to seek out terrorist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, remaining for 20 years, resulting in trillions of taxpayer dollars wasted and many US soldiers and civilians killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   The US also invaded Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   The US's "War on Terror" has been criticized for being synonymous with torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, leading to more people choosing terrorism out of anger or revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

### [[Rise in Xenophobia and Hate Crimes after the Attacks | Rise in Xenophobia and Hate Crimes]]
After [[overview_of_the_911_attacks | 9/11]], attacks on Muslims increased, leading to a new wave of [[rise_in_xenophobia_and_hate_crimes_after_the_attacks | xenophobia]] against Muslims and South Asians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. In 2001, 481 hate crimes against Muslims occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Sikhs were also targeted due to misconceptions about their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Balbir Singh Sodhi, who had donated to [[overview_of_the_911_attacks | 9/11]] victims, was killed on September 15 while planting flowers outside his gas station in Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Some Sikhs shaved their beards and stopped wearing turbans due to security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Broader Lessons

> [!NOTE] Extremism Breeds Extremism
> The events of [[overview_of_the_911_attacks | 9/11]] and the subsequent global response illustrate the lesson that "extremism breeds extremism" and "an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. The cycle of revenge, where actions by one side lead to retaliatory acts by another, creates an "endless downward spiral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. The killing of one terrorist can inadvertently create another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>; for example, despite Osama bin Laden's death, organizations like ISIS have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Government Exploitation
> It is crucial to never allow any government to use an act of terrorism as an excuse to exploit its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The US government exploited its citizens significantly after [[overview_of_the_911_attacks | 9/11]] through surveillance and the [[changes_in_legislation_post_911 | PATRIOT Act]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. It is important not to be so blinded by fear that one stops seeing reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

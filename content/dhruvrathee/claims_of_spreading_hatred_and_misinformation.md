This is denied as a lie, attributing it to a common Telegram bug years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Team Size**: Elvish claimed Dhruv Rathee's team consisted of only three people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Dhruv Rathee stated his team has 10-15 members and criticized Elvish's basic counting abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Promoting Fake Cryptocurrency**: Elvish accused Dhruv Rathee of promoting a scam cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Dhruv Rathee clarified that due diligence was performed at the time (October 2021), including checking investors and newspaper advertorials.

Dhruv Rathee clarified that the song was by Vishal Dadlani, but he re-edited it out of passion and supported AAP voluntarily as a student due to his interest in politics during the India Against Corruption movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Dhruv Rathee clarified he stated Aurangzeb was an opportunist who pretended to be secular or communal depending on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Dictatorial Tendencies**: Elvish implied PM Modi isn't a dictator by sharing memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a> and accused Dhruv Rathee of being a dictator for blocking rude trolls on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## Elvish Yadav's Role in Spreading Hatred and Misinformation

Elvish Yadav's actions are presented as examples of [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | the role of media and misinformation in shaping public opinion]] and [[role_of_media_in_spreading_mass_hysteria | mass hysteria]]:

*   **Opportunism and Hypocrisy**: Elvish Yadav is described as an opportunist who shifts between being secular and communal based on benefit, similar to Aurangzeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. He is shown to engage in friendly interactions with a Muslim influencer (Munawar Farooqui) for publicity, only to later return to spreading hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Promoting Harmful Content**: Unlike Dhruv Rathee who refuses to promote gambling, tobacco, Chinese companies, or fast food/soft drinks due to their harmful impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:06:03]</a>, Elvish Yadav reportedly promotes betting apps and other harmful substances for payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Religious Insensitivity and Hatred**:
    *   Using Lord Ram's name and Hindu symbols for "cheap theatrics" and promoting apps that objectify women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
    *   Mocking Hindu mantras and Hanuman Chalisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.
    *   Selling merchandise (hoodies) with distorted Hindu scriptures and misattributing phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. This highlights issues with [[whatsapp_misinformation_and_its_impact_on_society | WhatsApp misinformation and its impact on society]].
    *   Displaying a Twitter cover picture of a villainous character from the film "Shaurya" who harbored hatred for all Muslims and wanted to kill them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. This points to [[role_of_propaganda_and_misinformation_in_film | propaganda and misinformation in film]] and its influence.
    *   Morphed the "All Eyes On Rafah" image to "All Eyes On POK," implying that suffering in Rafah is acceptable due to atrocities in POK, instead of condemning injustice universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
    *   Failure to speak out against genocide calls in religious gatherings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>, or injustices against women, or issues like Manipur and Kashmiri Pandits unless it benefits him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Hero-Worshipping and Political Alignment**: Elvish Yadav's praise for PM Modi and Smriti Irani is highlighted as an example of [[the_role_of_misinformation_in_political_support_for_pm_modi | the role of misinformation in political support for PM Modi]] and [[propaganda_and_misinformation_regarding_bjp | propaganda and misinformation regarding BJP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. His actions are seen as driven by money and fame rather than ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. The phenomenon of BJP supporters abusing Hindus from Ayodhya after the party's loss demonstrates that their only religion is "worshipping Modi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
*   **Misogyny**: Elvish Yadav is criticized for calling a woman a "witch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>, objectifying salesgirls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>, and making inappropriate comments about women to his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

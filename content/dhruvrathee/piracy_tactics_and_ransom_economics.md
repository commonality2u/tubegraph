[[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]] have been perceived as villains by the world, but as heroes or "Robin Hoods" by many Somalians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Their rise was fueled by severe food and job shortages, making piracy the only means for young boys to provide for their households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>

Initially, [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]] used ordinary fishing boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. As they accumulated wealth from their activities, they acquired speedboats, tracking devices, and more effective weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. By 1997, it became difficult to target foreign fishing ships because these vessels began hiring local warlords as armed guards, often equipped with anti-aircraft guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This development led pirates to shift their focus to larger commercial cargo ships, which typically lacked armed security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Hijacking Process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>

Pirate hijackings typically involve:
*   **Approach and Intimidation** The pirates would approach a targeted ship, waving weapons and hoping the crew would stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. If the ship did not stop, they often fired warning shots into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Boarding** Pirates carried rope ladders with hooks to latch onto the ship and climb aboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. The most challenging part of the operation was getting close enough, hooking the ladder, and climbing onto the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. This attempt was not always successful, with a success rate of only 20-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
*   **Control** Once aboard, most crews would not resist because only the pirates possessed weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. The entire process could take as little as 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   **Weapons** Pirates were armed with various weapons, from AK-47s to rocket launchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. An example of their weaponry includes the AK-47 rifle carried by pirate leader Abdiwali Abdiqadir Musi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Defensive Measures by Ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>

Ships would attempt to evade pirates by increasing speed, though this was only effective if the pirates were far away, as pirate speedboats could travel at over 25 knots compared to a large ship's 18-20 knots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Other defense methods included water hoses to prevent boarding, though these were not very effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Crews often used safe rooms for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

Captain Phillips' crew employed a tactic where the helmsman would rock the ship, causing the pirates' boat to sink and preventing their escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Ransom Economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>

Once a ship was hijacked, it was steered to a "friendly port" in Somalia, where guards and translators would manage the hostages while ransom demands were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The ransom was typically paid through banks in London and Dubai and delivered to the ship's deck via parachutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Upon receiving the money, the ship and crew would be released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

### Financial Structure of Piracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>

Piracy evolved into an organized industry with a clear business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. It involved:
*   **Organizers and Recruiters** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>
*   **Financiers and Investors** who provided capital for necessary equipment like boats, oil, weapons, and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. According to a 2011 UN Nippon Foundation report, financiers would provide $30,000 for high seas operations and $10,000 for those in the Gulf of Aden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Mission Commanders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>
*   **Ground Support, Negotiators, and Bankers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>

### Ransom Distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>

The ransom money was divided as follows:
*   **Hijackers** Half of the money went to the pirates directly involved in the hijacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Investors** One-third was allocated to the investors who funded the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Support Staff** The remaining amount was distributed among guards and translators who looked after the hostages, as well as banknote checkers who verified the authenticity of the cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **Community Charity** In some cases, a portion of the money was distributed as charity to the local poor and disabled community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

### Financial Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>

By 2008, piracy became Somalia's most productive industry, generating $50 million within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Between 2005 and 2012, pirates earned an estimated $339 million to $413 million in ransom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Individual pirates could receive $30,000 to $75,000 per hijacking, with an additional $10,000 bonus for the first pirate to board a ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

In 2011, at its peak, [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]] caused a global economic loss of $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Ransom amounts for specific incidents include $3 million for the Saudi super-tanker Sirius Star in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a> and $9.5 million for the Greek tanker Smyrni in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. These ransoms were typically paid by private shipping companies, some of which had "Kidnap and Ransom Insurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. In a few instances, governments also paid the ransom amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## Decline of Piracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>

Piracy incidents significantly declined from 237 in 2011 to only 15 in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This was largely due to:
*   **Deployment of Armed Security Guards** on commercial vessels, making it challenging for pirates to hijack ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Technological Improvements** in commercial ships, including increased speed, barbed wires on lower decks, secure safe rooms, foam machines, high-powered water cannons, and sonic devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **International Naval Missions** such as America's Task Force 151, and counter-piracy efforts by the European Union, NATO, China, Russia, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Social Disruption** within Somalian clans, as pirates buying luxury cars and engaging with drugs disrupted traditional cultural norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

From 2017 to 2023, successful cargo ship hijackings became rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. However, the [[global_efforts_to_combat_piracy_in_somalia | Hamas-Israel war]] in 2023 diverted US Navy ships patrolling the area towards Yemen's Houthi rebels, which [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]] saw as an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This led to new incidents, including the hijacking of the MV Roen in December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> and a Bangladeshi ship in March 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. In November 2024, a Chinese fishing ship was hijacked, notably with its security guards joining the pirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

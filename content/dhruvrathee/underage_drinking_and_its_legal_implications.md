On the night of May 18th, 2024, a tragic incident in Pune highlighted critical issues surrounding underage drinking, reckless driving, and the justice system in India. A 17-year-old boy, Vedant, who was under the influence of alcohol, caused a fatal accident, killing two IT professionals, Aneesh and Ashwini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This case brought to light the complexities of [[juvenile_justice_in_india_and_its_challenges | juvenile justice]] and the potential influence of wealth and connections on legal proceedings.

## The Incident: A Timeline of Underage Drinking and Fatal Driving

On the night of the accident, Vedant and his 12 friends met at a pub called Cosie in Pune around 10:40 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Within 1.5 hours, their bill reached ₹48,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. CCTV footage showed Vedant and his friends drinking alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It is crucial to note that Vedant was under the age of 18, significantly younger than the minimum drinking age limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Around midnight, Cosie stopped serving Vedant and his friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. They then proceeded to another club, Blak, at Marriott Suites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. At approximately 2:00 AM, Vedant and two friends left Club Blak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Despite being intoxicated, Vedant got into his electric Porsche Taycan with his driver also present in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

At around 2:30 AM, while Aneesh and Ashwini were returning home on a motorcycle, Vedant's Porsche, reportedly traveling at speeds between 160 kmph and 200 kmph on a small road, collided with their motorcycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Both Aneesh and Ashwini died instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Vedant was subsequently handed over to the police by onlookers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Legal Implications and Controversies

### Initial FIR and Section Discrepancies
An FIR was filed against Vedant at 8:26 AM on May 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The initial charges were filed under Section 304A (Death by Negligence) of the Indian Penal Code, which carries a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Critics argued it should have been Section 304 (Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder), which applies when one knows their actions could lead to death and carries a maximum punishment of 10 years imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The choice of section raised questions about potential influence, especially given the early presence of MLA Sunil Tingre at the police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Blood Sample Tampering
A major fraud was uncovered concerning Vedant's blood test. The sample taken at 11:00 AM, approximately 8 hours after the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, was negative for alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It was later revealed that doctors Dr. Ajay Taware and Dr. Shrihari Halnor at the hospital threw the real blood sample and replaced it with another clean sample after being bribed with ₹300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Both doctors have since been arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Bail and Public Outcry
The [[juvenile_justice_in_india_and_its_challenges | Juvenile Justice Board]] initially granted Vedant bail, with the condition that he study traffic rules, prepare a presentation, and write a 300-word essay on road accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This decision sparked widespread national outrage, leading to social media protests and calls for justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Action Against Pub Owners and Parents
Under public pressure, the police booked the owners and managers of Club Cosie and Blak restaurant for serving alcohol to a minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Vedant's father, Vishal Agarwal, was also charged under Section 75 (willful neglect of a child or exposing a child to mental or physical illness) and Section 77 (supplying a child with intoxicating liquor or drugs) of the [[juvenile_justice_in_india_and_its_challenges | Juvenile Justice Act]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Additionally, sections of the Motor Vehicles Act were cited for allowing Vedant to drive without a license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Vedant's mother requested their driver to take the blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, and his grandfather threatened the driver to admit he was driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Vishal Agarwal attempted to evade authorities after his son's bail but was arrested in Aurangabad on May 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

On May 22nd, Vedant was again produced in court, and Section 185 (driving under the influence of alcohol) was invoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The police requested the court to try Vedant as an adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. He has been remanded to Nehru Udyog Kendra Observation Home until June 5th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## The Juvenile Justice Act and its Challenges

The case highlights a legal technicality within the [[juvenile_justice_in_india_and_its_challenges | Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act, 2015]]. This amendment, introduced after the Nirbhaya case, allows for individuals aged 16-18 who commit "heinous crimes" (minimum imprisonment of 7 years) to be tried as adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

However, Section 304 of the IPC, despite a maximum sentence of 10 years, does not specify a *minimum* sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This technicality means that crimes under Section 304 do not automatically fall under the "heinous crime" category for juvenile trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This loophole has previously allowed minors, even repeat offenders nearing 18, to avoid adult trials, as seen in a 2016 Delhi case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, and a Kanpur case in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

The concept of Doli Incapax, or the age of criminal responsibility, posits that children below a certain age cannot intentionally commit crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. While the philosophy aims for reform rather than punishment for such children, the speaker argues that for individuals like Vedant, who come from privileged backgrounds and have access to resources and education, they should be tried as adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Parental Responsibility
The transcript suggests that if the law struggles to punish 15-17-year-old criminals, the responsibility for their actions should be shifted to their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. This includes parents who allow underage driving without licenses, whose "bad parenting" contributes to such crimes, and whose intentional mistakes lead to loss of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The Pune Porsche case exposes systemic issues within the country's justice system, highlighting how wealth and connections can seemingly influence outcomes. Instances of driving without proper registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, underage drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, and attempts to bribe officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> illustrate a perception that for the rich, "everything is legal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

However, the widespread public outrage and collective voice on social media have pressured authorities to take stricter actions in this case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The arrests of the doctors involved in blood sample tampering are seen as a direct result of this public pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This incident underscores the power of public unity in holding the corrupt system accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

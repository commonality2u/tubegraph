This article explores the personal philosophies developed by the speaker throughout his life and how various forms of media have influenced his perspectives and career choices.

## Personal Philosophies

The speaker's life journey reveals several core philosophies that guided his decisions and approach to work.

### The 80-20 Rule (Pareto Principle)

The speaker subconsciously applied the 80-20 rule in his academic life, aiming for "good enough" scores rather than perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. He found that achieving 80% marks required significantly less effort than the remaining 20% to reach 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This philosophy, later formally learned, suggests that one doesn't need to be 100% perfect in everything; putting in minimum effort for 80% perfection is often sufficient for many aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. He applies this strategy to manage his YouTube channels and travel simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

### Passion, Consistency, and Discipline

The speaker emphasizes that when one is passionate about something and genuinely enjoys doing it, it becomes easier to maintain consistency and discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. While effort and hard work are still necessary, the process is comparatively simpler when driven by passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

### Focus on Capability and Excellence

Echoing a dialogue from the movie "3 Idiots," the speaker believes in studying and working to become capable rather than chasing success directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. He states, "Don't chase success. Excellence, chase excellence. And success will follow you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Throughout his YouTube career, his focus has been on continuous self-improvement, enhancing video quality, and effectively conveying his message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

### Healthy Living

The speaker developed an "obsession with eating healthy" early in life, influenced by cartoons like Popeye, which promoted spinach and vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This led him to stop consuming soft drinks like Pepsi and Coca-Cola at the age of 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Influence of Media

Media played a significant role in shaping the speaker's interests, perceptions, and career trajectory.

### Early Exposure to Video and Animation

The speaker's first video was created in 2003 using a webcam by stitching together 24 photos per second, teaching him about frame rates and the concept of animated films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He used clay to create stop-motion animations, known as Claymation, at 8-9 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

The speaker notes a contrast in cartoons from his childhood versus modern ones. While his generation's cartoons, like Popeye, promoted healthy eating (spinach), contemporary cartoons often promote unhealthy food, such as laddoos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Political Awakening through Media

The speaker's interest in politics began in December 2011, during the anti-corruption protests led by Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The [[role_of_media_politicians_and_public_response_in_controversies | largely positive media coverage of these protests]] sparked his initial political engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. He observed that such positive coverage for protests is "impossible to imagine nowadays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

His political interest deepened with the formation of the AAP government in Delhi (Arvind Kejriwal's 49-day government) and Narendra Modi becoming Prime Minister in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Initially, his political ideology was "100% anti-Congress," driven by the [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | narrative set by the media and TV channels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Realization of Media Manipulation

Over time, the speaker realized the "level to which the media could fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. He observed that promises of bringing back black money and ending corruption were not fulfilled, and instead, RTI (Right to Information) was diluted, foreign funding for political parties was legalized, and corruption continued, albeit hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. He concluded that [[impact_of_political_influence_on_media | media would be bought]] to control narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This frustration led him to publish his initial videos on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### YouTube as a Platform

His fascination with YouTube began in 2014, months after meeting his now-wife Juli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. His childhood interest in making videos naturally led him to use this platform, eventually uploading content regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Initially, his parents and he doubted YouTube as a viable career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, but after 2017-2018, he prioritized YouTube as his passion, placing education second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

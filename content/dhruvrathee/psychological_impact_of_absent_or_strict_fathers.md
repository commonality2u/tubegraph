The absence of a father's love, whether due to his physical absence or an excessively strict upbringing, can lead to significant [[psychological_theories_and_identity | psychological issues]] in a child, which may evolve into severe problems in adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This phenomenon is not fictional and has been substantiated by numerous research papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Effects of Father's Absence

Studies consistently indicate that a father's absence diminishes a child's self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Furthermore, research suggests that the absence of a caring father can contribute to an individual becoming a criminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Effects of Strict Parenting

Other studies show a link between harsh parenting and excessive strictness during childhood and the development of aggressive behavior in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Low self-confidence and aggression are common traits observed in people, which can be linked to these upbringing patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Environmental Influence on Development

A person's behavior, personality, and [[psychological_theories_and_identity | identity]] are molded by their surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These factors include:
*   Parental care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
*   Interactions with relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
*   Experiences with teachers and friends at school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>
*   Exposure to the general environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>
*   Mass media, including news, books, radio, TV ads, social media, songs, and movies, significantly influences the formation of identity and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

While some aspects of life are consciously controlled, everything has a subconscious effect on the mind that may not be immediately recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Just as one unhealthy meal may not cause a heart attack, but a consistent diet of unhealthy food increases risk, individual exposures to problematic content incrementally affect the psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Positive and negative changes accumulate throughout a person's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

For instance, a child named Munnu, growing up in a household where his father beats his mother and applies restrictive rules to his sister while following YouTubers and social media creators like Andrew Tate who objectify women and promote toxic masculinity, will be significantly influenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Even popular song lyrics and television ads contribute to this narrative of women's objectification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. UNICEF has highlighted a report by the American Psychological Association on how such objectification in mass media contributes to violence against women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Cinematic Portrayals

This sensitive topic has been explored in various films:
*   **The White Ribbon**: Honored with Best Film at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, International Critics Prize, Best Film at the European Film Awards, over 10 German Film Awards, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Ardh Satya** (Govind Nihalani) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   **Udaan** (Vikramaditya Motwane) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

### Critique of 'Animal' (2023)

The film 'Animal,' directed by Sandeep Vanga Reddy, attempts to address the theme of "daddy issues" but has been criticized for its problematic depiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The protagonist, Ranvijay, is portrayed as having lacked his father's love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, yet he exhibits the same neglect towards his own children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

The film has been labeled a "cringe-fest cancerous for our society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> due to:
*   **Glorification of violence and misogyny**: Ranvijay commits mass murders, abuses his wife, mocks menstruation, and tells his wife it's "a man's world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The director, Sandeep Vanga, stated in an interview that true love involves the liberty of hitting one's partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Lack of character redemption**: Despite being portrayed with "daddy issues," Ranvijay shows no positive transformation or mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, leading to the glorification of misogyny and toxic masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Promotion of negative archetypes**: The protagonist's confident display of aggression and violence aligns with the modern concept of an [[perceptions_of_masculinity_and_alpha_males | alpha male]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This contrasts with positive role models of masculinity like Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

Such films contribute to a toxic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. When films like 'Kabir Singh' and 'Animal' are criticized, their fans often exhibit outrage because they find validation in these toxic narratives, feeling their own personality is being criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

Aamir Khan noted that directors "not very talented creatively, in creating a story, in showing emotions," often "depend heavily on violence and s*x to make their films work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. While realistic films depicting violence's negative societal impact struggle at the box office, films that glamorize violence for entertainment, particularly from a hero's standpoint, are commercially successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. This capitalizes on an audience's subconscious craving to envision themselves as powerful, violent characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

### Conclusion

Characters like Kabir Singh and Ranvijay, who lack self-control and resort to violence when angered, cannot serve as positive role models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. Those who appreciate such regressive characters often identify as "Macho Man" or, more recently, "[[perceptions_of_masculinity_and_alpha_males | Alpha Male]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Embracing such destructive thinking and consuming media that glorifies it is detrimental to one's mind and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

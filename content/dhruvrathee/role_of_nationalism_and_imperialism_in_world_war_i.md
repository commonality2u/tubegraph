While the [[assassination_of_archduke_franz_ferdinand | assassination of Austro-Hungarian Prince Franz Ferdinand]] on June 28, 1914, by a 19-year-old student, is often cited as the trigger for World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, the conflict was actually the culmination of a long and complex chain of reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This global war, which lasted four years and resulted in over 20 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, was primarily fueled by aggressive nationalism and rampant imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## European Political Landscape Before the War

In 1914, most European countries were monarchies ruled by emperors and kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Only France, Switzerland, and San Marino were democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The prevailing political structure meant that the wishes of the rulers, rather than public opinion, dictated national policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Notably, the rulers of Germany (Kaiser Wilhelm II), Russia (Tsar Nicholas II), and Britain (King George V) were first cousins, making World War I, in a sense, a "family feud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Aggressive Nationalism

The nationalism prevalent in Europe during this period was distinct from a nationalism for liberation or independence. It was a form of **racial nationalism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, fostering a belief in one's own country's superiority and an aggressive attitude towards other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Rulers and emperors shrewdly exploited this sentiment to rally their populations for war, often in pursuit of imperialistic ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Otto von Bismarck, for instance, had united Germany in 1871 based on similar nationalist principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

The concept of "country" often referred specifically to the monarch or the ruling elite, rather than the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. People were convinced to fight for their "country," which effectively meant fighting for the ruler's agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Imperialism and Colonial Expansion

Imperialism, the desire to capture and occupy other countries, was a major catalyst for the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Monarchs sought to expand their empires for pride, power, and to exploit resources like gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. By the 1900s, capitalist countries also engaged in this "looting" process, seeking raw materials and cheap labor for greater profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This led some to characterize imperialism as "the highest stage of capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

Henry Ford, the founder of the Ford company, famously noted that war could not be waged without capitalism, and capitalism could not be waged without war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. To facilitate imperial expansion, countries poured massive funds into their militaries. The combined military spending of the six great powers (Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Italy) quadrupled from Â£94 million in 1870 to significantly more by 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Britain's Royal Navy, the largest in the world, was essential for maintaining its vast empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## [[alliances_and_international_relations_before_world_war_i | Alliances and International Relations]]

The imperialistic rivalries and constant worry about other nations gaining territory led to the formation of complex political [[alliances_and_international_relations_before_world_war_i | alliances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The Triple Alliance (Germany, Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Italy, formed in 1882) and the Triple Entente (Great Britain, France, and Russia, formed in 1907) were prime examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. These treaties obligated mutual support, escalating regional conflicts into continent-wide wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. For example, when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, Russia moved to defend Serbia. Germany then supported Austria-Hungary, and France backed Russia, creating a "Chain of Friendship" that rapidly engulfed Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## [[public_opinion_and_antiwar_movements_during_world_war_i | Public Opinion and Anti-War Movements]]

Despite the pervasive imperialistic and nationalistic fervor among rulers, the common people largely did not desire World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Soldiers were often recruited from the poor and unemployed, seeking work and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. To motivate them to fight wars of conquest rather than defense, extensive propaganda was used to glorify war and soldiering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Newspapers and media portrayed enlistment as a noble, selfless service, transforming soldiers into disciplined heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Even military failures, such as the Crimean War's "Charge of the Light Brigade," were exaggerated and romanticized by poets like Alfred Tennyson to inspire patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

However, many opposed the war. Socialist parties in America, Italy, Britain (Labour Party), and Russia (Bolsheviks) were against the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Anarchists and Syndicalists advocated for internationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Figures like Henry Ford and Valentine Bulgakov opposed the war on religious and humanitarian grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Poets such as Rudyard Kipling, Wilfred Owen, and Thomas Hardy wrote works highlighting the brutal realities and senselessness of war, contrasting the propaganda with the suffering of soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

The widespread reluctance to fight for imperial ambitions was evident in cases of mutinies, like a French battalion refusing to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, and most notably, the Christmas Truce of 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. During this unofficial ceasefire, British and German soldiers celebrated Christmas together on the battlefield, exchanging food and singing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. This event underscored the lack of personal enmity among common soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Despite this, commanders forced soldiers back into combat, punishing those who refused to fight or deserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

Ultimately, [[causes_of_world_war_i | World War I]] was not merely triggered by a single event, but by deep-seated imperialistic ambitions, aggressive nationalistic ideologies, and a web of military [[alliances_and_international_relations_before_world_war_i | alliances]] that characterized early 20th-century Europe.

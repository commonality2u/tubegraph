Fraudulent activities, particularly those perpetrated by conmen disguised as spiritual leaders, continue to be a pervasive issue across various religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While some people pursue academic or professional careers like becoming IITians, scientists, or IAS officers, there's also a societal tendency to allow individuals to be "fooled," as "everyone has the right to be fooled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This highlights a critical need for robust education and the development of [[strategies_to_combat_misinformation_and_protect_democracy | critical thinking]] skills to protect individuals and society from exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Why People Fall for Conmen

Several factors contribute to people falling victim to fraud:

*   **Illiteracy** Illiteracy can be a contributing factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. However, it's not the sole reason, as many educated individuals in good jobs are also conned by fraudsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Deficiencies in the Education System** The Indian [[effects_of_exam_fraud_on_students_and_education_system | education system]] is often criticized for not prioritizing the development of [[strategies_to_combat_misinformation_and_protect_democracy | critical thinking]] abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Children are often compelled to learn without questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This can result in individuals, even IIT graduates, holding beliefs that contradict basic scientific principles they learned in school, such as claiming that burning wood for worship purifies the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of Scientific Temperament** There is a noticeable lack of scientific temperament in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. This absence makes people susceptible to believing outlandish claims, such as food spoiling during an eclipse or water making one sick if looked at angrily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Even individuals who speak English, perceived by some as more credible, propagate unscientific ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Blind Faith** Faith, understood as a blind belief without the need for thought, questioning, or doubt, makes people want to believe in miraculous claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Emotional Vulnerability** Conmen often exploit the poor emotional states and problems faced by individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. In India, the culture of seeking professional help from therapists or psychologists for mental problems is not yet widespread, leaving people without conventional support channels and thus turning to conmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. This highlights the need for [[improving_mental_health_and_education_infrastructure | improving mental health]] infrastructure.

## Promoting Critical Thinking

To counter fraudulent activities, it is essential to cultivate critical thinking and scientific temperament:

*   **Understanding "Tricks"** Many alleged miracles performed by conmen are merely tricks, similar to those used by magicians or mentalists for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Famous magician James Randi, for example, used his tricks for entertainment and even established a $1 million paranormal challenge to promote scientific temperament, which no one has ever won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing Service from Fraud** The traditional concept of "Babas" or spiritual leaders, who study scriptures and offer selfless life guidance or counselling without charging fees, is a positive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. However, the current trend involves fraudsters who merely seek to fool people and run businesses, having no genuine life advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

Exposing these conmen is crucial to protect society from their harmful intentions and benefits both religion and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

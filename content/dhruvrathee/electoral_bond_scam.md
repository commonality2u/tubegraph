The [[Electoral Bonds and their political impact | Electoral Bond Scam]] is described as the biggest scam globally, a claim supported by the Finance Minister's husband, an economist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is not a single scam but a collection of various frauds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These include:
*   Theft of public funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Awarding government tenders to unworthy companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Allowing tax-evading companies to continue their practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Extortion of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Cases where companies played with citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Impact on Public Health: Substandard Medicines

The [[Electoral Bonds and their political impact | Electoral Bond Scam]] has been linked to the approval and continued operation of pharmaceutical companies manufacturing substandard medicines, leading to severe health consequences and even deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Zydus Cadila and Remdesivir Controversy

During the second wave of Covid-19 in India, patients in Uttar Pradesh's Chiranjeev Hospital exhibited strange symptoms like shivering, high fever, and plummeting blood oxygen levels after receiving the antiviral medication Remdesivir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Similar incidents occurred at Lifeline Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Investigations traced these reactions to the same batch (V100167) of Remdesivir, manufactured by Zydus Cadila in Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Doctors halted the use of this batch, and patients' conditions improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Similar issues were reported in other Uttar Pradesh hospitals and across states like Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Bihar, involving various batches of Cadila's Remdesivir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Bihar's regulators tested batch V100167 and found it contained bacterial endotoxins, compounds that can cause fever and septic shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Despite this, the Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA), responsible for the manufacturing unit, did not conduct any testing or recall the medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Zydus Cadila denied these allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Six months prior, in November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had advised against using Remdesivir, finding it ineffective against Covid-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. However, the Modi government approved its production increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The connection to the [[Electoral Bonds and their political impact | electoral bond scam]] emerged when data revealed that Zydus Cadila donated ₹180 million to BJP through [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The company also donated ₹30 million to Congress and ₹80 million to BJP's ally, Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### Other Pharmaceutical Companies and Substandard Drugs

*   **Glenmark Pharmaceuticals**: Received five notices for substandard medicines between 2022 and 2023, primarily from Maharashtra FDA, including a blood pressure regulating medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Glenmark bought [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bonds]] worth ₹97.5 million in November 2022, which were encashed by BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Torrent Pharma**: Its antiplatelet medicine Deplatt 150 failed a salicylic acid test and was declared substandard by Maharashtra FDA in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. In October 2019, the US FDA warned the company for repeated quality failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Despite this, Torrent Pharma bought [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bonds]] worth ₹775 million between May 2019 and January 2024, with the majority (₹610 million) going to BJP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The BJP government in Gujarat took no action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Cipla**: Faced four show-cause notices for substandard medicines, including cough syrup and two instances for its Remdesivir medicine, where the active ingredient was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Cipla bought [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bonds]] worth ₹392 million, with ₹370 million going to BJP and ₹22 million to Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The timing of bond purchases by Cipla aligns with political power shifts in Maharashtra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Hetero Group**: Received six notices from Maharashtra FDA for substandard drugs, three of which were for its Remdesivir medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Despite calls for licence cancellation, the company recalled medicines and bought [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bonds]] worth ₹1.2 billion for BRS (then in power in Telangana) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. The founder and chairman were given Rajya Sabha seats by BRS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. When BJP returned to power in Maharashtra in 2022, they encashed ₹150 million from this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Contaminated Cough Syrups and Child Deaths

In December 2022, 18 children in Uzbekistan died from substandard cough syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The WHO linked these deaths to Ambronol Syrup and Dok1-Max Syrup, both manufactured by Marion Biotech in Uttar Pradesh, India, and distributed by Quramax Medical in Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Laboratory analysis found high amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Similar deaths occurred in Gambia and Cameroon, involving Marion Biotech, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, and Riemann Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. In total, 141 children died, with Marion Biotech's syrup linked to 68 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Uzbekistan banned drugs imported by Quramax, cancelled its licence, and sentenced 23 people, including Quramax's Indian Executive Director, to imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. In India, investigations found 22 samples of Marion Biotech's cough syrup to be adulterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. The company bought industrial-grade propylene glycol, which is toxic for humans, from an unlicensed supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Marion Biotech's head of operations confessed they had never tested their propylene glycol for over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

Despite the gravity of the situation, Marion Biotech employees were released on bail, and the directors were protected from arrest unless convicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. In October 2023, the Uttar Pradesh government allowed Marion Biotech to reopen its factory, though not to manufacture products containing propylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

Another similar case involved Digital Vision Pharma Company, whose cough syrup caused the deaths of about 12 children in Udhampur, J&K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. This company also used industrial-grade ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Despite multiple warnings from drug regulators, it took three years to file a charge sheet, and no one has been found guilty four years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

In December 2023, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation found that 54 pharma companies failed export quality tests for cough syrups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Government Response to Low-Quality Drugs

Despite these serious incidents, the government passed the "Jan Vishwas Bill" in August 2023, which aims to ease penalties for low-quality drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. This bill decriminalizes minor offenses committed by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Critically, it amended Section 27D of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, allowing companies to resolve lab test failures through out-of-court compromises and payments instead of imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Public health activists have condemned this move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## Role of Supreme Court and Transparency

Prime Minister Modi stated that the [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bonds]] allowed transparency by enabling the tracking of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. However, the [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bond scheme]] was originally a secret political funding method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The details of who paid how much to whom only became public after the [[Role of Supreme Court in Electoral Bonds Case | Supreme Court]] declared the scheme unconstitutional and struck it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

Overall, pharmaceutical companies donated ₹9.45 billion to political parties through [[electoral_bonds_scheme_in_india | electoral bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

As India approached independence in 1946, the nation found itself in a "riveting political game of thrones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The question was not *if* India would be free, but *when* and *how* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The British decision to leave was influenced by several factors, including the 1942 Quit India Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's Indian National Army's struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, the Royal Navy mutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, and the economic strain on Britain after the Second World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. With Clement Attlee's Labour government promising India's freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, discussions shifted to the execution of the transfer of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Political Landscape and the Rise of Jinnah

In January 1946, the Indian subcontinent was divided into British India provinces and princely states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The Government of India Act 1935 had introduced elected legislators and Indian ministers, granting provinces significant autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. In the 1937 provincial elections, the Congress Party won in 7 out of 11 provinces, while the Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, faced losses, winning only 22% of reserved Muslim seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

However, by the 1946 provincial elections, the communal divide between Hindus and Muslims had become significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Politicians like Jinnah used provocative speeches, claiming that a united India would mean "the Muslim would be transferred from the domination of the British to the caste Hindu rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. As a result, the Muslim League won 87% of the reserved Muslim seats in the provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, and became the single largest party in Punjab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This gave Jinnah "a lot of political power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, forcing the British to negotiate with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Jinnah, who had once been a member of the Congress Party and advocated for Hindus and Muslims living together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, had transformed. He disagreed with Gandhi's civil disobedience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> and rejected his "pseudo-religious approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Upon his return to politics in the mid-1930s, Jinnah declared himself "the only spokesperson of Muslims in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> and began campaigning for a separate country, Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Cabinet Mission and the "Direct Action Day"

In March 1946, the British Cabinet Mission arrived in India to negotiate independence with the Congress and Muslim League leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Their plan, presented on May 16, 1946, proposed a "United India" divided into three groups of provinces based on Hindu and Muslim majorities, with a weak central government handling only defence, external affairs, and communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Jinnah accepted this plan due to the autonomy it offered Muslim-dominated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

However, the Congress initially rejected the plan, adamant about a proper united India and unwilling to work with Jinnah in a "skeleton government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. On July 10, 1946, then-Congress President Pandit Nehru held a press conference stating that Congress retained the right to change the Cabinet Mission Plan if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Jinnah perceived this as Nehru planning to impose his ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, immediately rejected the plan, and refused to work with Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

On July 29, 1946, Jinnah announced that the Muslim League was preparing for a struggle, stating that if Muslims weren't given Pakistan, they would initiate "Direct Action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The next day, August 16, 1946, was declared [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | Direct Action Day]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, with Jinnah declaring, "India would either be divided or destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

The epicentre of this call was Bengal, where the Muslim League held significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Under Chief Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, known as "the Butcher of Bengal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, "orthodox, unemployed, frustrated, brainwashed, and anti-social elements" were given free rein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The police were instructed to support the populist movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. By the time the violence ended, Calcutta had become "a city of corpses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, with an estimated 6,000 killed and 15,000 injured between August 16-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The [[communal_violence_and_false_flag_operations_in_india | Direct Action Day riots]] were just the beginning, as "our nation saw many more riots" before [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | partition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Interim Government and Escalating Violence

Despite the violence, Viceroy Wavell invited Nehru and Congress to form an interim government on August 6, 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. After initial hesitation and a failed meeting between Jinnah and Nehru, where Jinnah insisted on the Muslim League's sole right to nominate Muslim members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a> (which Congress, as a [[communalism_versus_secularism_in_indian_history | secular]] party, refused to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>), the interim government was formed on September 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

On October 15, 1946, Jinnah finally agreed to the Muslim League joining the interim government, but notably did not join himself, instead nominating Liaquat Ali Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While the formation of a balanced government seemed hopeful for a united India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, "things started to deteriorate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a> as "Hindu-Muslim riots showed no signs of stopping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

Within weeks, large-scale [[communal_violence_and_false_flag_operations_in_india | riots broke out in Noakhali]], Bengal, a Muslim-majority area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. On October 10, 1946, armed mobs looted, set fires, killed people, and carried out forced conversions, acknowledged by Chief Minister Suhrawardy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Mahatma Gandhi was deeply saddened and visited Noakhali, walking barefoot for months, promoting [[communalism_versus_secularism_in_indian_history | communal unity]] by bringing together Hindu and Muslim leaders in villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Gandhi believed that if people lived together peacefully, [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | partition]] would not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

Despite Gandhi's efforts, retaliatory riots began in Bihar on October 24, 1946, and similar situations emerged in the United Provinces, embodying Gandhi's fear that "hatred and this eye for an eye ideology was truly making our nation blind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Gandhi began to realize the strength of Jinnah's hold over a segment of Muslim society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## Mountbatten's Role and the Final Partition Plan

In March 1947, the Muslim League successfully overthrew the coalition government in Punjab, a province deemed crucial for Pakistan's formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Riots erupted in Rawalpindi and Lahore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Frustrated by the ongoing riots, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten as India's last Viceroy on March 22, 1947, tasking him with stopping the riots and negotiating with Jinnah and Nehru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

Mountbatten initially sought a united India, but Jinnah rejected his proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel, fed up with the Muslim League's constant interference in the interim government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, eventually accepted the idea of an independent Pakistan, believing it was the only way to avoid further national catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

Only Mahatma Gandhi remained steadfast against [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | partition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. On April 1, 1947, he desperately proposed to Mountbatten that Jinnah be made Prime Minister of a united India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, willing to have 300 million Hindus governed by Jinnah to keep the country united <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. However, Nehru and Sardar Patel, having witnessed Jinnah's conduct firsthand, refused to accept this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. Their refusal was a "painful and shocking moment for Gandhi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

With Congress now largely accepting [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | partition]], Mountbatten prepared the "Dickie Bird Plan," which initially allowed provinces to remain independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. Jinnah even approved of this "three-nation theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. However, Nehru vehemently opposed it, fearing India would disintegrate into "500 fragments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

Mountbatten then tasked VP Menon to prepare a new partition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. Menon proposed transferring power to two independent British Dominions: India and Pakistan, with provinces divided based on elected representatives, and Bengal and Punjab split into two parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. The plan also minimized the possibility of princely states remaining independent, advising them to choose either India or Pakistan based on geographical contiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

On June 3, 1947, this new plan was put forward and accepted by all major leaders, including Nehru, Patel, Jinnah, and Liaquat Ali Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. While no one was completely happy, compromises were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. On August 15, 1947, India gained its freedom at midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

The [[partition_of_india_and_role_of_jinnah | partition]] that followed resulted in approximately 15 million people migrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>, over 1 million killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>, forced religious conversions, and over 75,000 women kidnapped and raped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>, marking a tragic chapter in India's independence.

On December 3, 1971, Pakistan initiated **Operation Chengiz Khan**, a preemptive military strike. The Pakistani Air Force bombed several Indian airfields, including Amritsar, Pathankot, Jodhpur, Ambala, Agra, and Srinagar, totaling 11 airfields [00:00:00]. That evening, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi addressed the Indian citizens via radio, declaring that a war had been struck against India [00:00:17]. The Indian Air Force retaliated, marking the beginning of the 1971 India-Pakistan War [00:00:34]. This conflict ultimately led to the birth of a new nation, Bangladesh [00:00:41].

## Roots of Conflict

The origins of the war can be traced back to the pre-colonial era of the Indian subcontinent. Before the British Raj, the region, encompassing present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Burma (Myanmar), and Sri Lanka, consisted of thousands of autonomous kingdoms, each with distinct languages, traditions, and cultures [00:01:25]. The Bengal region, including modern-day Bangladesh and West Bengal, was primarily ruled by Muslim monarchs from the 13th century, beginning with Mohammad Bakhtiyar Khilji [00:01:44]. These rulers focused on integrating local communities, fostering a prevalent coexistence and intermingling between Islam and Hinduism, which largely controlled extremism [00:02:10].

In 1757, the [[conflict_between_british_east_india_company_and_mughal_empire | British East India Company]] took control of Bengal [00:02:36], leading to the [[british_expansion_and_control_in_india_leading_to_the_british_raj | British Rule]] until 1947 and the devastating partition of India and Pakistan [00:02:43].

### The Partition of 1947

The 1940 Lahore Resolution, drafted during the All India Muslim League's annual session, demanded a separate state for Muslims due to fears of being a minority in a unified India [00:03:02]. The partition, drawn on religious lines, disregarded existing social, commercial, and cultural relationships [00:03:17]. Large states with common cultures and languages, such as Punjab and Bengal, were divided, creating an artificial separation that did not alter the cultures or languages of the people [00:03:26].

Muslims in Bengal who favored Pakistan hoped for a better standard of living and improved financial and social conditions in a new Muslim country, expecting fundamental rights from the Pakistani government [00:03:56]. The partition resulted in large-scale migrations, with Muslims moving to Pakistan and Hindus to India, leading to widespread riots and mob violence that caused an estimated 200,000 to 2 million deaths [00:04:17]. A significant group of Muslims from Bihar migrated to East Pakistan [00:04:44], later labeled "Anti-Bangladeshi" for their perceived pro-Pakistan stance [00:05:00].

The Partition of Bengal was particularly contentious. Initially, a unified Bengal voted against being part of Pakistan [00:05:10]. However, West Bengal desired partition to join India, while East Bengal preferred not to be partitioned but would join Pakistan if it was inevitable [00:05:17]. Ultimately, West Bengal became part of India, and East Bengal became East Pakistan, separated by 1,500 km of Indian territory [00:05:33].

### Disparities in Pakistan

Despite Bengalis constituting the majority ethnic group (over half the population) in the newly formed Pakistan, powerful positions in bureaucracy, military, and politics were concentrated in West Pakistan, primarily among Mohajirs and Punjabis [00:05:45].

Pakistan began as a parliamentary democracy, but power became highly centralized, preventing a robust democratic system from being established [00:06:26]. Following the 1946 elections, Mohammad Ali Jinnah became Governor General of Pakistan (until his death in 1948) [00:06:41]. A series of leadership changes and political instability followed, including Pakistan's first military coup in 1953, when Ghulam Muhammad dismissed Prime Minister Nazimuddin [00:07:17].

In 1954, elections saw the United Front, a collation of opposition parties led by the Awami League (from East Bengal), win most seats [00:07:26]. However, Ghulam Muhammad dismissed the constituent assembly [00:07:40]. In 1955, East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan [00:07:55]. From 1947 to 1971, Pakistan experienced multiple phases of military rule, forcibly removing power from political parties and specifically denying political representation to East Pakistanis [00:08:00].

Economic disparity was stark: 75% of the national budget was spent on West Pakistan, even though East Pakistan generated 62% of the government's revenue [00:08:20]. By 1969-70, West Pakistan's per capita income was 61% higher than East Pakistan's [00:08:39]. West Pakistan also had 25 times more military personnel stationed there [00:08:46].

### Language Imposition and Bengali Identity

The imposition of Urdu as the sole state language was a major point of contention [00:08:53]. Mohammad Ali Jinnah declared in Dhaka in 1948 that Urdu would be the state language, despite 56% of Pakistanis speaking Bangla [00:09:33]. Urdu was considered the language of the elite, while common people in Bengal spoke Bangla [00:09:25].

This led to the Bengali Language Movement. A major protest on February 21, 1952, saw Pakistani army forces open fire on students and political activists, killing five people [00:10:00]. February 21 is now celebrated as Language Martyr's Day in Bangladesh and was declared International Mother Language Day by UNESCO in 1999 [00:10:16]. Bangla was eventually granted official status in 1954 and became a state language in 1956 [00:10:30]. These events strengthened Bengali cultural and linguistic identity [00:10:39].

## Escalation to the Liberation War

The 1965 India-Pakistan War further exposed East Pakistan's weak defense and exacerbated the economic and political imbalance between the two wings [00:10:48]. This led Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a leader of the Awami League, to propose a Six-Point Demand for East Pakistan's economic development [00:11:08]. These demands included turning Pakistan into a federation with greater autonomy for East Pakistan, separate currencies and foreign reserves, and even a separate military force, effectively seeking to make East Pakistan an independent country [00:11:20].

West Pakistan's government rejected these demands as separatist and arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 34 other Bengali civil and military officers on June 19, 1968, under sedition charges in the Agartala Conspiracy Case [00:11:49]. They were accused of collaborating with India in Agartala to create an independent Bangladesh [00:12:26].

Mujibur Rahman had become a popular voice for Bengalis suffering discrimination [00:12:42]. His arrest sparked widespread protests, intensifying after Sergeant Zahurul Haq, an imprisoned associate, was killed in jail [00:12:54]. Facing worsening unrest, General Ayub Khan, who had run a military dictatorship for 10 years, released Mujibur Rahman and withdrew the case on February 22, 1969 [00:13:13]. However, the protests and strikes led to Ayub Khan's resignation in 1969, and he appointed General Yahya Khan as his successor [00:13:33].

Yahya Khan promised and held the first general elections in Pakistan in 1970 [00:13:52]. The Awami League won 167 out of 313 seats, securing almost all seats in East Pakistan but none in West Pakistan [00:14:05]. In West Pakistan, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won 86 seats but none in East Pakistan [00:14:39]. These results highlighted the deep divide within Pakistan [00:14:48].

Since the Awami League, based in East Pakistan, won a majority, they were considered the election winners [00:14:56]. However, the political elite in West Pakistan, including PPP leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, resisted the idea of a government formed by a party that won no seats in West Pakistan [00:15:06]. General Yahya Khan, influenced by these discussions, canceled the election results on March 1, 1971 [00:15:31].

This cancellation sparked an uproar in East Pakistan, leading to large-scale protests demanding freedom [00:15:41]. People argued that if West Pakistan refused to accept their elected leaders, East Pakistan should have the autonomy to form its own country [00:16:01]. This marked the foundation of the Bangladeshi Liberation War [00:16:06]. At this point, Bengali ethnicity surpassed Islam as the unifying factor, driving the desire for a secular, democratic, socialist state named Bangladesh, meaning "the country of the Bengali people" [00:16:12].

On March 7, 1971, the Awami League initiated a Non-Cooperation Movement against West Pakistan's government [00:16:32]. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a historic speech, declaring, "People in Bengal want freedom. People in Bengal want to live. People in Bengal want their fundamental rights" [00:16:54]. The rallying cry became, "Victory to Bengal! This revolution is for our Freedom! This revolution is for our Independence!" [00:17:08].

Tensions between Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis, seen as pro-West Pakistan, escalated, with attacks on Bihari communities [00:17:22]. The Pakistani army used these incidents as a pretext to intervene in March 1971 [00:17:46]. They recruited some pro-Pakistan Bengalis, notably from the Jamat-e-Islami political party, who supported the West Pakistani government and collaborated with the army [00:17:51]. Between March 10 and 13, all Pakistan International Airlines flights were urgently rerouted to Dhaka, transporting Pakistani soldiers disguised as civilians for an operation [00:18:12].

Bengali nationalists formed their independent army, the Mukti Bahini (Force of Independence), which conducted guerrilla operations against the Pakistani army [00:18:38]. The [[indias_operation_sindoor_and_military_strategy | Indian Army]] provided training in guerrilla warfare to the Mukti Bahini [00:18:52]. In response, West Pakistan formed the East Pakistan Central Peace Committee, ironically named Shanti Bahini, which committed extensive war crimes, including killing thousands of civilians and brutalizing women [00:19:00]. Intellectuals like teachers, scholars, and social activists (known as Budhhijivi) were specifically targeted and murdered [00:19:14]. Law and order collapsed in East Pakistan, with Bengalis refusing to obey instructions from West Pakistan [00:19:23].

## Operation Searchlight and Bangladesh's Declaration of Independence

On March 25, 1971, the West Pakistani government launched Operation Searchlight, a genocidal plan to eliminate those advocating for Bangladesh's independence [00:19:34]. Thousands of Pakistani Army troops marched into Dhaka that night, arresting Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and transporting him to West Pakistan [00:19:51]. Before his arrest, Mujibur Rahman declared East Pakistan an independent country, proclaiming it as Bangladesh [00:19:59]. This declaration, transmitted via radio, led to March 26 being celebrated as Bangladesh's Independence Day [00:20:11]. On March 27, Major Ziaur Rahman publicly read this declaration, announcing Bangladesh's independence [00:20:24].

That same night, Pakistani Army forces attacked two student dormitories in Dhaka, murdering 7,000 students [00:20:34]. Within a week of Operation Searchlight, over 30,000 Bengalis were massacred [00:20:43]. Half of Dhaka's population fled, foreign journalists were deported, and radio operations were shut down [00:20:50].

Pakistani journalist Anthony Mascarenhas, who was military-appointed, fled to the United Kingdom and published an article in *The Sunday Times* on June 13, 1971, detailing the genocide he witnessed [00:21:00]. This article informed the world about the oppression in Bangladesh and motivated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to take action [00:21:12].

Many Awami League political leaders fled to India for safety [00:21:24]. On April 10, the People's Republic of Bangladesh government was formed in exile in Kolkata, with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared President and Tajuddin Ahmad as Prime Minister [00:21:29].

## India's Involvement in the War

The conflict severely impacted India, with over 10 million refugees crossing the border into India during the autumn of 1971 [00:21:42]. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi considered military intervention to save these people more economically feasible than supporting such a large refugee population [00:21:54]. On April 28, 1971, she directed General Sam Manekshaw to prepare for war and enter East Pakistan [00:22:10]. Although initially hesitant due to preparation time, Manekshaw was given autonomy by Gandhi to conduct the operation when he deemed fit [00:22:20]. His efforts began with training the Mukti Bahini [00:22:38]. By July 1971, Indira Gandhi ceased referring to the region as East Pakistan [00:22:42].

On December 3, 1971, Pakistan launched **Operation Chengiz Khan**, attacking Indian airfields [00:22:56]. Pakistan's intention was to preempt India's military interference in the war [00:23:06]. However, this strategy failed due to India's superior military strategy and power [00:23:16]. India adopted a defensive strategy in West Pakistan and a coordinated offensive thrust, deploying ground troops into East Pakistan [00:23:26].

### International Reactions

With India's entry, Pakistan appealed to the United Nations for a ceasefire [00:23:36]. The UN Security Council convened on December 4 [00:23:45]. The USA favored Pakistan, while the Soviet Union favored India [00:23:50]. The US, China, and the UK supported an immediate ceasefire and recall of Indian troops, but the Soviet Union twice vetoed this resolution, considering the atrocities committed against Bengalis [00:23:55]. The UK and France later abstained from voting [00:24:10].

On December 6, 1971, Bhutan became the first country to officially recognize Bangladesh, followed by India on the same day [00:24:15].

By December 12, Pakistan was facing defeat in the Indo-Pak War [00:24:25]. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, flew to New York to discuss a ceasefire with America [00:24:33]. However, before a proposal could be finalized, Pakistan's military in East Pakistan had already surrendered [00:24:44].

## End of the War and Birth of Bangladesh

On December 16, 1971, the Indian Army surrounded Dhaka, giving the Pakistani Army 30 minutes to surrender [00:25:15]. Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi surrendered without resistance, and the government of East Pakistan collapsed [00:25:25]. The historic Instrument of Surrender was signed, marking the end of the war [00:25:36]. Over 93,000 Pakistani troops surrendered to the Indian and Bangladesh Liberation forces, making it the largest surrender since World War II [00:25:42].

In 1972, the Simla Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan [00:25:52]. Under this agreement, Pakistan recognized Bangladesh as an independent country [00:25:57]. In return, India released the 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war over the next five months and returned 13,000 km² of land occupied by Indian troops in West Pakistan [00:26:07].

Bangladesh was recognized by the United Nations as an independent country in 1974 [00:26:35].

## Aftermath in Pakistan and Bangladesh

In Pakistan, Yahya Khan's dictatorship collapsed, and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was sworn in as the new President on December 20, 1971 [00:26:40]. As per the Simla Agreement, Mujibur Rahman was released from prison and returned to Dhaka as a hero [00:26:51]. In the 1973 Bangladeshi elections, his Awami League won with a landslide majority [00:26:57].

However, Bangladesh also faced political instability similar to Pakistan's history of military dictatorships [00:27:11]. Mujibur Rahman, a secular leader, banned political parties formed on religious grounds, including Jamat-e-Islami [00:27:22]. On August 15, 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were assassinated [00:27:33]. General Ziaur Rahman seized power in a military coup in 1975, portraying the military as heroes and revoking the ban on Jamat-e-Islami [00:27:50]. Bangladesh remained a military dictatorship for several years instead of a secular democracy [00:28:06]. In 2009, Mujibur Rahman's daughter, Sheikh Hasina, came to power, and the Awami League remains the ruling party [00:28:13].

The events leading to Bangladesh's independence highlight the profound impact of language imposition and unequal treatment within a nation [00:28:38].

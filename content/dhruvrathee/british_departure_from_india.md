A year before India's independence, the nation witnessed a complex "political game of thrones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The question in 1946 was not if India would be free, but when and how <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Reasons for British Withdrawal

Several factors contributed to the British decision to leave India:
*   **Quit India Movement (1942)**: Millions of Indians, led by Gandhi, raised their voices against the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Indian National Army (INA) and Red Fort Trials (1944-1945)**: Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's struggle and the subsequent trials shocked the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Royal Navy Mutiny (1946)**: Indian soldiers of the British Navy revolted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Second World War**: The war left Britain with heavy unemployment, an unending economic recession, and uncertain industries and treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Labour Party's Promise**: After the 1945 elections, new UK Prime Minister Clement Attlee's party had promised to return India's freedom in their manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Public Opinion**: The majority of the British people were in favor of freeing India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Political Landscape in 1946

In January 1946, the Indian subcontinent consisted of British India provinces (yellow) and princely states (pink) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. There were 17 provinces, 11 of which had already held elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Government of India Act 1935
The [[british_expansion_and_control_in_india_leading_to_the_british_raj | British government]] passed the Government of India Act 1935, granting provinces significant autonomy and introducing elected legislators and Indian ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. However, crucial powers like defense, foreign relations, and veto rights remained with the British Governor-General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Provincial Elections
*   **1937 Elections**: The first provincial elections were held in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Major parties included Congress, [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]], and Sikandar Hayat Khan's Unionist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Around 30 million Indians voted, though voting rights were restricted to property owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Congress won in 7 out of 11 provinces, while the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] faced losses, winning only 22% of reserved Muslim seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **1946 Elections**: Held nine years later due to World War II and the Quit India Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. By this time, the communal divide had grown significantly, partly due to politicians like Jinnah inciting fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] won Bengal and Sindh and secured 87% of all reserved Muslim seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Congress won the remaining 9 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Rise of Muhammad Ali Jinnah

After 1946, [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] gained significant political power, forcing the British to negotiate with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. While Congress leaders wanted a united India, Jinnah sought to divide the nation to create a separate country, Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Jinnah's political journey saw a transformation:
*   **Early Years**: He was a member of the Congress Party 26 years prior and advocated for Hindus and Muslims living together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. In 1915, he welcomed Mahatma Gandhi back to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Jinnah's family had Hindu origins, converting to Islam due to social excommunication related to their fishing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Disagreement with Gandhi**: By 1920, disagreements arose between Jinnah and Congress, particularly concerning Gandhi's civil disobedience methods and the non-cooperation resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Jinnah opposed Gandhi's Khilafat movement, viewing himself as secular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Return to Politics**: Feeling neglected by Congress, Jinnah gave up politics in the late 1920s, returning in the mid-1930s as a "completely different person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. He declared himself the "sole spokesperson of Muslims in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> and began campaigning for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Cabinet Mission Plan (1946)

On March 24, 1946, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee sent the Cabinet Mission to India to negotiate independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Their objectives included:
1.  **Re-establishing the Viceroy's Executive Council**: Viceroy Wavell proposed that all members except the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief should be Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Jinnah demanded that only the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] appoint Muslim members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
2.  **Drafting a new Constitution**: A Constituent Assembly of India was formed for this purpose, later led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
3.  **Framework for Post-British India**: This was the most crucial objective, outlining India's geographical and political structure after the British withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

On May 16, 1946, the Cabinet Mission presented its plan:
*   **United India**: India was to remain united with one central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Limited Central Power**: The central government would handle only defense, external affairs, and communications, with other powers distributed among groups of provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Provincial Grouping**: India would be divided into three groups of provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>:
    *   Section A: Hindu majority areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
    *   Section B: Muslim majority areas in the North-West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
    *   Section C: Muslim majority areas in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Jinnah's Acceptance**: Jinnah accepted this plan as it granted significant autonomy to Muslim-dominated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Congress's Initial Rejection**: Congress initially rejected the plan, as they wanted a proper United India with a strong central government and did not wish to work with Jinnah in a "skeleton government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Nehru's Statement and Direct Action Day

On July 10, 1946, Congress President Pandit Nehru held a press conference stating that while Congress agreed to the Constituent Assembly, they retained the right to change the Cabinet Mission Plan if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

This statement proved to be a "huge mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Jinnah perceived it as Nehru planning to impose his ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Jinnah immediately rejected the Cabinet Mission Plan and refused to work with Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

On July 29, 1946, Jinnah announced that the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] would initiate a struggle, threatening "Direct Action" if Muslims were not granted a separate nation, Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Great Calcutta Killings (Direct Action Day)
August 16, 1946, was declared "Direct Action Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Jinnah warned that "India would either be divided or destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Bengal, where the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] held significant political power, became the epicenter of the violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Chief Minister of Bengal (known as the "Butcher of Bengal" by Viceroy Wavell), allowed "orthodox, unemployed, frustrated, brainwashed, and anti-social elements" to cause havoc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Police were instructed to support the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. The violence resulted in Calcutta becoming "a city of corpses," with approximately 6,000 killed and 15,000 injured between August 16 and 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. These riots were "just the beginning" of further unrest before [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | partition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Formation of the Interim Government

Despite the violence, Viceroy Wavell invited Nehru and Congress to form an interim government on August 6, 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Negotiations**: Wavell attempted to bridge the divide between Congress and the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] before the Direct Action Day violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Nehru-Jinnah Meeting**: On August 15, 1946, Jinnah and Nehru met, agreeing that communal problems could be solved through mutual discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Nehru offered concessions, including five ministries to the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] in the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Sticking Point**: Jinnah's condition that only the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] could nominate Muslim candidates was unacceptable to secular Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Interim Government Announcement**: On August 25, 1946, the formation of an interim government was declared, with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and others appointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Two Muslim members were to be appointed later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Muslim League Joins**: Seeing the government formed on Congress's terms, Jinnah agreed for the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] to join the interim government without conditions on October 15, 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Jinnah nominated Liaquat Ali Khan (who later became Pakistan's first Prime Minister) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] was eventually given five ministries, including Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Deterioration of Relations and Continued Riots

Despite the formation of the interim government, cooperation between Congress and the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] became increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

### Noakhali Riots (October 1946)
Weeks after the interim government's formation, large-scale riots erupted in Noakhali, Bengal, a Muslim-majority area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Tensions between Muslim farmers and Hindu moneylenders had worsened since the Great Depression of 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. On October 10, 1946, armed mobs looted, set fires, killed people, and carried out forced conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Chief Minister Suhrawardy acknowledged the conversions but took no action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

### Gandhi's Efforts for Unity
Mahatma Gandhi was deeply saddened by these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. From November 6, 1946, to February 1947, he walked barefoot through 47 villages in Noakhali, covering 180 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. He sought to promote communal unity by finding Hindu and Muslim leaders in each village and convincing them to live together as guarantors of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Gandhi believed that if people lived in peace, it would be reflected in politicians, preventing [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | partition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

While Gandhi worked to heal wounds, Nehru believed he was treating symptoms rather than addressing the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Despite Gandhi's efforts, violence spread to Bihar and the United Provinces, as revenge for Noakhali incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Gandhi began to realize the extent of Jinnah's influence over a segment of Muslim society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

### Punjab Government Overthrown
In March 1947, the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] overthrew the coalition government in Punjab, a crucial province for Pakistan's formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Riots erupted in Rawalpindi, forcing Chief Minister Khizr Hayat Tiwana to resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Although the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] couldn't form a government, new riots broke out in Lahore after Akali Dal leader Master Tara Singh chanted "Down with Pakistan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

## Mountbatten's Arrival and Congress's Shift

Frustrated by the riots, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten as India's last Viceroy on March 22, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Mountbatten was tasked with ending the riots, convincing Jinnah and Nehru, and resolving the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

Mountbatten initially sought a united India, but Jinnah rejected his proposals for unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Meanwhile, Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel, tired of the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]]'s constant interference in the interim government, reluctantly accepted the idea of an independent Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. They believed continued work under existing circumstances would be disastrous for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

## Gandhi's Last Stand Against Partition

Mahatma Gandhi remained steadfastly against [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | partition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. On April 1, 1947, he met Mountbatten, pleading with him not to divide India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. In a desperate attempt to keep India united, Gandhi proposed making Jinnah the Prime Minister of a united India, even if it meant 300 million Hindus being governed by him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

Mountbatten agreed to this proposal if Gandhi could convince Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. However, Nehru and Sardar Patel, having experienced working with the [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | Muslim League]] in the interim government, refused Gandhi's request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. This refusal was a painful and shocking moment for Gandhi, as his word had always been obeyed by Nehru and Patel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

## Mountbatten's Plans and Partition

With Congress finally agreeing to [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | partition]], Mountbatten prepared a new plan, the "Dickie Bird Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   **Dickie Bird Plan (Three-Nation Theory)**: This plan, passed in the British Cabinet on May 2, 1947, allowed every province to join India or Pakistan, or remain independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. It was initially intended for Bengal, but Mountbatten was convinced that Hindu Congress leaders in Bengal also wanted an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Jinnah approved this "three-nation theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Nehru's Rejection**: Pandit Nehru strongly opposed this plan, arguing it would disintegrate India into 500 fragments, leading to "Balkanisation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
*   **VP Menon's Plan (3rd June Plan)**: Shocked by Nehru's fury, Mountbatten tasked political commissioner VP Menon with preparing a new partition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. Menon proposed transferring power to two independent British Dominions, India and Pakistan, with provinces divided based on elected representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. Bengal and Punjab would be divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.
*   **Princely States**: Mountbatten minimized the possibility of princely states remaining independent, advising them to choose India or Pakistan based on geographical contiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. While some autonomy was symbolically retained, sensitive issues like defense and foreign affairs would depend on the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

## Final Acceptance and Aftermath

On June 3, 1947, the new plan was presented and accepted by all key leaders: Pandit Nehru, Sardar Patel, JB Kripalani, Baldev Singh, Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan, and Abdur Rab Nishtar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. While no one was entirely happy, compromises were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

At midnight on August 15, 1947, Pandit Nehru hoisted the Indian flag, marking India's freedom, albeit with a dominion status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Complete freedom as an independent republic came in 1950 with the implementation of the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

The [[Partition of India and role of Jinnah | partition]] led to devastating consequences:
*   Approximately 15 million people migrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   More than 1 million people were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   Forced religious conversions occurred overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   Over 75,000 women were kidnapped and raped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   Sardar Patel subsequently worked to unite all the princely states into India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

## Sources and Further Viewing

The events of this period are captured in great detail in the book "Freedom at Midnight" by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins, written in 1975 based on extensive research and interviews, including with Mountbatten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. This book has been adapted into a web series, "Freedom at Midnight," directed by Nikhil Advani, which is highly recommended for its depiction of facts and unknown details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

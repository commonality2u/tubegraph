The [[atomic_bombings_of_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | atomic bombings]] of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 marked a pivotal moment in World War II, leading to Japan's surrender and significantly impacting the nation and the world. These events illustrate the devastating power of nuclear weapons and the complex moral dilemmas surrounding their use.

## The Bombings: A Day of Devastation

On August 6, 1945, a typical Monday morning in Japan's Hiroshima city, an American Boeing B-29 aircraft was spotted in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. At 8:15 AM, an object fell from the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This object, which people could not identify from a distance, was an atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It free-fell for 43 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Hiroshima: "Little Boy"

Upon detonation, thousands witnessed a blinding light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, followed by an instant fireball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> that reached temperatures of 4,000°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. In a blink of an eye, 80,000 people were killed instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The bomb was ironically named "Little Boy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

Survivors described the initial blinding light that temporarily blinded people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, followed by a blast so loud it caused permanent hearing loss for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The 4,000°C ground temperature instantly vaporized people, leaving only their shadows permanently stuck to rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Shockwaves and strong winds akin to a hurricane followed, carrying debris and glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. Minutes later, the sky, once blue, was covered in black toxic fumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Seventy percent of Hiroshima's buildings were wiped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Half an hour after the blast, black, greasy, poisonous rain fell due to toxic dust mixing with moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Ninety percent of healthcare workers were killed, and hospitals destroyed, leaving survivors without aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Many who survived the initial blast died days, weeks, or months later from radiation sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Nagasaki: "Fat Man"

Despite the devastation in Hiroshima, the Japanese military fanatics refused to even hold a meeting, deeming it insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, and Emperor Hirohito still refused to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Consequently, three days later, on August 9, 1945, America dropped another atomic bomb on Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. This bomb, named "Fat Man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, was even more powerful and created a larger mushroom cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. It immediately killed 40,000 people and destroyed a 6.7 km² radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

Casualties in Nagasaki were fewer than Hiroshima for several reasons:
*   People were warned with pamphlets after the Hiroshima bombing, leading to evacuations from the city center to the outskirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   The hills surrounding Nagasaki lessened the impact of the explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

In total, these two bombings killed 200,000 people, 95% of whom were civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## Japan's Road to War and Refusal to Surrender

The [[reasons_for_japans_involvement_in_world_war_ii | reasons for Japan's involvement in World War II]] stem from early 20th-century imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Japan aimed to build a "Greater Asia" by annexing territories to exploit resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, similar to European colonizers. Their first major expansion was capturing the Manchuria region in Northern China in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, and later French Indo-China (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia) in 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

America initially tried to stay out of the war following the devastating results of WWI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, opting for economic actions like stopping exports of essential materials (Copper, Iron, Steel) and oil to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Eighty percent of Japan's oil was imported from America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. America demanded Japan withdraw from Chinese areas and break alliances with Germany and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Japan, however, decided to capture oil-rich Malaysia and Indonesia, which were British and Dutch territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, and the American territory of the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

To deter American intervention, Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Over 350 Japanese aircraft bombed the harbor, destroying 19 US Navy Ships, 188 military aircraft, and killing over 2,000 US military personnel within two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Japan then captured the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This reckless attack forced the US to officially declare war on Japan, leading to full involvement in WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Despite the surrender of Italy in 1943 and Germany in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, Japan, under Emperor Hirohito, refused to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This was largely due to widespread brainwashing, where common people believed Emperor Hirohito was a god and that dying for him was the greatest honor, while surrendering was humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This led to practices like Kamikaze pilots crashing into enemy warships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a> and children being trained to carry explosives to destroy tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Anti-war sentiments among the starving, unemployed Japanese populace were high, but they could not oppose the military or Emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

The Battle of Okinawa (April-June 1945) shocked America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Japanese forces, including civilians, fought to the last breath, demonstrating their unwillingness to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This bloodiest battle in the Pacific resulted in 12,000 American soldiers killed and over 50,000 injured, while 110,000 Japanese soldiers and over 100,000 Okinawan civilians (25% of the island's population) were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. American military leaders realized that a full-scale invasion (Operation Downfall) would result in immense casualties, potentially over a million American soldiers over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

## The Decision to Use Nuclear Weapons

Upon President Franklin D. Roosevelt's death in April 1945, Vice President Harry Truman became President and faced the responsibility of ending the war with Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He learned of the top-secret Manhattan Project, which was developing the first atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. After a successful test on July 16, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, Truman believed he had found a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Before deployment, the US, China, and Great Britain issued the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945, demanding Japan's unconditional surrender and warning of "prompt and utter destruction" if they refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Japan rejected this declaration on July 29, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. On August 3, President Truman authorized the atomic bombings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The [[us_perspective_and_decision_behind_using_nuclear_weapons | US perspective and decision behind using nuclear weapons]] was that they had no other option to force surrender without incurring massive casualties from a ground invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

## Japan's Surrender and Aftermath

After the Nagasaki bombing, the Japanese Supreme Council finally met to discuss surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. The vote for surrender was tied 3:3, with Emperor Hirohito acting as the tie-breaker, ultimately agreeing to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

The atomic bombs were not the sole reason for Japan's surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Hours before the Nagasaki bombing, the [[impact_of_the_soviet_union_in_wwii | Soviet Union had declared war on Japan]] and invaded the Japanese-occupied Manchuria region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. The combined threat of US bombings and Soviet invasion, along with growing civilian unrest in occupied territories, influenced the Emperor's decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

Some Japanese military personnel attempted an unsuccessful coup against the Emperor to prevent the surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. On August 15, 1945, after Japan's surrender, World War II officially ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

### Post-War Japan

The Allies occupied Japan until 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. During this period, a new constitution was adopted, democracy was established, and the Japanese Emperor remained as a figurehead without political powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

The total cost of destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was $970 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Reconstruction began almost immediately with volunteers from other cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Today, if one visits these cities, it is hard to imagine they were once targets of nuclear bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

Survivors of the bombings suffered long-term effects such as disabilities and increased chances of cancer due to radiation sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. However, the long-term radiation levels were not as harmful as those in Chernobyl due to the different nature of nuclear bombs versus nuclear power plants, and a later typhoon also helped reduce radiation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. For more information on radiation sickness, see the [[impact_of_the_chernobyl_disaster | Impact of the Chernobyl disaster]].

### Moral Debate

The decision to drop the atomic bombs remains a highly debated topic. US President Harry Truman never apologized for the bombings, believing they were a necessity to win the war and save potentially millions of American lives in a prolonged ground invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. At the time, the full long-lasting effects of radiation on human bodies were not known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

Critics argue that:
*   Bombing cities with 95% civilians was unnecessary; military facilities could have been targeted instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   The second bomb on Nagasaki was pointless, as Japan was already facing invasion from the Soviet Union and would have surrendered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
*   The invasion by the Soviet Union, rather than the atomic bombs, was the primary reason for Japan's surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   There is a moral dilemma in choosing to kill 200,000 people to save a potential 1 million soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

A 1991 survey showed 63% of Americans believed the bombings were justified, while only 29% of Japanese people shared this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. Nevertheless, these events served as a stark lesson on the devastating [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | impact of nuclear weapons]], leading to a global effort to prevent their further use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. The [[impact_on_usa_and_global_security_measures | impact on USA and Global Security Measures]] following this conflict was significant.

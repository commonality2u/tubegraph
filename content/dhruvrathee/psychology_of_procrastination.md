Procrastination is a common human experience where individuals set aims but fail to act on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often manifests as an "inherent feeling" that allows tasks to be put off until "tomorrow," leading to wasted time today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The phenomenon is the subject of scientific inquiry to understand its psychological underpinnings and find effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Historical and Contemporary Prevalence

Dr. Piers Steel, a leading researcher in the [[scientific_approaches_to_motivation | science of motivation]] and procrastination, has studied this topic for over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. He posits that procrastination is not a modern problem but has existed for ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Historical evidence includes:
*   Egyptian hieroglyphs from 1400 BC, translated by a University of Toronto Egyptologist, advise against putting off work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   An ancient Greek poet in 800 BC made similar remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   In India, Sant Kabir centuries ago famously stated, "Work today instead of putting it off for tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Despite these historical warnings, Dr. Steel notes a significant increase in chronic procrastination, with a 300% to 400% growth in the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Today, approximately half the world's population frequently procrastinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Studies on college students, such as those by Ellis and Knaus (1977) and O'Brien (2002), found that 80% to 90% of students procrastinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Why We Procrastinate

People typically procrastinate on tasks that are perceived as important, difficult, or require significant physical, mental, or emotional effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These demanding tasks are often replaced by easier, more interesting activities like browsing social media or watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Deadlines play a crucial role; people often procrastinate until the very last moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This procrastination often involves a cycle of delays, where short breaks extend into hours, leading to rushed, last-minute completion of tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Without deadlines, procrastination can continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Consequences of Procrastination

Procrastination can lead to significant [[life_priorities_and_regrets | regrets]] later in life, particularly when dreams or important goals are never pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Elders often attribute their unfulfilled aspirations to circumstances, but inwardly, they recognize a lack of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Health is another critical area impacted by procrastination. Delaying exercise or healthy eating can lead to serious health issues like diabetes or heart conditions, sometimes with fatal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

Emotionally, procrastinating on connecting with loved ones can result in heavy regret and disappointment, especially after their passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Procrastination has a direct [[impact_of_procrastination_on_mental_health | impact on mental health]]. A large gap between what one intends to do and what one actually does creates mental conflict, known as Cognitive Dissonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. A German university study of over 1,000 people found that procrastination is linked to high levels of stress, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## [[theories_explaining_motivation_and_procrastination | Theories Explaining Motivation and Procrastination]]

Scientists have proposed several [[theories_explaining_motivation_and_procrastination | theories]] to explain why people procrastinate, despite negative consequences:

### 1. Expectancy Theory
Coined by Victor Harold Vroom in 1964, this theory states that a person's motivation to perform a task depends on their expectation of achieving a desired result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. If the perceived chances of success are low, motivation will also be low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### 2. Need Theory
Developed in the 1960s by psychologist David McClelland, this theory identifies three primary needs:
*   **Need for Achievement:** Desire to excel and succeed.
*   **Need for Power:** Desire to influence or control others.
*   **Need for Affiliation:** Desire for social relationships and belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
Motivation for a task is higher if it aligns with an individual's dominant psychological need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### 3. Cumulative Prospect Theory
Introduced in 1992 by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, this theory highlights two main points:
*   **Loss Aversion:** The psychological impact of a loss is generally greater than that of an equivalent gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. People are more motivated to avoid a loss (e.g., losing a job) than to achieve an equivalent gain (e.g., a promotion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Relativity of Gains and Losses:** The perception of gains and losses is relative to an individual's reference point. What constitutes a significant gain or loss varies from person to person, influencing motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### 4. Hyperbolic Discounting Theory
This theory suggests that individuals are more motivated by immediate rewards than by rewards that are delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. While long-term thinking is beneficial, the pull of instant gratification often outweighs the motivation for future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

### Temporal Motivation Theory
In 2006, Dr. Piers Steel and Dr. Cornelius J. KÃ¶nig combined these four theories into a meta-theory called the Temporal Motivation Theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This theory proposes that motivation for a task arises when:
*   A personal need aligns with the work and its reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   There's an expectation of successfully completing the task and achieving the reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   The reward is perceived as significant and meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   The reward can be obtained relatively soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
When all these factors combine, procrastination is less likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Fear of Failure
Psychologists Tim Pychyl and J. R. Ferrari critiqued the Temporal Motivation Theory in 2012, arguing that it doesn't fully account for the guilt experienced when procrastinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. They proposed that a significant factor contributing to procrastination is the **fear of failure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Individuals may avoid tasks due to the anxiety of failing, choosing instead to engage in easier activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_overcome_procrastination | Strategies to Overcome Procrastination]]

The key to overcoming procrastination lies in identifying its underlying cause, which can stem from low expectations, misaligned needs, or the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

To find a solution, it's recommended to:
1.  **Identify the specific cause:** Reflect on why you are procrastinating and write it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
2.  **Apply relevant strategies:**
    *   **If due to perceived insignificance or lack of motivation:** Recall the principle of loss aversion. Remind yourself of the negative consequences of not completing the task (e.g., being fired from a job) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
    *   **If due to low expectation of success:** Focus on tasks where you are confident in your abilities or those you genuinely enjoy and can achieve good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
    *   **If the reward is far off:** Break down the task into smaller steps and reward yourself after completing each step to provide instant gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
    *   **If due to fear of failure:** Remember that "not trying is worse than failing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The fear of what others might say due to ego can lead to significant [[life_priorities_and_regrets | regret]] later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. According to Gilovich and Medvec's Temporal Theory of Regret (1995), actions may cause short-term regret, but inaction generates more regret in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
3.  **Minimize distractions:** While underlying psychological factors are primary, distractions like social media can still impede progress. Addressing these distractions is important once the deeper causes of procrastination are understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

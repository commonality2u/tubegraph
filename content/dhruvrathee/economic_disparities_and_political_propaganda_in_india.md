Political discourse in India often involves claims of humble origins and the projection of leaders as saviors, while economic disparities persist and are sometimes masked or manipulated. This article explores how political figures use narratives of poverty and personal sacrifice, alongside controlling public perception through various means, even as significant economic inequalities and challenges remain.

## The Narrative of Humble Beginnings and Economic Disparities

Leaders in India sometimes portray themselves as coming from extremely poor backgrounds to connect with the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. For instance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated he came from a very poor family and sold tea in trains during his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. However, this claim has been questioned due to childhood photos showing him in suits and his family's home not appearing to be of an "extremely poor" family from the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. His younger brother, Prahlad Modi, clarified that all brothers helped their father, who sold tea, suggesting Narendra Modi should be called a "tea seller's son" rather than a "tea seller" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Reports also suggest his father ran a canteen, not just a tea stall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Writer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay stated that Modi's poverty claims are "grossly exaggerated" and that his father had enough money to send his children to school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Such stories are exaggerated to sell an idea to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, creating an inspirational narrative of a leader who rose from the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

Despite these narratives, many common people face significant hardships. Mangal Vajpayee, a loader and BJP volunteer in Kanpur, struggles with lack of electricity, toilets, and sewer connections at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Despite complaining to BJP MLA Mahesh Trivedi multiple times, his issues remain unresolved, yet he expresses no complaints and calls himself a devotee of BJP, believing Prime Minister Modi to be God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This highlights a significant disconnect between supporters' fervent belief and their personal economic realities.

### Wealth Concentration and Poverty
During Narendra Modi's rule, certain wealthy individuals and companies, like Gautam Adani, have seen their wealth increase "beyond imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the situation of 800 million poor people in the nation who are dependent on 5 kg of free grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>, and face rising unemployment and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. The [[economic_disparity_and_poverty_in_maharashtra | income inequality]] in India has reached its highest in 100 years, surpassing levels seen during British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has accused the government of prioritizing oligarchs like Ambani and Adani over the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. He has proposed schemes like "Mahalaxmi Yojna" and "Pehli Naukri Pukki Yojna" to provide financial assistance and employment to millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. In response, PM Modi has taunted Rahul Gandhi, extended free ration schemes, and has not offered specific plans for employment or inflation control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

## Political Propaganda and Cult of Personality

Political parties employ various strategies for [[propaganda_and_misinformation_regarding_bjp | propaganda and misinformation regarding BJP]], often leading to a [[influence_on_indian_media_and_political_environment | cult of personality]] around leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This involves emotional manipulation and brainwashing on a large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

Key departments involved in this brainwashing include:
1.  **Instilling pride:** Filling people with pride, especially religious pride (e.g., "You are great because you are a Hindu") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Narrative of victimisation:** Claiming ancestors were victims for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
3.  **Spreading fear:** Suggesting that people are in danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
4.  **Presenting a messiah:** Portraying Narendra Modi as the sole savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Obscuring Poverty
To maintain appearances, poverty has been hidden or obscured. For example, a 1,600-foot-long wall was built in Gujarat to hide poor people during the "Namaste Trump" event in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. Similarly, slums were hidden behind green screens and poor people's movement restricted during the G20 summit in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

### Fabrication of Personal Sacrifice
A significant part of the cult of personality is the narrative that Narendra Modi "left his family for the nation" and "abandoned his wife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. This is presented as an achievement, despite the fact that many great leaders like Lal Bahadur Shastri and Mahatma Jyotirao Phule (with Savitribai Phule) were family men and contributed significantly to the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. The narrative is criticized as having an "anti-woman mentality" that views women as hindrances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

In contrast to the claim of abandoning family, Modi attends weddings of Bollywood celebrities and oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. His brother, Prahlad Modi, stated that family members are instructed to stay away from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>, and his niece, Sonal Modi, confirmed they were not invited to his oath ceremony as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>. This is seen as hypocritical given the G20 theme of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" (One Earth, One Family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

### The "Holy Beggar" Image
Narendra Modi has also claimed to be a "faqir" (holy beggar) who will leave with only the bare minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>. This image is contrasted with his opulent lifestyle, including wearing sunglasses worth ₹140,000 and traveling in a ₹120 million Mercedes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. He reportedly afforded foreign tours in the 1990s while allegedly living on charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. He also claimed to have used a digital camera in 1987-1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>, even though the first commercially available digital camera was released in the US in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>. His frequent outfit changes during public appearances also contradict the image of simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.

### Portrayal as a Deity or Superhero
Politicians and supporters frequently compare PM Modi to God or a divine incarnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. Temples have even been built in his honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>. This phenomenon is compared to historical instances where leaders like Adolf H were compared to religious figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.

In India, this involves changing the character of Hindu deities to align with a leader's image. For instance, the iconography of Lord Ram and Hanuman has been altered to depict them as "angry," a departure from traditional representations of gentleness and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>. False quotes like "Violence is the foremost duty" have been inserted into Hindu scriptures and circulated through platforms like WhatsApp to justify a [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | hate-filled agenda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. This deliberate contortion of religion is seen as a means to push a political agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.

### Control over Public Perception
To elevate the leader, opponents are often portrayed as incompetent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>. Rahul Gandhi, for example, is frequently depicted as an "incompetent Pappu" through out-of-context and edited clips circulated by IT cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. This stands in contrast to Rahul Gandhi's participation in unscripted interviews and lectures at universities like Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

The presence of the leader's face is ubiquitous, appearing in newspapers, radio, TV, social media, petrol pump hoardings, and government scheme advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:00">[24:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>. This includes being featured on COVID vaccine certificates and at selfie points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>. The government spent over ₹64.91 billion on advertisements in eight years, with ₹7.1 million daily for print ads alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:12:00">[25:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:00">[25:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>. This constant visibility, coupled with pro-government media narratives, aims to control public perception, reflecting the idea that "whoever controls the media, controls people's minds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.

However, public sentiment shows signs of weariness. Questions are being raised about why the government can claim to stop foreign wars but cannot stop violence in Manipur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>. Record numbers of Indian citizens are renouncing their citizenship (225,000 in 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:04:00">[26:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>. The need for BJP to recruit politicians accused of corruption from other parties to win elections suggests a waning of "Modi magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:00">[26:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>. These factors indicate growing [[challenges_to_indian_democracy_and_opposition | challenges to Indian democracy and opposition]].

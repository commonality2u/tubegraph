The Mahakumbh is considered the largest human gathering in the world, with over 500 million citizens reportedly visiting and taking a dip in the holy water of the Ganga River, demonstrating their faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The river Ganga is highly revered in Hinduism, with numerous pilgrimage sites like Gangotri, Rishikesh, Haridwar, Banaras, and Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad) located on its banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Prayagraj is specifically the confluence point of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, where the Mahakumbh Mela was organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Despite its sacred status, concerns have been raised regarding the significant pollution of the Ganga River, particularly during the Mahakumbh, and alleged government attempts to conceal this truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Official government data suggests the river water at the Sangam is not safe for bathing, let alone drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Water Quality Measurements and Concerns
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), an agency under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, identified the water as unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. [[water_quality_measurements_at_mahakumbh | Water quality measurements]] are primarily based on two key indicators:

### Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
BOD measures the oxygen required by aerobic microorganisms to break down organic matter in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. High BOD levels indicate significant organic material, such as sewage, waste, or decaying plant matter, leading to lower oxygen levels in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Ideally, BOD should be 0 mg/litre for drinkable water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. CPCB considers water drinkable if BOD is below 1 mg/litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   For safe bathing, BOD should be below 3 mg/litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

**BOD Levels during Mahakumbh (as per CPCB data)**:
*   January 13, 2025 (Mahakumbh start): 3.94 mg/litre at Sangam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   January 16: 5.09 mg/litre at Sangam (nearly twice the limit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   January 24: 4.08 mg/litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   January 19: 5.29 mg/litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Faecal Coliform Bacteria (FCB)
Faecal Coliform is a type of bacteria found in human and animal feces and is a key indicator of water quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   The desirable level of FCB is 500 MPN per 100 ml, with a maximum acceptable level of 2,500 MPN per 100 ml for bathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   World Health Organization (WHO) standards for drinkable water recommend 0 MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

**FCB Levels during Mahakumbh (as per CPCB data)**:
*   January 20: 49,000 MPN per 100 ml at Sangam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Just before Sangam, Yamuna river water contained 33,000 MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   February 4: 11,000 MPN at Shastri pool on Ganga and 7,900 MPN at Sangam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   Sewage drains, like Jondhwal, Rajapur, and Salori, showed FCB levels exceeding 3.4 million MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

The CPCB concluded that the river was not suitable for bathing at any monitored location during the Mahakumbh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Government's Response and Allegations of Cover-up
[[government_efforts_and_failures_to_clean_ganga | Government efforts and failures to clean Ganga]] became evident through its response to these pollution reports.

### Dilution Efforts
During the Mahakumbh, the government released freshwater multiple times into the Ganga to dilute the pollution, rather than cleaning the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### National Green Tribunal (NGT) Scrutiny
The National Green Tribunal (NGT), a parliamentary body for environmental disputes, questioned the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) regarding water safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   UPPCB initially claimed the water was suitable for bathing, submitting older water samples from January 12 (before Mahakumbh) and omitting faecal coliform data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   On February 20, NGT criticized UPPCB for providing old, irrelevant data and failing to include crucial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   UPPCB has faced accusations of using unscientific methods and providing incorrect reports, with differing results from IIT Varanasi and Banaras Hindu University on samples from the same locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The Allahabad High Court questioned UPPCB on this in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### The "Self-Purifying Properties" Narrative
When facing scrutiny, the government issued a press release citing an unverified report by "scientist" Dr. Ajay Sonkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This report claimed no bacterial growth in Ganga water samples at five ghats, including the Sangam, and stated the river has [[selfpurification_properties_of_the_ganga | self-purifying properties]] due to 1,100 types of bacteriophages (viruses that kill harmful bacteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   While research confirms Ganga possesses some [[selfpurification_properties_of_the_ganga | self-purifying properties]] and bacteriophages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, a 2020 research states that the pollution load has increased beyond the river's capacity to self-clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   Dr. Ajay Sonkar's alleged research lacks publication details in any journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   Researchers from IIT Delhi published a 2023 paper in the Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, finding a large number of disease-causing bacteria in Ganga water samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   The chronology suggests a deliberate effort to mislead: Sonkar's announcement on February 20 (after NGT criticism), the UP government's press release on February 21, and its spread via social media by February 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   The government's promotion of unverified research while refuting its own agencies' data raises questions about its intentions, especially given the ₹400 billion spent on the Namami Ganga Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Health Impacts of Polluted Water
Bathing in such polluted water can cause serious health issues, including skin diseases, gastrointestinal infections, cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
[[impact_of_polluted_water_on_public_health | Impact of polluted water on public health]] was evident after the Mahakumbh:
*   A senior consultant at Delhi's Indraprastha Apollo Hospital reported an increase in medical problems among people returning from Kumbh, including diarrhea, vomiting, and fevers of unknown origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   Breathing problems were also common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   A 2022 CPCB report stated that about 70% of waterborne diseases in India are caused by river water pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Government Promises and Reality
Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Namami Ganga Project in 2014, with significant funds allocated (₹330 billion by 2023, exceeding ₹400 billion by 2024) to clean the Ganga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Despite these expenditures, the water remains too polluted for bathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Deadlines for cleaning the river have been repeatedly postponed, from 2020 to 2022, and now targeting 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath claimed the water at Sangam was fit for drinking and bathing, despite evidence of faecal bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   The government's continued denial of the pollution problem hinders effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   The Sabarmati River, often showcased for its riverfront beautification, was the second most polluted river in India in 2023, with BOD levels as high as 345 mg/litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This highlights that beautification does not equate to cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Treatment of Environmental Activists
GD Agarwal, a former IIT Kanpur professor who became Swami Gyan Swaroop Sanand, dedicated his life to the Ganga River. He was instrumental in Ganga being awarded the title of National River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. In 2018, at age 86, he undertook a 111-day hunger strike to save Ganga, writing multiple letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who remained silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. He passed away during the strike, and the Prime Minister, who had previously claimed to be "called by Mother Ganga," only tweeted afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the government's public embrace of controversial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This situation reflects broader [[environmental_pollution_and_regulatory_challenges_in_india | environmental pollution and regulatory challenges in India]].

### Safer Locations
While the lower stretches of Ganga are heavily polluted, the water upstream, specifically in Rishikesh, is still considered fit for bathing and drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. The situation between Haridwar and Kanpur is fair, but pollution significantly increases after Kanpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

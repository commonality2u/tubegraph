World War II stands as the most devastating war in human history, leaving numerous large cities crumbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Today, many geopolitical events and international relations can be traced back to this conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The war, which ultimately set the stage for later global dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, was not sparked by a single event, but rather a series of conspiring events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Seeds of Conflict: The Treaty of Versailles

The origins of World War II can be traced back to 1919, the year World War I ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06">[01:06]</a>. This peace treaty included Article 231, also known as the War Guilt Clause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26">[01:26]</a>, which placed sole responsibility for all losses from World War I upon Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19">[01:19]</a>. France and Britain, aiming to recover their own losses, demanded that Germany pay a staggering $33 billion in fines, equivalent to about $270 billion in today's currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40">[01:40]</a>. Germany made its final payment of this fine in 2010, nearly 100 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>.

The first payment in 1921 led to hyperinflation in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09">[02:09]</a>. The German Mark rapidly devalued, with a packet of bread costing 160 Marks in Berlin in 1922, and then 200 billion Marks in 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27">[02:27]</a>. This crippled the economy and caused unemployment to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37">[02:37]</a>.

## The [[rise_of_adolf_hitler | Rise of Adolf Hitler]]

Into this distressed environment entered [[rise_of_adolf_hitler | Adolf Hitler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41">[02:41]</a>. As a young political leader skilled at manipulating the masses through speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46">[02:46]</a>, Hitler's Nazi Party attempted a coup against the German government in 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[02:51]</a>. Though unsuccessful, this attempt significantly boosted his popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>.

Propaganda spread rumors that "anti-national" elements, specifically Jews and Socialists, were responsible for Germany's humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>. The Great Depression in 1929 further worsened unemployment, with 6 million people jobless in Germany by 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>. Amidst this suffering, Hitler declared himself the Dictator of Germany in 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>.

Upon gaining control, Hitler pursued his vision of a racially pure German Empire, or "German Reich," for people of the Aryan race, excluding Jews and Slavs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>. The Judeo Bolshevism conspiracy theory was used to fuel hatred, claiming Jews were behind the 1917 Russian Revolution and the formation of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>.

## Violation of Treaties and Early Expansion

In 1935, Germany openly violated the Treaty of Versailles by revealing it had an air force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30">[04:30]</a>, which the treaty explicitly forbade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38">[04:38]</a>. Despite this, Britain, believing the treaty to be unfair, signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in June 1935, formally recognizing Hitler's authority to form a navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>. This growing militarization alarmed France, prompting them to build the 450 km long Maginot Line fortification on their Eastern border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14">[05:14]</a>.

With his military sufficiently prepared by 1938, Hitler turned his attention to Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>, intending to unite all German-speaking countries into one nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>. His goal was not just conquest but also to acquire resources and provide "Lebensraum" (living space) for his "racially superior" Aryan race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45">[05:45]</a>.

In February 1938, Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg was forced to sign an agreement allowing pro-Nazi individuals into the Austrian government, effectively infiltrating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59">[05:59]</a>. When the Chancellor decided to hold a national vote on Austria's independence, Hitler marched his army into Austria in March 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44">[06:44]</a>. The Chancellor resigned to avoid bloodshed, and Hitler's propaganda ministry spread fake news of riots, leading the Austrian government to "request" German military help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58">[06:58]</a>. The Austrian Parliament was dissolved the next day, and Austria ceased to be independent, largely due to pre-existing pro-Hitler sentiment among the Austrian populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11">[07:11]</a>.

Next, Hitler targeted Czechoslovakia, specifically the Sudetenland region, where 3 million Germans resided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36">[07:36]</a>. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain sought to avoid war by signing the Munich Agreement in September 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54">[07:54]</a>. This agreement ceded the Sudetenland to Germany on Hitler's promise of no further aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25">[08:25]</a>. However, less than a year later, in March 1939, Hitler violated the agreement, invading the rest of Czechoslovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36">[08:36]</a>. The country was then split, with one part absorbed into German territory and the other becoming a Nazi client state called the Slovak Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49">[08:49]</a>. This led to heavy criticism of Chamberlain, with Winston Churchill famously stating, "You were given the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour and you will have war!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06">[09:06]</a>.

## The Invasion of Poland and the Start of War

Hitler's next target was Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15">[09:15]</a>. To facilitate this, he signed a Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union in 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19">[09:19]</a>, aligning their interests in partitioning Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33">[09:33]</a>. On September 1, 1939, nearly 1 million German troops invaded Poland from the North and South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42">[09:42]</a>.

The UK and France, at their breaking point, issued an ultimatum: withdraw from Poland or face war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51">[09:51]</a>. Hitler ignored it, leading the UK to officially declare war on Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04">[10:04]</a>, followed by France, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19">[10:19]</a>.

Despite these declarations, the period was initially known as the "Phony War" as no military support was provided to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44">[10:44]</a>. Poland's old-fashioned army, still relying on horses, was quickly defeated by the German military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59">[10:59]</a>. By September 8, 1939, German troops occupied Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18">[11:18]</a>. The Soviet Union also invaded from the other side, and Poland was partitioned, half going to Nazi Germany and the other half to the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00">[13:00]</a>.

### The [[blitzkrieg_military_strategy | Blitzkrieg Military Strategy]]

Key to Hitler's rapid conquests was his revolutionary [[blitzkrieg_military_strategy | Blitzkrieg military strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25">[11:25]</a>. This strategy focused on speed and stealth, using tanks to invade countries quickly, followed by air support from the Luftwaffe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33">[11:33]</a>. "Blitz" means lightning in German, reflecting the lightning-speed invasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52">[11:52]</a>.

To sustain the Blitzkrieg, German soldiers were given drugs like Pervitin (Crystal Meth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01">[12:01]</a>. This drug eliminated fatigue, hunger, thirst, reduced pain, and boosted confidence, allowing soldiers to fight day and night, completing invasions in days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23">[12:23]</a>.

### Soviet Expansion: The Winter War

From the Soviet perspective, Finland, previously part of the Russian Empire, was a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21">[13:21]</a>. Stalin feared a German invasion of Finland, which would place them perilously close to Leningrad, his residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28">[13:28]</a>. When Finland refused to hand over territory, the Soviets launched military action in what became known as the Winter War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48">[13:48]</a>. Despite the Soviet Union's larger and better-equipped army, the war lasted over two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06">[14:06]</a>. It concluded in March 1940 with the Moscow Peace Treaty, ceding 11% of Finland's land to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19">[14:19]</a>.

## German Conquests of 1940: Western Europe

While the Soviets engaged Finland, Hitler focused on Norway and Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28">[14:28]</a>. Using his [[blitzkrieg_military_strategy | Blitzkrieg military strategy]], he invaded both countries on April 9, 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42">[14:42]</a>. Both fell quickly, with the Norwegian government fleeing to London to set up a Government in Exile, and Hitler establishing a puppet pro-Nazi government in Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54">[14:54]</a>.

Following these failures to protect neighboring countries, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigned on May 10, 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05">[15:05]</a>. Winston Churchill famously assumed the role of Prime Minister on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37">[15:37]</a>.

### The Battle of France and Dunkirk Evacuation

On May 10, 1940, Hitler launched an all-out war, attacking France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43">[15:43]</a>. The French troops lined their Maginot Line wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57">[15:57]</a>, and Allied forces were stationed on the borders of Belgium and Luxembourg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18">[16:18]</a>.

The "Battle of France" involved over 1,000 fighter-bomber airplanes and around 3 million German ground soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27">[16:27]</a>. German troops were divided into three groups:
*   **Group B** attacked the Netherlands and Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39">[16:39]</a>.
*   **Group C** launched a diversionary attack on the Maginot Line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47">[16:47]</a>.
*   **Group A**, the master plan, secretly entered France through the Ardennes Forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53">[16:53]</a>, an area French military experts considered an impenetrable fortress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05">[17:05]</a>.

On May 15, 1940, Group A captured Sedan and began moving Northwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25">[17:25]</a>. This sudden attack from behind caught British forces fighting Group B in Belgium by surprise, surrounding them on three sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30">[17:30]</a>. Their only escape route was by sea, near the port of Dunkirk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45">[17:45]</a>.

Nearly 400,000 Allied troops (British and French armies) were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk, with the Nazi army rapidly advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54">[17:54]</a>. Winston Churchill devised Operation Dynamo, launched on May 26, 1940, the biggest evacuation in military history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36">[18:36]</a>. Under constant attack from German ground forces and the Luftwaffe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48">[18:48]</a>, the evacuation involved:
*   British Royal Air Force counter-attacks providing cover for ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06">[19:06]</a>.
*   Private fishing boats and common civilians helping in the evacuation from the English Channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15">[19:15]</a>.
*   Soldiers on Dunkirk's beach saving and helping each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23">[19:23]</a>.

By June 4, 1940, approximately 350,000 soldiers were successfully evacuated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37">[19:37]</a>. However, most of the Allied forces' military equipment was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46">[19:46]</a>. A few days later, on June 22, 1940, France surrendered to Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50">[19:50]</a>.

## Alliances and Shifting Dynamics

By this point, Dictator Mussolini in Italy formed an alliance with Hitler, known as the Pact of Steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56">[19:56]</a>, declaring war against France and Britain on June 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09">[20:09]</a>. The countries fighting Hitler became known as the Allies, while those supporting Hitler were the Axis Powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06">[20:06]</a>.

By July 1940, Hitler had established control over nearly all neighboring countries, including Austria, Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14">[20:14]</a>. With a peace agreement in place with the Soviet Union, Hitler believed Britain was the only remaining opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30">[20:30]</a>. The United States had not yet become involved in World War II, maintaining neutrality after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46">[20:46]</a>. At this juncture, Hitler held a major upper hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04">[21:04]</a>.

The summers in recent years have seen unprecedented heat, with the year 2022 being called the "Hottest Summer Ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This year, temperatures in India broke a 122-year-old record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The summer of 2023 was declared the hottest in the last 2,000 years in the Northern Hemisphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This trend continued into 2024, with January, February, March, and April all recording their hottest temperatures ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, making the last 11 months record-breaking in terms of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

This extreme heat is not normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> and is affecting regions beyond India. Last month, South India and the entire Southeast Asia experienced record-breaking heat waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Countries like Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia faced unbearable temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, with the Philippines recording a [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | heat index]] of over 53°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Within India, forest fires were reported in Uttarakhand in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, and heat wave warnings have been issued across the country, including in places like Kerala where they are unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Temperatures in North India have soared above 46°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

While global warming and climate change are significant factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, other reasons contribute to these extreme conditions.

## Global Extreme Weather Events

Such extreme weather events are not confined to India or Southeast Asia; they are observed worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:
*   **Brazil Floods**: In South America, Southern Brazil experienced devastating floods, resulting in at least 83 deaths and over 150,000 displaced people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Entire cities were submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **South Africa Drought**: Southern Africa is suffering from a severe drought, described by community elders as unparalleled since 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Many countries in the region have requested $5.5 billion in aid to avert starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## El Niño and La Niña Climate Patterns

A major weather event behind much of this destruction is **El Niño** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)**: This is a natural climate cycle of the Earth, occurring every 5-7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. However, due to climate change, it is becoming more extreme annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The World Health Organization identifies ENSO as the second biggest cause of global climate change, after the Earth's relationship with the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Mechanism of El Niño**: El Niño phenomena occur in the Pacific Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Normally, Trade Winds blow from east to west (from the Americas towards Asia and Australia) due to the Coriolis effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This pushes warm surface water towards Australia, leading to more rain there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Simultaneously, colder, nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean rises near South America, a process called Upwelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   During an El Niño event, these Trade Winds weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Upwelling diminishes, and warm surface water remains in the central and eastern Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This shifts rainfall patterns; regions like Australia become very dry, increasing the risk of heat waves and wildfires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, as seen with the 2020 Australian wildfires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Conversely, South America experiences increased rainfall and a higher risk of floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, explaining the devastating floods in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Recent El Niño Events**: The last major El Niño event was from 2018-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Another El Niño has been in effect from January 2023 until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This El Niño is a significant reason for the hot summers in 2023 and 2024, the droughts in Southern Africa, and even the heavy rains and floods in Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Scientists believe human-caused climate change is intensifying El Niño's effects, leading to more dangerous floods and violent heat waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

*   **La Niña**: This is the opposite phenomenon of El Niño <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. During La Niña, the Trade Winds strengthen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, pushing even more cold water towards South America and hot water towards Australia, leading to increased rainfall in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. La Niña events typically last longer, from 1 to 4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. After the 2018-19 El Niño, an extreme La Niña in 2020-21 caused severe flooding in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Current Forecast**: The El Niño graph is currently trending downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, with scientists predicting La Niña could begin by July-August 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This could result in a better-than-average monsoon season for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, contrasting with the lower rainfall in 2023 due to El Niño <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Understanding Heatwaves and Perception

The Indian Meteorological Department has specific criteria for declaring a heat wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>:
*   **Heat Wave**: If temperatures in plains exceed 40°C, coastal areas 37°C, or mountains 30°C, *and* the temperature is 4.5°C above normal for two consecutive days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. A heat wave is also declared if the temperature crosses 45°C regardless of other conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Severe Heat Wave**: Declared if the temperature is 6.4°C above normal for two consecutive days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### The Role of [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | Humidity]] and [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | Heat Index]]
Actual temperature alone is not the most useful metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | Humidity]] plays a crucial role in how heat is perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | Relative Humidity]]**: This indicates the maximum moisture content in the air at a given temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Hotter air can hold more moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Impact of [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | Humidity]]**: As [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | humidity]] increases, it becomes harder for sweat to evaporate from our bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Sweating is the primary way our bodies cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. If sweat cannot evaporate, the body cannot cool itself, which can be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | Heat Index]]**: This metric combines both temperature and [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | humidity]] to indicate how hot the weather truly "feels" to a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. For example, 35°C with 50% [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | relative humidity]] feels like 41°C, but at 75% [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | humidity]], it feels like a dangerous 53°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, categorized as "extreme danger" with a high risk of heat stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This is why the recent heat wave in the Philippines was so dangerous, with its [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | heat index]] reaching 53°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Delhi vs. Mumbai**: While Delhi might have higher absolute temperatures, Mumbai's higher [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | humidity]] often makes its lower temperatures feel more unbearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Delhi's [[role_of_humidity_and_heat_index_in_heat_perception_and_health_risks | heat index]] is now touching 50°C and could reach 56°C in the coming days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## The [[urban_heat_island_effect_and_urban_planning | Urban Heat Island Effect]]

Another local factor intensifying heat waves is the [[urban_heat_island_effect_and_urban_planning | Urban Heat Island Effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Areas within cities, particularly those with dense concrete buildings, glass structures, asphalt roads, and limited ventilation, absorb and retain heat during the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This absorbed heat is then released at night, making these areas significantly hotter than green spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Impact in Delhi**: A study in Delhi found that areas with the [[urban_heat_island_effect_and_urban_planning | urban heat island effect]], such as Connaught Place and Bhikaji Cama Place, were 3°C to 8°C hotter than green areas like Hauz Khas District Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## Solutions and Mitigation Strategies

Addressing extreme heat requires local-level solutions:
*   **Urban Planning and Greenery**:
    *   Development should prioritize walkable areas and sufficient greenery over extensive road networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
    *   Minimizing car usage is crucial, as vehicles also release heat, exacerbating the [[urban_heat_island_effect_and_urban_planning | Urban Heat Island Effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
    *   Cities like Paris are actively banning cars, removing asphalt, and planting trees to reduce heat and promote cycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
    *   Promoting public transport is a vital alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
    *   Governments need to focus on making cities greener with more trees and parks to minimize the impact of heat waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Building Design**:
    *   Reducing reliance on air conditioners, which release heat outdoors and intensify the [[urban_heat_island_effect_and_urban_planning | Urban Heat Island Effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
    *   Incorporating natural ventilation into building design to minimize the need for AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, a practice historically used in ancient buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
    *   Painting roofs white to reflect sunlight can reduce indoor temperatures by 2°C to 3°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
    *   Planting greenery or grass on roofs can also serve as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Radiant Cooling**:
    *   This technology involves installing pipes in walls through which cold water flows, cooling the house without an AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
    *   It is an old concept, similar to how ancient forts and monuments like the Taj Mahal used water channels to cool surrounding areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   Promoting this technology can keep cities cooler and reduce electricity bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

## Future Projections
These solutions need urgent implementation, as heat waves are projected to become more dangerous and impactful in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. A recent study, "Future Projections for the Tropical Indian Ocean," suggests that permanent marine heat waves could occur in the Indian Ocean within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. By 2050, many areas could experience heat waves lasting 220 to 250 days a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

Public fascination with [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] is deeply intertwined with a widespread UFO craze that began in the mid-20th century, particularly following the [[Roswell Incident analysis | Roswell Incident]]. The strict secrecy surrounding [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] has fueled numerous [[conspiracy theories about the moon landing | conspiracy theories]], despite repeated government clarifications.

## Origins of the UFO Craze and the [[Roswell Incident analysis | Roswell Incident]]

In July 1947, a widespread UFO craze gripped America, with people across the country reporting sightings of flying saucers [00:00:02]. This phenomenon began on June 24, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen nine shining UFOs near Seattle, flying at speeds of 2,000 km/h [00:00:13]. Within two weeks, reports of flying UFOs emerged from all over America, sparking intense media discussion [00:00:38]. Media outlets linked these sightings to atomic sites, noting that areas with the most UFO reports were also sites of nuclear tests [00:00:51].

Meanwhile, in New Mexico, a man named Mac Brazel found unusual debris—tin foil, rubber, and a thin wooden beam—on his field [00:01:02]. Wondering if it was connected to the UFO craze, he took the debris to the Roswell Sheriff on July 7 [00:01:17]. This caught the attention of Colonel William Blanchard, commanding officer of the Roswell Army Airfield (RAAF) [00:01:26]. The next day, RAAF issued a statement confirming that "the rumours of the flying disks had come true," and that the "509th Bomb Group... was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disk" [00:01:34].

However, the very next day, US Army Officials retracted their statement, claiming the debris was from a weather balloon [00:01:55]. Photos of Major Marcel with pieces of the weather balloon were released as proof, and the news largely died down, with the public losing interest [00:02:04].

### Resurgence of Alien Theories

Years later, in the late 1970s, rumors re-emerged about an alien craft crashing in the New Mexico desert after being struck by lightning, killing the aliens inside [00:02:20]. In 1980, Major Marcel published *The [[Roswell Incident analysis | Roswell Incident]]*, claiming the debris he saw was "from nothing made 'on this Earth'" [00:02:39].

This led to new theories, with some people claiming a living alien was discovered at the crash site and subsequently held at a secret base, possibly [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]], where the US Army was allegedly attempting to reverse-engineer alien technology [00:02:54].

## [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]]: The Veil of Secrecy

[[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] is a US Military facility located deep within a desert, miles from the nearest cities [00:03:51]. Trespassing is strictly prohibited, with signs warning that suspicious activity "would be met with deadly force" [00:03:58]. The extreme secrecy has long fueled public speculation about its true purpose.

## The "Storm [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]]" Event (2019)

In June 2019, podcaster Joe Rogan interviewed Bob Lazar, a figure known for his belief in UFOs [00:04:26]. Lazar claimed he was a researcher at [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]], tasked with reverse-engineering alien technology to improve modern tech [00:04:39].

> "This project was to back-engineer the alien craft. I went through the hangar door, and inside the hangar door was the disk, the flying saucer that I worked on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

Inspired by this, college student Matty Roberts created a Facebook event, "Storm [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]], They Can't Stop All Of Us" [00:05:10]. The prank event suggested people gather at [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] at 3 AM on September 20, 2019, to infiltrate the facility, even humorously suggesting a "Naruto Run" to "dodge the bullets" [00:05:31].

Despite being a prank, the event gained immense traction, with over 2 million people confirming their attendance by August end [00:06:15]. Roberts became "scared" and publicly stated he was not responsible [00:06:26].

In reality, storming [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] is logistically challenging due to its isolation [00:07:09]. The nearest village, Rachel, had a population of only 54 in 2019 [00:07:34]. [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] is located on the Nevada Test and Training Range, a vast government-controlled land, adjacent to the Nevada Test Site, where nuclear weapons were tested from the 1950s to the 1990s [00:07:48].

On the day of the event, only about 6,000 people showed up, significantly fewer than the 2 million who RSVP'd or the 30,000 expected by the military [00:15:13]. The event largely turned into a peaceful "Alienstock" music party, with no attempts to infiltrate the facility [00:15:01]. However, the increased police presence cost approximately $300,000 [00:15:46].

## The True History of [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] and UFOs

[[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] was established during the Cold War as a testing and development facility for aircraft [00:08:41]. Its secrecy stemmed from its role in developing critical military assets, such as the U-2 Spy plane and the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird [00:09:01].

### CIA's Role in UFO Narratives

The CIA used the widespread UFO [[conspiracy theories about the moon landing | conspiracy theory]] as a cover for their secret aircraft testing [00:12:37]. When strange, fast-flying objects were sighted, the CIA neither confirmed nor denied claims of alien origins, allowing people to believe they were alien flying saucers [00:12:48]. This diverted attention from the fact that these were top-secret US military aircraft [00:13:09]. The initial one-day media frenzy around the [[Roswell Incident analysis | Roswell Incident]]'s "flying disk" was part of this strategy, before the story was retracted to avoid public panic over actual alien encounters [00:13:17].

The re-emergence of UFO rumors in the 1970s coincided with the testing of the SR-71 Blackbird aircraft [00:13:49]. The U-2 and SR-71 planes flew at exceptionally high altitudes (21,000m and 24,000m respectively) and were often tested just before sunset [00:11:08]. When the sun's rays hit these unconventional, fast-moving aircraft, they would appear as unidentified flying objects to observers [00:17:06]. Most UFO sightings are believed to be military drones, decoy flares, or other unknown military air infrastructure mistaken for alien craft [00:17:24].

### Debunking Bob Lazar's Claims

Conspiracy theorist Bob Lazar, who claimed to have worked on alien technology at [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]]'s Sector 4 (S-4) in 1989, has been widely discredited [00:14:20]. Experts believe his claims are fabricated, and it was revealed that he had a fake degree from MIT [00:18:19]. Lazar's assertion that alien spacecraft were powered by "Element 115," which could create its own gravitational field, was disproven when Russian scientists produced the element (Moscovium) in 2003, confirming it does not create a gravitational field [00:18:51].

## [[Government stance on UFOs and UAPs | Government Stance on UFOs and UAPs]]

The truth about the [[Roswell Incident analysis | Roswell Incident]] debris was revealed in 1994 when the US Airforce announced it was a nuclear surveillance balloon developed under Project Mogul, designed to detect sound waves from Soviet nuclear tests [00:15:58]. The government's previous "misstatements" contributed to public skepticism, allowing [[conspiracy theories about the moon landing | conspiracy theories]] to persist even after the truth was revealed [00:16:21].

In June 2013, the CIA publicly acknowledged the [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] base and declassified details of its history under the Freedom of Information Act [00:19:33]. Further declassified documents were released in January 2017 and January 2021, including records of UFO sightings and CIA experiments [00:20:23].

Today, the US [[Government stance on UFOs and UAPs | government]] uses the term Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) instead of UFO, to dissociate from the alien connotations [00:21:16]. In December 2020, the US government directed intelligence agencies to release all records on UAPs to the public [00:21:33]. The US Pentagon released three videos of UAPs in April 2020, acknowledging their authenticity, and in August 2020, the Defense Department created a UAP Task Force to detect, analyze, and catalogue UAPs due to potential national security threats [00:21:52]. While many UAPs are eventually identified as balloons or other known objects, some remain unexplained due to insufficient data [00:22:40]. It is believed these unidentified UAPs may be part of highly classified programs by other countries [00:22:55].

[[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] continues to be a site for testing next-generation aircraft [00:23:02]. The state of Nevada has capitalized on the public's fascination, renaming a highway to "Extraterrestrial Highway" in 1996 to promote tourism [00:23:19]. Despite the public interest, [[Area 51 and military secrecy | Area 51]] remains an active military facility, and trespassing is strictly enforced, leading to arrests for those who attempt to enter [00:23:36].

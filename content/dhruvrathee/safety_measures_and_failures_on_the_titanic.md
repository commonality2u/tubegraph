The [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | RMS Titanic]], launched on April 10, 1912, from Southampton, England, on its maiden voyage to New York, was considered the world's largest and most luxurious ship of its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Measuring 269 meters in length and over 53 meters high, its construction cost $7.5 million in 1912, equivalent to $400 million today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The ship featured elaborate amenities, including stained glass mirrors, ornate wood paneling, two grand staircases, a heated swimming pool, a Turkish bath, an electric bath, a gym, a squash court, four restaurants, two barber shops, and a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Belief in "Unsinkability"

The [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] was widely believed to be "unsinkable" due to its impressive safety features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The Vice President of White Star Line, the company that built the ship, publicly declared it unsinkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Key safety features included:
*   **Double Bottom Hull** The main body of the ship, known as the hull, had a double-bottomed design with two layers. The theory was that if the outer layer was damaged, the second layer would protect the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Watertight Compartments** The hull was divided into 16 separate watertight compartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It was believed that even if four of these compartments were filled with water, the ship would still remain afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Failures Leading to Disaster

Despite its advanced design, several critical failures and oversights contributed to the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]]'s sinking.

### Ignored Iceberg Warnings

Beginning April 12, 1912, two days after its departure, the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] started receiving ice warnings about the Atlantic Ocean being "replete with ice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While the ship changed its course twice to avoid danger, it crucially did not reduce its speed, continuing at 21.5 knots (40 km/hr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. On April 14, 1912, seven additional ice warnings were issued, but Captain Edward John Smith and his crew reportedly ignored them and maintained full speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Poor Visibility and Lookout Conditions

The night of April 14 was moonless, resulting in extremely low visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The lookout, Fredrick Fleet, stationed in the crow's nest, faced severe cold winds that caused his eyes to tear up, further hindering his vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. At 11:39 PM, Fleet spotted a huge iceberg, rang the bell three times, and alerted the bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Impact and Structural Damage

At 11:40 PM, just one minute after the warning, the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] collided with the iceberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The iceberg, estimated to be 200x400 feet in length and weighing 1.5 million tons, grazed the ship's front right side, specifically near the bow, for about 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This impact created a massive dent and numerous small holes in the ship's main body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Failure of Safety Features

*   **Double Bottom Hull Ineffectiveness** The double bottom hull proved useless because the impact occurred on the side of the ship, which only had a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Breached Watertight Compartments** The collision was so severe that six of the 16 watertight compartments were breached and began filling with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Since the ship could only remain afloat with up to four compartments breached, the inundation of six meant the ship could not be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Insufficient Lifeboats

A significant failure was the inadequate number of lifeboats on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. There were only 20 lifeboats, which could accommodate approximately 1,200 people, while there were around 2,200 passengers and crew aboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This scarcity was due to the company's belief that the ship was unsinkable, rendering more lifeboats unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The first lifeboat was lowered with only 28 people, despite having a capacity of 65, as passengers were not initially scared due to the "unsinkable" assurances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Lack of Safety Drills

Captain Smith had not conducted any safety drills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. A drill scheduled for the day of the collision was canceled, again because the captain believed it was unnecessary for an unsinkable ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Steersman's Mistake

Steersman Robert Hichens, at the steering wheel, misunderstood the officer's instruction to turn left after the iceberg alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. In a moment of panic, he steered the ship to the right, directly towards the iceberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. By the time he realized his error, it was too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Pressure to Maintain Speed

A popular theory suggests that Joseph Bruce Ismay, the chairman and managing director of White Star Line, pressured Captain Smith to maintain the ship's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. There was immense company pressure to complete the maiden voyage in six days to set a record, showcasing the [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] as the fastest ship, not just the biggest and most expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. On April 14, when Captain Smith showed Ismay an ice warning and suggested reducing speed, Ismay allegedly hid the paper to prevent the crew and passengers from finding out, ensuring the speed was not slowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### The Nearby SS Californian

A shocking revelation during the [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | investigation]] was that another ship, the SS Californian, was only 37 kilometers away from the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] that night and could have reached it in time to save passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   The SS Californian had issued the last iceberg warning one hour before the collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   At 11:15 PM, the Californian's radio operator switched off the radio for the night, meaning they did not receive the [[rescue_efforts_and_the_sinking_aftermath | Titanic]]'s distress signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   The Californian had stopped for the night due to the danger of icebergs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   Passengers on the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]]'s deck could see the Californian on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   Despite flares and rockets being fired from the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]], Captain Stanley Lord of the Californian insisted they were not distress signals but fireworks from a party aboard the [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Both inquiries into the disaster placed blame on Captain Lord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

The [[the_titanics_maiden_voyage_and_iceberg_collision_timeline | Titanic]] sank within three hours of the collision, at approximately 2:20 AM on April 15, 1912, after breaking into two halves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Of the 1,500 people still on board, many drowned or died from hypothermia in the -2 degrees Celsius water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

The disaster led to worldwide changes in maritime safety regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>:
*   **International Ice Patrol (1914)** Established to warn oncoming ships about icebergs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)** Signed in 1914, this treaty set new standards for ships, including mandatory lifeboat regulations ensuring sufficient capacity for every passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

The [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | Titanic]]'s wreckage was not found until September 1985 by American ocean explorer Robert Ballard and a French oceanographer, lying 3,800 meters under the sea in two separate pieces, 600 meters apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. The wreck is currently eroding due to bacteria and other organisms eating its metal framework, with expectations that it will completely disintegrate by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

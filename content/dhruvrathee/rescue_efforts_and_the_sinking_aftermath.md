The incident of April 10, 1912, involved the RMS Titanic, the world's largest and most luxurious ship of its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It embarked on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Commanded by 62-year-old Senior Captain Edward John Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, the ship was widely believed to be "unsinkable" due to its advanced [[safety_measures_and_failures_on_the_titanic | safety features]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Collision and Initial Assessment

After receiving multiple ice warnings, which the captain and crew largely ignored, the Titanic continued its journey at a speed of 21.5 knots (40 km/hr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. On the night of April 14, 1912, visibility was low due to the absence of moonlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. At 11:39 PM, lookout Fredrick Fleet spotted a huge iceberg and alerted the bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Despite an immediate steering order, it was too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. At 11:40 PM, the ship collided with the iceberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The iceberg, estimated to weigh 1.5 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, caused a huge dent and small holes in the main body of the ship's front right side, near the bow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Moments after the collision, Captain Smith and architect Thomas Andrews assessed the damage, realizing the ship would sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The ship's double-bottom hull was ineffective against the side impact, and six of its sixteen watertight compartments were breached, exceeding the limit of four, meaning the ship could not be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Distress Calls and Limited Response

Twenty minutes after the collision, at 12:00 AM, Captain Smith ordered a distress call to be sent via radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Senior radio operator Jack Phillips continuously sent distress signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Flares and rockets were also launched into the sky to attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### The Arrival of RMS Carpathia

Approximately twenty minutes later, at 12:20 AM, the RMS Carpathia, located 107 km away from the Titanic, detected the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The Carpathia immediately directed its ship towards the Titanic, but even at top speed, it would take 3.5 hours to reach the location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Unfortunately, apart from the Carpathia, no other ships responded to the distress calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Carpathia eventually reached the site between 3:30 AM and 4:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### The Failure of SS Californian to Assist

A shocking fact that surfaced later was the presence of another ship, the SS Californian, just 37 km away from the Titanic that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The Californian had issued the last iceberg warning one hour before the collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. However, at 11:15 PM, the Californian's radio operator switched off the radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The ship had stopped for the night due to the danger of icebergs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Because its radio was off, the Californian did not receive the Titanic's distress signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The Californian was so close that passengers on the Titanic's deck could see it on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. After 12 AM, crew members on the Californian even observed rockets fired from the Titanic but Captain Stanley Lord dismissed them as signals from rich passengers partying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Had Captain Lord taken these signals seriously, many lives could have been saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. When the Californian switched its radio on the next morning, it received the SOS calls but arrived too late, finding only dead bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Lifeboat Scarcity and Evacuation

Captain Smith ordered the [[rescue_and_evacuation_efforts_of_costa_concordia_passengers | evacuation of passengers]] using lifeboats, prioritizing women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. However, most passengers were not scared, believing the Titanic was unsinkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. As a result, the first lifeboat, with a capacity for 65 people, was lowered with only 28 on board, leaving half empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

As water filled the compartments and the ship began to tilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, passengers slowly realized the ship was indeed sinking, leading to chaos and panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. A major problem was the scarcity of lifeboats; there were only 20, capable of accommodating approximately 1,200 people, while around 2,200 were aboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## The Final Moments of the Sinking

By 1:00 AM, the bow of the ship had gone underwater, causing the rear part and propellers to surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The ship's severe tilt caused pandemonium, with people fighting for space in the remaining lifeboats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The last lifeboat was lowered at 2:05 AM, leaving 1,500 people still on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

> "The end was chaotic. Everybody was crying, praying, trying to get into the few lifeboats that were left. Oh... it was, um, pretty sad at the end." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>

According to eyewitnesses, the ship broke into two halves at around 2:20 AM and slowly sank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The "unsinkable" ship sank in less than three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Post-Sinking Casualties

Of the 1,500 people who remained on board, many drowned with the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Those who knew how to swim died from hypothermia, as the water temperature was -2 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Falling into such cold water leads to death within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Captain Edward Smith reportedly stayed at the wheel until the end and drowned with the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | Investigations and Legacy of the Titanic Disaster]]

Following the disaster, inquiries were conducted, revealing unknown facts and controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The inquiries primarily blamed Captain Lord of the SS Californian for not responding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. However, other factors also contributed:
*   **Insufficient Lifeboats:** The ship's manufacturer believed it was unsinkable, deeming more lifeboats unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Cancelled Safety Drills:** Captain Smith cancelled a safety drill scheduled for the day of the collision, also believing it unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Steersman's Mistake:** Steersman Robert Hichens, in a moment of panic, steered the ship to the right (towards the iceberg) instead of the instructed left, delaying avoidance maneuvers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Speed:** Despite numerous iceberg warnings, the ship continued at full speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. A popular theory suggests Joseph Bruce, chairman of White Star Line, pressured Captain Smith to maintain speed to set a record for the fastest voyage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. It's reported that Joseph even concealed an ice warning from Captain Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

The Titanic disaster led to significant changes in the maritime industry worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **International Ice Patrol:** Established in 1914 to warn ships about icebergs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **SOLAS Treaty:** The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) was signed, setting new standards for ships, including a mandate for sufficient lifeboats for every passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

### Discovery of the Wreckage

It took over 70 years to find the Titanic's wreckage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. In September 1985, American ocean explorer Robert Ballard and a French oceanographer located the Titanic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The wreckage was found 3,800 meters (3.8 km) under the sea, consisting of two separate pieces 600 meters apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Today, environmental factors like bacteria are eroding the metal framework, and it's expected to completely disintegrate by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### The Legacy of Titanic and Future Projects

Despite 110 years passing, fascination with the Titanic remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. In 2012, Australian billionaire Clive Palmer planned to build "Titanic II," an exact replica intended to sail the same route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Originally projected for completion in 2016, the project has faced delays and was not completed by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. It is speculated that a lack of interest stems from the replica's proposed lack of modern amenities like TV or Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

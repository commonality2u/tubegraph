World War II is described as the most devastating war in human history, leaving numerous large cities in ruins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Nearly all geopolitical events and international relations today can be traced back to this conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The war did not stem from a single event, but rather a series of conspiring events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Treaty of Versailles

The story of World War II begins in 1919, the year World War I ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The famous peace treaty signed to conclude WWI was known as the Treaty of Versailles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. According to one perspective, this treaty "thus starting World War II in 1939" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

A crucial component of the treaty was Article 231 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, also known as the War Guilt Clause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This clause stipulated that Germany was solely responsible for all losses incurred during World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. France and Britain, aiming to recover their losses, demanded heavy reparations from Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Consequently, Germany was ordered to pay a fine of $33 billion to other countries, an amount equivalent to approximately $270 billion in present-day money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Germany made the final payment of this fine in 2010, nearly a century after the treaty was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Additionally, the Treaty of Versailles imposed a condition that Germany could not possess any form of military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Immediate Impact on Germany

The financial burden imposed by the Treaty of Versailles directly impacted German citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Following Germany's first payment of the fine in 1921, the country experienced hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The German Mark rapidly devalued, as evidenced by the price of a packet of bread in Berlin: 160 Marks in 1922, escalating to 200 billion Marks by 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This crippled the economy and led to a rapid rise in unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Contribution to the Rise of Hitler and World War II

Amidst these dire circumstances, Adolf Hitler emerged as a political leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. He exploited the widespread distress and manipulated the masses through his speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, claiming that Germany's international humiliation was caused by "anti-national" elements within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, specifically blaming Jews and Socialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Extensive propaganda and hate speeches were disseminated over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The [[formation_and_consequences_of_postwwii_europe | Great Depression]] in 1929 further exacerbated Germany's unemployment situation, with 6 million people jobless by 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. By 1933, Hitler declared himself the Dictator of Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Violations of the Treaty

After consolidating power, Hitler began working towards his dream of a racially pure German Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. In 1935, it became public that Germany had an air force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, which was an open violation of the Treaty of Versailles' prohibition on German military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

However, many in Britain at the time believed the treaty's terms were unfair to Germany, viewing the reparations and military restrictions as excessively demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. In June 1935, Britain even signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, formally recognizing Hitler's authority to form a navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Despite this, France grew alarmed by Germany's increasing militarization and constructed the 450 km long Maginot Line fortification on its Eastern border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Once Hitler believed his military was adequately prepared, he began a series of invasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>:
*   **Austria (1938)**: Hitler sought to unite all German-speaking countries, and with significant support from within Austria, German troops marched into Vienna without bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Austria ceased to be an independent country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Czechoslovakia (1938-1939)**: Hitler claimed the Sudetenland region due to its German population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, seeking to avoid war, signed the Munich Agreement in September 1938, ceding Sudetenland to Germany in exchange for a promise of no further wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Hitler violated this agreement less than a year later, invading the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Poland (1939)**: To facilitate the invasion of Poland, Hitler signed a Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union in 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. On September 1, 1939, German troops invaded Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This led the UK to issue an ultimatum, which Hitler ignored, resulting in the UK officially declaring war on Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. France, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada followed suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

While these declarations marked the official start of hostilities, an initial period known as the Phony War occurred, where no direct military support was provided to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Poland's outdated army was quickly defeated by Germany's Blitzkrieg strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, a revolutionary warfare strategy focused on speed and stealth using tanks and the Luftwaffe (air force) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. By September 8, 1939, German troops occupied Poland, which was then partitioned between Nazi Germany and the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

The events surrounding the Treaty of Versailles set the stage for the rise of Nazi Germany and the outbreak of World War II, illustrating how perceived injustices and economic hardship can be exploited to ignite global conflict.

Shrinkflation is a tactic employed by companies where they do not raise their product prices, but instead reduce the size or quantity of their products over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This often results in customers paying the same amount for less product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Examples of Shrinkflation

This phenomenon is observed across various product categories and industries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. A drastic increase in shrinkflation has been noted since the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Food and Beverages
*   **Onions** In January 2025, on Zepto's Android app, 1 kg of onions was priced at ₹43, while on an iPhone, it was ₹57 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.
*   **Grapes** Similarly, 500 grams of grapes sold for ₹146 on iPhone compared to ₹65 on Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Maggi** The weight of a Maggi packet decreased from 80g to 55g <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Thums Up and Coca-Cola** ₹20 bottles of Thums Up and Coca-Cola shrank from 250ml to 200ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Parle-G** A ₹10 packet of Parle-G biscuits contained 140 gm in 2021, which reduced to 110 gm in 2022. When initially introduced, this packet contained 250 gm of biscuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Big Mac** The size of McDonald's Big Mac in 2004 compared to 2024 has notably decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Lays** A packet of Lays chips often contains only a handful of chips, with most of the packet being air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Haldiram's Aloo Bhujia** A ₹10 packet of Haldiram's Aloo Bhujia, previously 55g, now weighs 42g <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Hajmola** A ₹1 Hajmola packet, which earlier had 6 tablets, now contains only 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Dominos Chicken Wings** In 2022, Dominos reduced the number of chicken wings in their $7.99 order from 10 to 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Household Products
*   **Toilet Paper** The size of toilet paper rolls has also shrunk. Before 2023, Walmart's toilet paper rolls had 168 sheets, which was reduced by 28% to 120 sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Vim Dish Soap** In 2022, within three months, the size of a ₹10 Vim dish soap bar was reduced from 155 grams to 135 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Concealed Shrinkflation
Companies often use innovative ways to reduce product size without immediately alerting customers:
*   **Cadbury Dairy Milk** In 2013, when Cadbury reduced the size of Dairy Milk bars by 10%, they maintained the number of squares but reduced the size of each square and the overall thickness of the chocolate bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Toblerone** In 2016, Toblerone reduced its chocolate weight from 400g to 360g by increasing the space between each chocolate piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Printer Ink Cartridges
Even printer ink cartridges are subject to shrinkflation, with the quantity of ink decreasing over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Cartridges previously sold as 'Standard' are now marketed as 'Extra Large' despite containing less ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. HP faced significant problems in Australia and Europe due to these practices, leading to apologies and compensations to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Impact on Consumers and Environment
The practice of shrinkflation, alongside [[planned_obsolescence_and_consumer_electronics | planned obsolescence]] and [[misleading_marketing_tactics | misleading marketing tactics]], contributes to increased consumption levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This, in turn, necessitates more mining of elements like gold, cobalt, and lithium, and results in higher carbon emissions and e-waste generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

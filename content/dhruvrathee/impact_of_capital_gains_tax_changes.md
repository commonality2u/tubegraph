The presentation of [[budget_2024_overview | Budget 2024]] by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23rd was met with significant public backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Even strong supporters of the government expressed anger, particularly concerning tax issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Comedian Abhijit Ganguly's viral tweet highlighted the sentiment: "If I earn money, Nirmala taxes it. If I spend money, then also Nirmala taxes it. If I don't earn or spend both and my money is just lying in investment, Nirmala taxes that too! And the best part is, if I pay tax, there is an additional cess on it, so Nirmala taxes the tax amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A viral flowchart illustrated the direct tax of 30% on salary, 20% tax on short-term investment returns, 12.5% on slow returns, and GST ranging from 12% to 28% on expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Capital Gains Tax Revisions

Capital Gains Tax is levied when an asset (like a house or land) is sold, or profits are made from investments such as the stock market or mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. It is divided into two categories:
*   **Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG)**: Applies to assets bought and sold within one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG)**: Applies to investments held for more than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

In the new budget, both these taxes have been increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:
*   **STCG** increased by 5%, from 15% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **LTCG** increased by 2.5%, from 10% to 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

However, the exemption limit for capital gains has also been raised from ₹100,000 to ₹125,000, meaning profits below this amount are not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Investors in the stock market and mutual funds are naturally upset by these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on Futures and Options

People engaged in Futures and Options (F&O) trading also face increased taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   **Futures**: Tax increased from 0.0125% to 0.02% of the transaction value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Options**: Tax increased from 0.0625% to 0.1% of the option premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Government's Justification for Tax Hikes

The government's rationale for increasing these taxes may be found in the Economic Survey of 2023-2024, an annual report presented before the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Page 65 of the survey states:
> "If equity market claims on the real economy are excessively high, it is a harbinger of market instability rather than market resilience." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

This implies that the stock market is becoming a "bubble," and excessive growth can lead to instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Previously, the government cited the rising stock market as an indicator of national development, but now they suggest its excessive growth can cause instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The government aims to discourage excessive investment, particularly in risky Futures and Options trading, where many people lose significant life savings due to greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Impact on Non-Financial Assets (Property)

For non-financial assets like property (land, house, apartment), the LTCG tax has been reduced from 20% to 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. However, the government has removed the indexation benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Removal of Indexation Benefit
Indexation adjusts the cost of acquisition for inflation, reducing the taxable capital gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. For example, if a house bought for ₹2 million 20 years ago was valued at ₹6 million today after inflation adjustment, the LTCG tax would be calculated on profits above ₹6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. With indexation removed, the tax will be calculated on the profit against the original ₹2 million cost, without accounting for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

The government's intention behind this change might be to discourage speculation in property prices and prevent a "Real Estate bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. While this might benefit those hoping to afford a first home by stabilizing prices, it negatively impacts lower-middle-class individuals who do not own properties but wish to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The change also impacts those who invested in delayed housing projects over the last 2-3 years, potentially leading to more losses for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Example Calculation
Let's consider a property bought for ₹2 million in 2004 and sold in 2024 for ₹12.4 million (assuming an annual increase of 9.3% based on Centre for Social and Economic Progress studies for 1991-2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The Cost Inflation Index (CII) in 2004 was 113, and in 2024, it is 363 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

*   **Old System (with indexation)**:
    *   Inflation-adjusted cost (₹2 million * (363/113)) = ₹6.42 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
    *   Taxable profit = ₹12.4 million - ₹6.42 million = ₹6 million (approx.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>
    *   LTCG tax at 20% = ₹1.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>

*   **New System (without indexation)**:
    *   Taxable profit = ₹12.4 million - ₹2 million = ₹10.4 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>
    *   LTCG tax at 12.5% = ₹1.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>

In this realistic scenario, the new system results in an approximate loss of ₹100,000 for the taxpayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Concerns have been raised that this might encourage cash dealings and increase black money circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. An exception applies if the property was bought before 2001, in which case indexation benefits are still provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Other Tax Changes

### Angel Tax
The budget proposes to remove Angel Tax, which was levied on startups issuing fresh shares at a higher price than their fair market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This decision has been widely praised, even by opposition parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### Income Tax
Minor changes were introduced in Income Tax, providing negligible benefits to the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>:
*   Standard Deduction increased from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   Tax slabs were adjusted slightly:
    *   Annual income up to ₹700,000 taxed at 5% (previously ₹300,000-₹600,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
    *   ₹700,000-₹1 million taxed at 10% (previously ₹600,000-₹900,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
    *   ₹1 million-₹1.2 million taxed at 15% (previously ₹900,000-₹1.2 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
    Remaining tax rates remained unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

Comparing with previous governments, between 2006 and 2012, tax slabs were frequently increased to benefit the middle class, but these changes have been rare in the last 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## Historical Context and Income Inequality

The LTCG tax itself was at 0% in 2004 when Dr. Manmohan Singh became Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. It was only reintroduced by the Modi government in 2018 and has now been increased to 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

This budget has drawn criticism for its perceived favouritism towards millionaires and billionaires, while squeezing the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This perspective is supported by the government's revenue distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>:
*   19% from Income Tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>
*   18% from GST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>
*   Merely 17% from corporate tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>

Historically, before 2014-15, corporate tax constituted the majority share of government revenue. However, the government has gradually reduced corporate tax over the years, shifting the focus to income tax payers for revenue collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

This contributes to the growing [[income_inequality_and_tax_policy | income inequality]] in the country, where the top 10%'s share of income has consistently increased while the middle class's share has decreased, a situation described as worse than during the British Raj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Critics argue that the government should focus on promoting small businesses and taxing billionaires more instead of burdening the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

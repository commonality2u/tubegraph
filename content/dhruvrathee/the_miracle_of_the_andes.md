On 12th October, 1972, a small chartered aircraft departed from Uruguay, South America, bound for Santiago, Chile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The plane carried 45 passengers, including rugby players, their families, and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The journey, typically three hours, involved crossing the vast [[andes_mountains_plane_crash | Andes Mountains]], the world's longest mountain range after the Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Crash

Due to a storm on October 12th, the pilots made an overnight stop in Mendoza, Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The flight resumed on October 13th at 2:18 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. After a smooth hour, at 3:21 p.m., as the plane began its descent near Santiago, it encountered severe turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Clouds obscured visibility, and alarms sounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. A passenger looking out the window saw they were perilously close to a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The pilots attempted to gain altitude, but it was too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The rear of the aircraft collided with the mountain, causing the entire tail section to separate, and three passengers flew out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Moments later, the left wing broke, and more passengers were lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The front portion of the plane then crashed into a glacier, sliding 700 meters before coming to a halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The cockpit was crushed, and the pilots were killed instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The wreckage lay on an unknown mountain in the Andes at an altitude of 3,570 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Initial Survival and Search Efforts

Surprisingly, 33 out of 45 people survived the initial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Among them were medical students Roberto Canessa (19) and Gustavo Zerbino (20), who immediately began treating the injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Fernando Parrado (23) was in a coma due to a skull fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Within an hour of the plane's disappearance, the Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service launched a search, deploying four aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. However, the white aircraft was difficult to spot against the snow and ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Five injured passengers succumbed to the cold on the first night, reducing the number of survivors to 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The survivors used parts of the plane, luggage, and snow to create a makeshift shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

On October 14th, 11 aircraft from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay joined the search, but still failed to locate the crash site despite being in the correct area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Survivors attempted to signal search planes by writing "SOS" with lipstick on the roof and making a large cross with suitcases, but they went unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Deteriorating Conditions

By October 15th, water became a critical concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. A passenger named Fito Strauch devised a solar collector using a metal sheet to melt snow into water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Seat cushions were used as snowshoes, and wool from seat covers provided warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

On October 16th, Fernando Parrado awoke from his coma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He discovered his mother had died in the crash, and his 19-year-old sister was severely injured; she passed away eight days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Most survivors were from coastal areas and had never experienced snow, enduring -30Â° Celsius temperatures without proper food and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Snow blindness, caused by ultraviolet rays reflecting off the snow, was another threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

On October 21st, eight days after the crash, search and rescue teams officially ceased operations, believing there was no chance of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The search concluded after 142 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Survivors later found a transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Rugby player Roy Harley, an electronics enthusiast, managed to get it working, but it only allowed them to receive messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Eleven days after the crash, they heard the news that the search had been cancelled, crushing their hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Desperate Measures

By the 11th day, food supplies were nearly exhausted, consisting only of a few chocolate bars, a tin of mussels, jam, almonds, peanuts, dates, candies, dried plums, and wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. They had rationed food, with Parrado reportedly eating one chocolate-covered peanut over three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. At 3,800 meters, there were no plants or animals to hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Faced with starvation, the survivors made the harrowing decision to eat the bodies of their deceased friends and family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Roberto Canessa was the first to attempt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Two days later, with no other option, others followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Avalanche and Further Loss

On October 29th, 16 days after the crash, an avalanche struck the plane, burying it in snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Eight more people suffocated, leaving only 19 survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Trapped, Parrado used a metal pole to create a ventilation hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. After two days, they managed to dig a tunnel and emerge to the surface, only to find a snowstorm approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. They spent three more days in the cramped snow cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## The Expedition for Help

Upon realizing no one was coming to save them, the survivors decided to take matters into their own hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. The strongest survivors, Canessa, Parrado, and Vizintin, were given the most food and warmest clothes to trek for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. They incorrectly believed they were only a few kilometers from Chile, estimating a short walk west would lead them to safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. In reality, the crash site was 89 km east, in the middle of the Andes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

On November 15th, 33 days after the crash, the three set out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. They found the rear section of the plane, containing suitcases, chocolates, meat patties, rum, clothes, and importantly, the aircraft's two-way radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Their attempt to use the radio failed due to incompatible electrical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. They then realized they had to keep walking west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

On December 11th, 59 days after the crash, another avalanche killed three more survivors, leaving 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. To survive the cold nights, 18-year-old Carlos Miguel Rodriguez, recalling his mother's sewing lessons, stitched together clothing pieces to create a large sleeping bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

On December 12th, two months after the crash, Parrado, Canessa, and Vizintin began climbing the glacier without any mountaineering gear, maps, or compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. They kept moving, using the shared sleeping bag at night for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. After three days, they realized their estimate of the distance was wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Vizintin returned to the crash site to conserve food, using an aircraft seat as a sleigh, reaching the site in just one hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

Parrado and Canessa continued climbing. After three more hours, they reached the peak, only to see an endless expanse of snowy mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Determined, they spotted two snow-free peaks on the far western horizon and continued in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

## The Discovery and Rescue

After many more days of hiking, they finally reached a valley with a flowing river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. On December 20th, after 9 days of trekking, they saw signs of human presence â cows in fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. On the other side of the river, they spotted three men on horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. Parrado's shouts were unheard over the river, but one man, Sergio Catalan, a Chilean farmer, spotted them and signaled he would return the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

The next day, Catalan returned with paper and pencil, which he threw across the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Parrado wrote a message in Spanish, explaining they were from a plane that crashed in the mountains, had been walking for 10 days, and desperately needed help for their injured friends at the crash site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Catalan, recalling news of a plane crash months prior, realized the incredible truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. He threw bread to them and then rode for 10 hours to the nearest city to inform the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

Parrado and Canessa were brought to Los Maitenes by farmers for rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. They had hiked 61 km over 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Canessa had lost half his body weight, weighing only 44 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Their survival story quickly became international news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

The Chilean Air Force dispatched three helicopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Parrado, who had kept the pilot's flight chart and marked their hiking path, guided army officers to the crash site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. On December 22nd, 1972, 70 days after the crash, two search and rescue helicopters reached the survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

In total, 16 survivors were rescued, suffering from altitude sickness, dehydration, broken bones, and malnutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. All eventually recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. The [[survival_story_of_uruguayan_air_force_flight_571 | survival story of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] is a testament to human hope, resilience, and the power of will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

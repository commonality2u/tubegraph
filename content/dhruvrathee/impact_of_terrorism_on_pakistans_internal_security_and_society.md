Pakistan's history of supporting and sponsoring terrorism on its own soil has made it difficult to trust its government and military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This policy has led to significant consequences for its internal security and the well-being of its society.

## Ceasefire Violations and Lack of Trust
In May, an [[indiapakistan_ceasefire_and_violations | India-Pakistan ceasefire]] was agreed upon on the evening of May 10th, with Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) calling India's DGMO at 3:35 pm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Both sides agreed to stop all firing and military action from land, air, and sea starting at 5:00 pm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, just a few hours after this agreement, [[indiapakistan_ceasefire_and_violations | Pakistan started ceasefire violations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Pakistan's Retaliation Targeting Civilians
After India launched Operation Sindoor, attacking nine terrorist sites in Pakistan in response to the **[[pahalgam_terrorist_attack_details | Pahalgam terrorist attack]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, Pakistan retaliated by shelling civilian villages along the Line of Control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This unprovoked firing and bombardment of Indian civilian houses led to significant casualties in areas like Pooch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. At least 16 people were killed, with 44 out of 59 injured being civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Tragic incidents included the deaths of two children, aged 14 and 12, whose car was hit by a shell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Another instance saw 12-year-old twins killed when a bomb fell on their house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

The video explicitly labels this behavior as a "cowardly attack on civilians, ignoring all international protocols," proving that the Pakistan government and military support terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Internal Terrorism and its Impact
While Pakistan often points outwards, it also faces significant internal threats from terrorist organizations it once supported:
*   **Peshawar School Attack (2014):** At least 132 innocent children lost their lives in a horrific terror attack on a Peshawar school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a terrorist organization from within Pakistan, claimed responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Attacks on Pakistani Military:** The TTP has killed over 80,000 Pakistanis in the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Recent reports show the TTP killed 20 Pakistan Army personnel, and Baloch insurgents killed two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) carried out IED attacks, killing eight soldiers in one incident and ten in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Pakistan's History of Support and Denial
Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif admitted to Sky News that for the last three decades, Pakistan had been doing "dirty work for America, for the West and even for Britain" by backing, supporting, training, and funding terrorist organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. He called this a "mistake" for which Pakistan "suffered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Former Prime Minister Imran Khan also admitted that jihadist outfits had been operating for decades since the US-led Afghan war against the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. However, both denied current support, with Khawaja Asif claiming Lashkar-e-Taiba "does not exist" in Pakistan anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Shashi Tharoor highlighted Pakistan's "master of denial" habit, citing instances like the initial denial of involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai attacks (later admitted) and knowledge of Osama bin Laden (who was found near a Pakistani Army base) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### International Scrutiny: FATF and IMF
The **[[role_of_international_organizations_like_fatf_in_monitoring_pakistan | Financial Action Task Force (FATF)]]**, which monitors global money laundering and terror financing, placed Pakistan on its increased monitoring grey list three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. After Pakistan promised to take action on 34 items related to terrorist financing, it was removed from the grey list in October 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

However, satellite imagery analysis by Intel Labs shows that Jaish-e-Mohammed's base in Bahawalpur doubled in size after Pakistan's removal from the FATF grey list, spreading over 18 acres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This base is used for terrorist recruitment and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Evidence suggests these terror centers operate openly, with one complex located just 8km from a Pakistani military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
A children's magazine by Jaish-e-Mohammed, "Muslim Bacche," was found to be encouraging 600 madrassa children to support jihad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The brother of Masood Azhar, Abdul Rauf, a US-designated terrorist, was seen leading funeral prayers for killed terrorists, with Pakistani military personnel and Pakistan flags on coffins in the background, implying state funerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Questions have also been raised about the IMF approving a $2.3 billion loan package for Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### Terror Financing through Drug Trafficking
Lashkar-e-Taiba is engaged in narco-trafficking as a strategy to weaken India by selling drugs to its youth and using the money for terror activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   In 2021, over 2900 kg of heroin worth â‚¹21,000 crores was seized at Mundra Port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This was routed from Afghanistan, through Iran, and imported to India hidden as tack powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. A witness in this case, a retired customs official, was found dead under mysterious circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   Lashkar-e-Taiba, formed in 1986 during Zia ul Haq's Islamisation process, has been responsible for numerous terror operations, including the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, 2006 Mumbai local train blasts, and played a role in the 26/11 attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Its charity wing, Jamaat Dawa, is considered the same entity by international bodies and has been banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The Pakistani government has allegedly used Lashkar-e-Taiba to implement its agenda in Balochistan and even to fight the Islamic State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

## Societal and Political Instability
Due to these policies, Pakistan has become a highly unsafe country.
*   **Global Peace Index (2024):** Pakistan ranks 1140 out of 1163 countries on the Global Peace Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
*   **Increased Attacks:** The Centre for Research and Security Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank, reported that 2024 was the deadliest year for Pakistan Security Forces in the last 10 years, with 40% more attacks compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Out of 905 incidents, 444 were Islamist terrorist attacks, resulting in 685 soldiers and police officers killed, and 927 civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Economic Hardship:** People are being killed in stampedes while waiting in line for free flour, reminiscent of the "Flower Wars" before the French Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
*   **Political Instability:** No Pakistani Prime Minister has completed their 5-year term; some are shot, overthrown, hanged, exiled, or jailed, as is the case with Imran Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The country's political system is seen as a "joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

## Call to Action for Pakistani Citizens
The video calls upon Pakistani citizens and celebrities to question their government and military regarding why [[Pakistans support of terrorism | Pakistan is becoming a terrorist nation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. It emphasizes the need to end religious fanaticism in politics, which is seen as a tool for misleading the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

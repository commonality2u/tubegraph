The disappearance of [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | D.B. Cooper]], the man who hijacked a Northwest Orient Airlines flight on November 24, 1971, remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries for the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Despite a 45-year investigation that officially closed in 2016, many questions about his identity, fate, and the recovery of the ransom money remain unanswered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

## The Mystery of Survival

Initially, investigators believed there was "no chance" of [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] surviving the jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. The conditions were extremely challenging:
*   **Altitude and Darkness** He jumped from a height of 10,000 feet in pitch darkness at 8 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
*   **Weather and Clothing** It was raining, with heavy black clouds, and he was dressed in a business suit, white shirt, and black pants, which were unsuitable for jumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.
*   **Wind Speed** The estimated wind speed was 320 km per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.
*   **Cold Water** The United States Parachute Association pointed out the extreme cold water temperatures in November in that region, leading to hypothermia within minutes if he landed in a lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.
*   **Weight of Cash** The 10 kilos of cash strapped to him would have made swimming more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

However, subsequent events led the FBI to reconsider the possibility of [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]]'s survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>:
*   **Copycat Hijackings** After [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]]'s widely publicized hijacking, at least five copycat hijackers used similar tactics, and all five survived their jumps, some in worse conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.
    *   Martin McNally hijacked a plane on June 24, 1972, jumping from a plane traveling at 400-500 km per hour (twice [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]]'s estimated speed) and survived using only a reserve parachute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
    *   Richard Lapoint hijacked a plane in January 1972, wearing similar clothes, and landed safely in the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. (Both McNally and Lapoint were later caught by the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>).
*   **Knowledge of Parachutes** When flight attendant Tina Mucklow offered to read instructions for the parachutes, [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] stated he knew how to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

## The Search for Clues

The FBI noted the serial numbers of the $200,000 ransom, which consisted of 10,000 $20 bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. They spread this list across the country, informing banks and casinos to report any matching notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

Initial searches of the pine forests, lakes, and canyons southwest of Washington State yielded no trace of [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]], his body, or the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. The search area was difficult to pinpoint due to many variables, such as wind speed, darkness, exact plane location, and parachute deployment height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. The FBI even conducted an experiment, dropping a 91 kg sled from a Boeing 727 to estimate a landing area, leading to door-to-door searches, patrol boats on lakes, and even a submarine search 200 feet under Lake Merwin, all without success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. A $1,000 reward for finding a note from the serial numbers was offered for three years but went unclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

### Discovery of the Money

In 1980, eight years after the hijacking, an eight-year-old boy found $5,800 in $20 bills, some still bundled with rubber bands, on the bank of the Columbia River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>. The serial numbers confirmed it was the ransom money given to [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. This discovery supported a hypothesis by pilot Tom Bohan, who had been flying four minutes behind [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]]'s aircraft that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. Bohan believed the FBI's initial drop zone calculations were off by 80 degrees and suggested searching near the drainage area of the Washougal River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. The money was found downstream of this river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. Despite renewed searches, no body or parachute pieces were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>. FBI agent Richard Tosaw speculated that [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] likely drowned in the cold river water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>.

## Clues to Identity and Profession

Physical evidence left by [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] included a tie with a clip and some torn parachute parts used to cover the money bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. His personal items, such as cigarettes, were also found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Investigators also found 66 unidentified fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### The Tie Clip Analysis

In March 2009, a research team used electron microscopy to analyze specific microscopic particles found on the golden tie clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. They found unalloyed titanium with traces of aluminum and titanium antimony alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. These findings suggested that [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] likely worked in a chemical or metal manufacturing plant, or an aeronautical engineering company, possibly even Boeing, as unalloyed titanium was used in aircraft fabrication facilities at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

### The Sketches

The FBI created multiple sketches of [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] based on descriptions from passengers and crew:
*   The first sketch (November 28, 1971) was deemed inaccurate by witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.
*   A new sketch (after a year) was also not very accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>.
*   The third and final sketch (January 2, 1973) was considered accurate by a flight attendant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

FBI investigator Larry Carr, who led the team from 2006-2009, theorized that [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] was an aircraft cargo loader in the Air Force, due to their basic jump training, knowledge of parachutes, and understanding of aircraft mechanics, including deploying plane stairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>.

## Key Suspects

Based on these descriptions, the FBI developed a list of over 800 suspects, narrowing it down to 20 serious candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

### Richard McCoy

*   **Background** A Vietnam War veteran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>.
*   **Similar Hijacking** Five months after [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]]'s incident, McCoy hijacked a Boeing 727, demanding $500,000 and four parachutes, then jumped from the rear stairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.
*   **Arrest and Conviction** He was arrested two days later and sentenced to 45 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. The FBI initially believed he was [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.
*   **Theories** A 1991 book, "DB Cooper, The Real McCoy" by former FBI agent Russell Caleme, suggested McCoy was [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>. McCoy's family reportedly believed the tie and tie clip belonged to him, though McCoy himself never admitted or denied being [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.
*   **Death** McCoy was killed during a shootout while attempting a jailbreak after two years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>.
*   **FBI's Current Stance** The FBI no longer officially considers McCoy as [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | DB Cooper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>. This is due to the sketch of [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]] not matching McCoy's description, and evidence placing McCoy in Las Vegas and then at home with his family on the night of [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | Cooper]]'s hijacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>.

### Robert Rackstraw

*   **Background** Another Vietnam War veteran with arrests for fraud, aircraft theft, and explosives, though always found not guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>.
*   **Theories** TV producer Thomas Colbert published "The Last Master Outlaw" in 2016 and created a History Channel documentary, "DB Cooper: Case Closed," asserting that Rackstraw was [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | DB Cooper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:00">[22:58:00]</a>. Colbert and his team, which included former FBI agents, believed Rackstraw was the culprit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>.
*   **Evidence** Rackstraw was initially high on the FBI's suspect list in the 1970s and made joking comments to the media about being the hijacker (though he later denied these claims) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>. His face matched the sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>.
*   **FBI's Stance** The FBI removed Rackstraw from their suspect list after 1979 due to insufficient substantial evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. Colbert argued the FBI should have continued investigating him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>.
*   **Later Life and Death** The FBI officially closed the [[fbi_investigation_and_challenges_in_the_db_cooper_case | case]] on July 12, 2016, the day after Colbert's book launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>. Rackstraw, who was 73 at the time, lost his job due to the allegations and passed away from natural causes in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite extensive investigation, theories, and potential suspects, the identity and ultimate fate of [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | D.B. Cooper]] remain unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>. The [[the_mystery_and_unresolved_questions_about_db_cooper | mystery]] persists, making it the only unsolved airplane hijacking in United States history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

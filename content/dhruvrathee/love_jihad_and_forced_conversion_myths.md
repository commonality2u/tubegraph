From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

"The Kerala Story" is a film that claims a secret plot is underway in Kerala to forcefully convert innocent women to Islam and send them to IS*S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The film and its director allege that this has happened to approximately 32,000 girls, who are now buried in the deserts of Syria and Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This article explores the truth behind these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Propaganda Techniques Employed

The film appears to utilize propaganda techniques described by historical figures like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

*   **The Big Lie**: Hitler's technique involves telling an outrageously large lie to make people believe that no one could make up such a lie, thus leading them to think there must be some truth in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Repetition**: Goebbels emphasized repeating the "Big Lie" multiple times from various sources to increase its believability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Half-Truth**: This technique involves embedding elements of truth within speeches to convince those not swayed by overt lies, as some individuals can easily identify outright fabrications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These three techniques are asserted to have been used to mislead people regarding "The Kerala Story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Film's Claims vs. Factual Records (Half-Truths)

The director of "The Kerala Story," Sudipto Sen, cited several incidents as inspiration for the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. These citations are presented as [[love_jihad_and_forced_conversion_myths | half-truths]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, as they appear convincing at first glance but misrepresent the full context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Oommen Chandy's Statement

*   **Film's Claim**: The film references a 2010 statement by former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in the Kerala Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Reality**: An India Today article from 2012 cited Chandy's report that 2,667 women converted to Islam between 2006 and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, Chandy did not use the term 'forced conversions' and stated that forced conversions and hate campaigns against Muslims for 'Love Jihad' would not be tolerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. He also did not mention these women joining IS*S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### V.S. Achuthanandan's Interview

*   **Film's Claim**: Another former Chief Minister, V.S. Achuthanandan, reportedly said Kerala would become an Islamic state in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Reality**: A circulated video of Achuthanandan's interview from his tenure (2006-2011) was uploaded by Sunshine Pictures, the same company that made "The Kerala Story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The English subtitles of the video were altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Achuthanandan was criticizing PFI for allegedly influencing youth of other religions by paying them to marry Muslim women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. IS*S was not mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, and Kerala remains a safe and secular state 13 years after his statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### The Story of Nimisha/Fathima

*   **Film's Claim**: The film's teaser depicts a girl named Fatima imprisoned in an Afghanistan jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Reality**: A June 2021 article confirms that four women from Kerala, including Nimisha alias Fathima Isa, went to Afghanistan with their husbands to join the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) between 2016 and 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Their husbands were killed in attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. NIA's 2016 list of 20 most wanted Indians in IS*S includes these four women, plus two more, Ajmala and Shamasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   Of these six women, three were already Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   Two converted from Christianity to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Only one converted from Hinduism to Islam: Nimisha Nair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   Nimisha's husband, Eeza (formerly Bexon Vincent), had converted from Christianity to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Both brothers (Eeza and Bestin) and their wives were converts and radicalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   The Indian government recently denied these four women permission to return to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Interviews of Nimisha, Sonia Sebastian, and Reffeala from 2020 on StratNews Global show them as still brainwashed and radicalized, contrasting with the helplessness portrayed in the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## ISIS Recruitment Statistics: The Big Lie

The film's central claim is that 32,000 women from Kerala were sent to IS*S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This figure is contradicted by official reports and international data.

*   **Global Numbers**:
    *   The UN Undersecretary General for Counter Terrorism, Vladimir Voronkov, stated that nearly 40,000 foreign terrorist fighters from 110 countries went to Syria and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   A 2018 study by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization of King's College, London, reported 41,490 people from 80 countries affiliated with IS*S, with 79% being men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Estimates suggest 40,000-42,000 foreign terrorists globally joined IS*S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Indian Numbers**:
    *   The US Bureau of Counter-Terrorism's 2020 report stated that by September 2020, NIA had investigated 34 terrorism cases and arrested 160 IS*S-related individuals in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   An October 2019 Observer Research Foundation (ORF) paper estimated 180-200 pro-IS*S cases in India between 2014 and 2018, including those spreading propaganda, not just those who left India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    *   In 2019, the Indian Home Ministry reported 155 such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   Out of 180-200 total cases, 40 were from Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

*   **Actual Fighters from India**:
    *   A US Department of State report revealed around 66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with IS*S as of November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   The 2018 Strat News Global report cited a similar figure of approximately 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   Out of these, about 13 were women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
    *   Only 6 women were from Kerala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   Of these 6, 3 converted to Islam from other religions (2 Christians, 1 Hindu) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The film's claim of 32,000 women is identified as "The Big Lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The director avoided questions about the source of this number and eventually changed the film's description to state "3" women after the matter reached court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Critique of Exaggeration

The exaggeration of numbers from 3 to 32,000 fundamentally undermines the film's premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. If only three women were involved, these would be individual cases, not evidence of a widespread conspiracy like "Love Jihad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Generalizing individual incidents to defame an entire state, akin to making a film about all Indians urinating on planes based on three isolated incidents, is deemed illogical and defamatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## India's Low ISIS Recruitment Rate

Compared to other countries, India has a remarkably low number of IS*S recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>:

*   **India**: Around 66 victims of IS*S propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Former Soviet Republics**: 7,000 people (2016 data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Russia**: 2,500 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **France**: 1,700 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Germany**: 760 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **UK**: Around 700 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Despite having the world's third-largest Muslim population, India's ratio of IS*S recruits per million people is 0.5, significantly lower than France (18 per million), Belgium (40 per million), and Jordan (315 per million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Reasons for Low Recruitment

Several factors contribute to India's low IS*S recruitment:

*   **Effective Agencies**: Indian agencies like NIA and IB conducted "Operation Pigeon," a de-radicalization program that identified and saved 350 vulnerable Malayali youth from extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Syncretic Culture**: India's "Unity in Diversity" and syncretic culture, where Muslims live harmoniously with Hindus and Christians, leads to rejection of extreme ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. IS*S itself reportedly considered Indian recruits inferior due to India's "soft" and "liberal" version of Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Positive Role of Muslim Clerics**: Darul Uloom Deoband issued a fatwa in March 2009 declaring India as Dar al-Aman (a country where militant Jihad is prohibited) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. In 2015, 70,000 Indian Muslim scholars issued a joint fatwa against IS*S, Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

## The [[love_jihad_and_forced_conversion_myths | Love Jihad]] Conspiracy Theory

The film propagates the "Love Jihad" narrative, asserting forceful religious conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. However, official investigations contradict this:

*   **NIA Investigation**: In 2017, the Kerala government submitted 90 cases to the NIA for investigation into potential [[love_jihad_and_forced_conversion_myths | Love Jihad]] angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The NIA examined 11 of these cases and concluded in 2018 that while PFI facilitated conversions, no case involved forced conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Union Home Ministry**: In 2020, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, G Kishan Reddy, stated to Lok Sabha that no case of [[love_jihad_and_forced_conversion_myths | Love Jihad]] had been reported by any central agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

The concept of [[love_jihad_and_forced_conversion_myths | Love Jihad]] is described as a "Big Lie" disseminated through politicians' speeches, [[whatsapp_and_media_brainwashing_tactics | WhatsApp forwards]], and propaganda news channels, repeated to gain public belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The narrative is also criticized for being anti-women, implying women can be easily manipulated like "cattle" and lack independent thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

### Religious Conversions in India

Data indicates a balanced conversion trend in India:

*   A 2016 news article reported that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad claimed to have converted 750,000 people back to Hinduism in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   An April 2021 report showed that out of 506 people who registered for religious conversion with the Kerala government, 47% converted from Christianity or Islam to Hinduism, demonstrating a balanced movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   A 2021 Pew Research Center survey of over 30,000 people found that 0.7% left Hinduism for other religions, while 0.8% left other religions for Hinduism, indicating minimal net change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

## Political Exploitation and Propaganda

The propagation of these [[love_jihad_and_forced_conversion_myths | big lies]] and conspiracy theories is seen as a "dirty game" for [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | political power]], aiming to provoke Hindus, Muslims, and Christians into conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | Political parties]] benefit from spreading hatred between religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This includes [[whatsapp_and_media_brainwashing_tactics | WhatsApp forwards]], [[claims_of_spreading_hatred_and_misinformation | propaganda media channels]], and now, [[claims_of_spreading_hatred_and_misinformation | propaganda films]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Parallels are drawn to Hitler's era, where propaganda films distorted history and defamed Jews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

In contrast to promoting the film, the [[propaganda_and_misinformation_regarding_bjp | Prime Minister could have highlighted]] genuine, inspirational operations by Indian forces against IS*S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

> [!quote] The Real Kerala Story
> The real "Kerala Story" should be a source of pride, showcasing how few Muslims from India joined IS*S compared to the rest of the world, and highlighting Kerala as a living example of unity in diversity, excelling in education, healthcare, and human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Yet, politicians use fake stories to defame the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

For a factual and unpropagandistic portrayal of IS*S recruitment, viewers are recommended to watch "The Caliphate," a Swedish TV series on Netflix, which depicts the true story of IS*S recruiting young girls in Sweden without spreading lies or defamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

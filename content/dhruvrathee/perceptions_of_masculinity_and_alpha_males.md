The perception and portrayal of masculinity, particularly the concept of the "alpha male," are significantly influenced by a person's environment and media exposure. While positive masculine traits are celebrated, the glorification of [[psychological_theories_and_identity | toxic masculinity]] and regressive views can have detrimental societal impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Roots of Problematic Masculinity

A child deprived of a father's love, whether due to absence or an excessively strict upbringing, may develop [[psychological_impact_of_absent_or_strict_fathers | psychological issues]] that escalate into severe problems in adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Research indicates that a father's absence can diminish a child's self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, while harsh parenting is linked to aggressive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Additionally, a lack of a caring father can contribute to an individual becoming a criminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

These foundational issues can lead to regressive views on gender and relationships.

### Societal Impact and Regressive Thinking

In the aftermath of the 2012 Nirbhaya case, research sought to understand the motivations behind heinous acts. Madhumita Pandey's study of convicted individuals in Tihar jail revealed that while most murderers expressed regret, many convicted rapists showed a complete lack of remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This lack of regret was attributed to highly regressive views about women, reflecting backward thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Studies, including Susan Brownmiller's 1975 book 'Against Our Will, Men, Women, and R*pe,' conclude that r*pe is often driven by a desire to assert power and dominance, rather than sexual desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The primary motives identified are a need to display power, an outlet for anger, and sadistic cruelty, all stemming from a belief in the inferiority of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Influence of Media and Culture on Masculinity

A person's behavior, personality, and [[psychological_theories_and_identity | identity]] are shaped by their surroundings, including parenting, family interactions, school experiences, and importantly, [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | mass media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This includes news, books, radio, TV ads, social media, songs, and movies, all of which subtly influence the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### The "Incremental Change" Argument

The argument that watching violent films doesn't lead to violent behavior, often made by directors like Sandeep Vanga Reddy regarding films like 'Kabir Singh' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, is likened to claiming one unhealthy meal won't cause a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. While one film doesn't instantly transform a person, the cumulative effect of constant exposure to certain themes leads to "small incremental changes" in the psyche over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

#### Case Study: "Munnu's" Environment

Consider a scenario where a young boy ("Munnu") grows up in an environment where his father beats his mother, his sister faces restrictive rules not applicable to him, and he is exposed to media that consistently promotes [[misogyny and objectification in media | objectification of women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This includes:
*   YouTube content featuring YouTubers who objectify women and claim they are incapable of thought or only meant for household chores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   Instagram creators like Andrew Tate, symbols of toxic masculinity and misogyny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   Songs with lyrics that objectify women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. UNICEF and the American Psychological Association highlight how such media contributes to [[societal_attitudes_and_rape_culture | violence against women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   News channels and politicians expressing views that boys are bound to make mistakes or that girls should face restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Television ads that contribute to the [[misogyny and objectification in media | objectification of women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

In such a pervasive environment, films like 'Animal' contribute to a toxic culture.

### The Film 'Animal' and its Portrayal of Masculinity

The film 'Animal' is criticized for its portrayal of masculinity, seen as a "cringefest c@ncer" for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Despite arguments that it's "just a film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, its director, Sandeep Vanga Reddy, has a history of "regressive and misogynistic films" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The film's protagonist, Rannvijay, is depicted as an "alpha male" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a> who commits numerous mass murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a> and exhibits extreme violence towards his wife, including twisting her arm, grabbing her neck, and pointing a gun at her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The director infamously stated that "love is not genuine unless you can hit your partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

Rannvijay's character traits include:
*   Neglecting his own children despite having "daddy issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   Mocking menstruation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   Declaring it a "man's world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   Demanding his lover lick his shoe to prove her love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

The film's failure to depict the protagonist as mentally ill or undergo positive transformation leads to the glorification of [[misogyny and objectification in media | misogyny]] and [[psychological_theories_and_identity | toxic masculinity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This is further exacerbated by the film's poster featuring the hero smoking, implying a promotion of cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### The Allure of Violence in Media

The director's intention to make his next film even more violent than 'Kabir Singh' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> reflects the understanding that "violence sells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. As Aamir Khan noted, directors lacking creative talent in storytelling often rely heavily on violence and s*x to make films successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Psychologically, some individuals are drawn to extreme violence and bloodshed on screen because they feel powerless and repressed in their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. These individuals, suppressed by authority figures, envision themselves as the protagonist, finding satisfaction in the violence directed towards others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

### Contrasting Masculinities

The release of 'Animal' alongside 'Sam Bahadur,' a film about Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, highlights a stark contrast in heroic archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Sam Bahadur, a real-life hero who fought for the country and humanity, preventing genocide, represents an ideal model of masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

In contrast, characters like Kabir Singh and Rannvijay exemplify a lack of self-control, resorting to shouting, beating, and threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. While such characters were once called "Macho Man," a new term, "Alpha Male," has emerged on social media for those who appreciate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

Films like 'Hum Sath Sath Hai,' a heartwarming family drama inspired by the Ramayana, offer positive messages fostering unity and compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Virtues like humility and compassion, exemplified by Lord Ram, represent an ideal model of masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</sup>. Those who reject such models often lack compassion and empathy, behaving more like animals than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

To foster a healthier society, it is important to be selective about the media consumed, as it shapes one's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

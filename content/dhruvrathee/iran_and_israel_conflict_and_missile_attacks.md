On October 1, Israel's sky was illuminated by over 180 ballistic missiles sent by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The order for this strike came directly from Iran's Head of State and Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed that over 90% of the missiles successfully hit their targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. However, Israel contended that most of the missiles were intercepted by its air defense system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Published images showed craters, including a 30-foot-deep one outside the Mossad's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, and targets in southern Israel's Negev desert, home to a large Israeli military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Despite Israel reporting minimal damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed retaliation, stating Iran "made a big mistake tonight. And it will pay for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The conflict, which began with [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Hamas's attack]] last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, has spread to involve several countries and paramilitary groups like [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Hamas]], [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]], and Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Now, Iran is directly involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

While the situation could escalate into a [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | regional war in the Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, calling it World War 3 is considered premature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Previous Attack (April 2024)

Iran's October 1st attack was not its first against Israel this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. On April 13, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles at Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This attack, involving 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 110 ballistic missiles, was larger in terms of machinery deployed than the October incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. It marked the first time in decades that another country directly attacked Israel, with the last instance being Saddam Hussein's Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Iran stated the April attack was retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on Syria's capital, Damascus, around April 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This Israeli strike killed seven Iranian officers, including a top general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Israel claimed the target was a military building, not an embassy, and the deceased officer had links to [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## [[israels_defense_systems_and_their_effectiveness | Israel's Defense Systems]]

During the April attack, Israel received assistance from allies including America, the UK, and Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. America intercepted around 80 drones and 6 ballistic missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, British Royal Air Force Typhoon jets took down several drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, and Israel's F-35 stealth fighter jets tackled 25 out of 30 cruise missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The shortest distance between Iran and Israel is about 1,000 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Iran's drones would take about 2 hours to reach Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, making a solid intelligence system crucial for defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Israel employs a multi-layered air defense system:
*   **Iron Dome:** Most famous, intercepts short-range rockets within a 70 km radius and up to 10 km altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It launches Tamir Missiles, each costing $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **David Sling:** For medium to long-range missiles, protecting up to 15 km altitude within a 300 km radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Its missiles cost $1 million each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Arrow System (Arrow 3):** For long-range and high-altitude threats, with a detection range of 2,400 km and an altitude of 100 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. It can intercept missiles launched from near space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Arrow 3 missiles cost several millions of US dollars each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. During the April attack, an Arrow 3 system successfully intercepted a ballistic missile outside Earth's atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Despite their capabilities, these systems are expensive to operate. In the April attack alone, Israel spent around $200 million in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This financial strain and limited missile supply mean that too many incoming ballistic missiles could overwhelm Israel's defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Iran's Missile Capabilities

After the October attacks, Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani described the strikes as a "limited act of self-defence" and suggested Western countries should praise Iran for not doing more devastating damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Iran's arsenal includes state-of-the-art missiles:
*   **Fatah missiles (2023):** Used for the first time in the October attack, classified as Hypersonic Ballistic Missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. They can fly at 18,000 km/hour, 15 times the speed of sound, reaching Israel from Iran in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Iran claims there is "no system that can rival or counter this missile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Shahab-3:** Longest-range missiles, with a range of over 2,000 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Unlike small rockets launched by groups like [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Hamas]], ballistic missiles are large, precise, and can even exit and re-enter Earth's atmosphere to hit their target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Escalation of Conflict and Regional Players

The [[israel_palestine_conflict_history | war between Israel and Palestine]] intensified after [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Hamas attacked Israel]] on October 7, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. In retaliation, Israel invaded Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, leading to widespread destruction and over 41,431 Palestinian deaths, with more than half being children and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

The conflict has drawn in [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Iran's proxies]]:
*   **[[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]] (South Lebanon):** Considered one of the most heavily armed non-state groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Formed in 1982 when Israel invaded Lebanon, becoming official in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Its manifesto includes eradicating Western powers from Lebanon and destroying the Israeli state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Most Western countries consider it a terrorist organization, though India does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]] pushed Israel out of Lebanon in 2000 after 22 years of occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. It officially declared war on Israel on October 8, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
    *   Since the war began, over 80,000 Israelis near the border have been displaced due to daily rocket fires from [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Houthis (Yemen):** Founded in the 1990s due to Shia marginalization and increasing foreign influence in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Many countries consider them a terrorist organization; India does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Funded by Iran and reportedly Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
    *   Houthis have disrupted the Red Sea by attacking passing ships, causing nearly $1 trillion in trade losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

These groups, along with [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Hamas]], are part of what is known as the "Axis of Resistance," funded and supported by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Recent Assassinations and Attacks
Prior to the October 1st missile attack by Iran, a series of high-profile assassinations targeting Iranian-backed figures occurred:
*   **July 31:** Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Hamas]], was assassinated in Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. While no one claimed responsibility, Israel is suspected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **September 17:** A "Pager attack" targeted [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]] operatives, causing many casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **September 20:** Ibrahim Akil, commander of [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]]'s Special Operations Forces Unit, was assassinated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **September 25:** [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]]'s missile unit leader was assassinated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **September 27:** IRGC's Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan and [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]]'s top leader Hassan Nasrallah were killed in an Israeli airstrike on [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]]'s main headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
    *   In the last week of September, around 1,000 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

These events led Iran to issue official statements vowing retaliation if its interests or personnel were attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. The October 1st attack was directly linked to the assassination of [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Hezbollah]]'s leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## International Reactions

The United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting after the April attack, with the Secretary-General urging de-escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The UN and USA have continuously condemned the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

The Indian government has not unequivocally condemned Iran's attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, instead expressing deep concern about the escalation in West Asia and urging dialogue and diplomacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. India's Foreign Minister Jai Shankar acknowledged Israel's need to respond but emphasized adherence to international humanitarian laws and protection of civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

The conflict continues to be a series of retaliations, primarily harming innocent civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. As Mahatma Gandhi stated, "An eye for an eye ends up making the whole world blind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

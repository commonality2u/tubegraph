The Supreme Court played a crucial role in the unearthing and declaration of the [[Electoral Bonds Scheme in India | Electoral Bonds Scheme]] as unconstitutional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Supreme Court's Ruling and Declarations
After seven years since its introduction, the Supreme Court declared the [[Electoral Bonds Scheme in India | Electoral Bonds Scheme]] unconstitutional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This decision led to the gradual revelation of various scams that occurred during the scheme's operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

The Supreme Court's decision was based on a petition filed by the CPI(M) political party and NGOs Common Cause and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), with Advocate Prashant Bhushan arguing on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

Two key points were highlighted by the Supreme Court in its ruling:
*   **Right to Information:** Citizens have the right to know the amount and source of donations given to political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. The [[Electoral Bonds Scheme in India | Electoral Bond Scheme]] was found to violate this right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   **Concerns about Kickbacks:** The Court expressed concern about the scheme being used to obtain kickbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>, classifying these contributions as "purely business transactions" where companies donated to gain benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

## Directives to SBI and Data Disclosure
Following its declaration, the Supreme Court directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to release data related to the [[Electoral Bonds Scheme in India | Electoral Bonds Scheme]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

Initially, SBI offered excuses, claiming it would take three months to collate the data and that it could only be disclosed after the elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. However, the Court refused leniency, and the data was subsequently released within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. This data was published on the website of the Election Commission of India (ECI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

The data provided by SBI initially came in two lists:
1.  Companies and individuals who purchased electoral bonds, along with their values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.
2.  Political parties that encashed the bonds and the amounts they received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

However, SBI did not reveal the secret alphanumeric numbers unique to each bond, which prevented the exact connection between donors and recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. This attempt to hide information led the Supreme Court to rebuke SBI again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. The Court then directed SBI to publish the full data by March 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

## Inception of Political Interest
The speaker's interest in politics began in December 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. This interest was sparked by the nationwide protests against corruption, initiated by [[activism_and_raising_political_awareness_through_social_media | Anna Hazare]], [[comparison_of_political_leaders_and_their_backgrounds | Arvind Kejriwal]], and other [[activism_and_raising_political_awareness_through_social_media | social activists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. During this period, the media provided extensive positive coverage of these protests, which is described as something "impossible to imagine nowadays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

Before 2011, the speaker had "zero interest" in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. There was no family connection to politics; traditionally, professions in agriculture or the armed forces were common in their Haryanvi family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

> "Friends, in my family, relatives, even among the far-flung relatives, there's not a single person that has any connection to politics. Zero political connection." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>

This point is highlighted to counter [[accusations_of_political_affiliations_and_bias | misinformation]] suggesting political affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

## Developing Political Views
The speaker's interest in politics deepened after 2012-2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Key events that contributed to this development include:
*   The formation of the first AAP government in Delhi, particularly [[comparison_of_political_leaders_and_their_backgrounds | Arvind Kejriwal]]'s 49-day government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   [[comparison_of_political_leaders_and_their_backgrounds | Narendra Modi]] becoming the new Prime Minister in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

Like many others, the speaker was pleased to see the Congress government lose power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Their initial [[personal_philosophies_and_influence_of_media | political ideology]] was "100% anti-congress," influenced by the [[personal_philosophies_and_influence_of_media | narrative set by the media]] and TV channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. They believed in promises such as the return of black money within 100 days and the end of corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

## Impact of Media and Misinformation
The speaker later realized the extent to which the [[impact_of_political_influence_on_media | media could fall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. Within a few months, they became aware of political "misdirections," observing that:
*   Black money was not going to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
*   RTI was to be diluted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   Foreign funding for political parties was legalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.
*   Corruption increased on a larger scale but was hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.
*   The media was bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

This realization, fueled by frustration from witnessing these events, led the speaker to publish their initial videos on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

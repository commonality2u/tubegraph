The river Ganga is highly revered in Hinduism, with numerous pilgrimage sites located along its banks, including Gangotri, Rishikesh, Haridwar, Banaras, and Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad), where it meets the Yamuna River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Millions consider it "Ganga Maiya" (Mother Ganga) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Despite its sacred status, concerns have been raised about the [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | pollution]] levels in the river, particularly during events like the Mahakumbh, which attracts millions of devotees for a holy dip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Unsafe Water Quality

Government data, specifically from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, has indicated that the water at the Sangam (confluence of Ganga and Yamuna) is not safe for bathing, let alone drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Measuring Water Quality

Water safety is typically measured using two key indicators:

*   **Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)**: This measures the oxygen required by aerobic microorganisms to break down organic matter in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. High BOD levels indicate a significant amount of organic material like sewage, waste, or decaying plant matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   Ideally, drinkable water should have a BOD of 0 mg/litre, or at most lower than 1 mg/litre according to CPCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   For safe bathing, BOD should be lower than 3 mg/litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Faecal Coliform Bacteria (FCB)**: These bacteria are found in human and animal faeces and are a strong indicator of water quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
    *   A 2004 committee set by the Ministry of Urban Development stated that the desirable FCB level is 500 Most Probable Number (MPN) per 100 ml, with a maximum acceptable level of 2,500 MPN per 100 ml for bathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   The World Health Organization (WHO) has stricter standards, recommending 0 MPN per 100 ml for drinkable water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Mahakumbh Water Quality Data

During the Mahakumbh, CPCB data revealed concerning levels of [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | pollution]]:

*   **BOD Levels:**
    *   On January 13, 2025 (start of Mahakumbh), BOD at Sangam was 3.94 mg/litre, exceeding the safe limit of 3 mg/litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   By January 16, it reached 5.09 mg/litre at Sangam, almost twice the limit <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Faecal Coliform Bacteria (FCB) Levels:**
    *   A CPCB report to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) stated that FCB levels exceeded maximum limits at all monitored Mahakumbh locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   On January 20, FCB at Sangam was 49,000 MPN per 100 ml, significantly higher than the 2,500 MPN safe limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   The Yamuna River, before the Sangam, contained 33,000 MPN per 100 ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
    *   On February 4, FCB was 11,000 MPN at Shastri Pool on the Ganga and 7,900 MPN at Sangam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   Major sources of FCB were sewage drains like Jondhwal (9.2 million MPN per 100 ml) and Rajapur and Salori drains (over 3.4 million MPN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   The CPCB explicitly stated that the river was not suitable for bathing at monitored locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

During the Mahakumbh, the government reportedly released freshwater multiple times into the river to dilute the [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | pollution]] and temporarily hide pollutants, rather than cleaning the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Government Denials and Misinformation

Despite damning reports from its own agencies, the government has been accused of attempting to conceal the truth about [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | Ganga's pollution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Contradictory Reports and Criticism

*   The National Green Tribunal (NGT) questioned Uttar Pradesh's Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) about water safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   UPPCB initially claimed the water was suitable for bathing (except at one bridge) but provided old water samples from January 12 (before Mahakumbh) as evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Their 250-page report lacked information on faecal coliform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   On February 20, NGT criticized UPPCB for wasting its time with outdated data and accused them of using unscientific methods and giving incorrect reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   The Allahabad High Court also questioned UPPCB in 2022 regarding discrepancies in their water quality checks compared to samples taken by IIT Varanasi and Banaras Hindu University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Adityanath claimed that the water at the Sangam was fit for both drinking and bathing, overlooking the presence of faecal bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Fabricated Research Claims

To counter negative reports, the government promoted an unverified report by a "scientist" named Dr. Ajay Sonkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   Sonkar's report claimed "no bacterial growth" in water samples from 5 ghats, including the Sangam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   It asserted the [[selfpurification_properties_of_the_ganga | self-purifying properties of the Ganga]] and the presence of 1,100 types of bacteriophages (viruses that kill harmful bacteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   While the Ganga does have some natural [[selfpurification_properties_of_the_ganga | self-cleaning properties]] and bacteriophages are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, a 2020 research study indicated that the current [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | pollution]] load has become too high for these natural properties to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   Dr. Sonkar's "research" was not published in any journal, and its data was not mentioned in news reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Scientific research typically undergoes a 3-6 month peer-review process before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   A 2023 paper by IIT Delhi researchers, based on 16 water samples from Gomukh and other locations, found a large number of disease-causing bacteria, concluding that bacteriophages cannot kill all harmful microbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   The chronology suggests the government promoted Sonkar's unverified research to save face, with the UP government issuing a press release on February 21, followed by its promotion by BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya on February 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   The government's action in refuting its own agencies' data and promoting unverified research indicates [[government_regulatory_failures | regulatory failures]] and an attempt to mislead people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## Impact on Public Health

Bathing in highly [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | polluted water]] can lead to severe [[impact_of_polluted_water_on_public_health | public health]] issues, including skin diseases, gastrointestinal infections, and other health problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. High faecal coliform content can cause diseases like cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

*   A 2022 CPCB report stated that approximately 70% of waterborne diseases in India are caused by river water [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | pollution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Following the Mahakumbh, a senior consultant at Delhi's Indraprastha Apollo Hospital reported that people returning from the Kumbh were experiencing medical problems, including diarrhoea, vomiting, and fevers of unknown origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Breathing problems were also common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Anecdotal evidence of individuals not falling sick after bathing in the water does not negate the factual risks and cannot be used to deny the dangers of [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | pollution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## The Namami Ganga Project

In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke emotionally about Mother Ganga calling for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Ten years ago, the government launched the "Namami Ganga Project" to clean the river.

*   By 2023, ₹330 billion was spent, and by 2024, this amount exceeded ₹400 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   However, the water is still not clean enough for bathing, raising questions about the project's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   The government has repeatedly postponed deadlines for cleaning the river, from 2020 to 2022, and now targeting 2026, with little expectation of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This highlights significant [[government_regulatory_failures | government regulatory failures]].
*   The core issue is the government's unwillingness to acknowledge the problem's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   The source of [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | pollution]] includes sewage and industrial waste flowing into the Ganga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Stopping pollutants from factories is crucial, but this is often neglected due to political donations from companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Other River Cleaning Efforts

Claims of cleaning other rivers, such as the Sabarmati in Gujarat, are also misleading. While the Sabarmati riverfront has been beautified over a few kilometers, the river itself remains highly [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | polluted]], ranking as the second most [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | polluted river]] in the country in 2023, with a BOD level as high as 345 mg/litre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Activism and Government Response

GD Agarwal, a former IIT Kanpur professor who became Swami Gyan Swaroop Sanand, dedicated his life to the Ganga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. His efforts led to Ganga being recognized as a National River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. In 2018, at 86, he undertook a 111-day hunger strike to save the Ganga, writing multiple letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. However, the government remained silent. After his death, the Prime Minister merely tweeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This suggests a pattern of disregard for genuine activists while embracing other figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

As of recent data, Ganga's water is still suitable for bathing and drinking only in Rishikesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. The situation between Haridwar and Kanpur is fair, but after Kanpur, [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | pollution]] exceeds all permissible limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

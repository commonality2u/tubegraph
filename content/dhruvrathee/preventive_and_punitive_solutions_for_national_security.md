The concept of national security is intrinsically linked with peace and prosperity, forming the bedrock upon which any nation can thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Prosperity is unattainable without peace, which encompasses various forms of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. A leader's primary goal should be to ensure safety and security for all citizens, recognizing that every life is precious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This requires a comprehensive approach, combining both preventive and punitive solutions.

## The Importance of Problem Diagnosis

The initial step in addressing any national security issue is to accurately diagnose the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. Just as a doctor identifies an illness before prescribing medicine, a government must understand the root causes of insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. Ignoring or sweeping problems under the carpet, as many politicians are accused of doing, hinders effective governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Transparency in reporting issues, even negative ones, is crucial for finding solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

> "If they are scared of someone, they shouldn't be in this field. In a democracy, if the media isn't strong, the democracy will not work. No country wants a scared media. A media that runs away from important issues. We need a strong media, who can hold their stand even when opposing politicians. We need media like this. Don't talk about a scared media. If they are scared, I will protect them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>

Once a problem is diagnosed and accepted, finding a solution becomes much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

## Categories of Solutions

Solutions to national security challenges can be broadly categorized into two types:

### 1. Preventive Solutions

These measures aim to stop problems before they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

*   **Effective Foreign Policy and Border Security**: Building good relations with neighboring countries can prevent border clashes and infiltration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[00:12:57]</a>. While friends can be chosen, neighbors cannot, making diplomatic engagement essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Defense Forces**: In cases where diplomacy fails, a country must be prepared to counter any attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[00:13:21]</a>. This includes providing the Indian Armed Forces with all necessary equipment (guns, ammunition, protective gear, night vision goggles, naval ships, aircraft, radar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[00:13:25]</a>. Equipment should be readily available, whether through purchase or internal manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Increased Defense Research and Development (R&D)**: Boosting the budget for defense research helps foster self-reliance and technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Regular Military Inspections**: Ensuring that equipment is well-maintained and functioning correctly is vital to prevent casualties from malfunctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Mental Health for Soldiers**: An often-overlooked aspect, addressing the mental health of armed forces personnel is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[00:14:09]</a>. In the last five years, 819 armed forces personnel died by suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[00:14:16]</a>. To combat this, approximately 1,800 mental health practitioners (clinical psychiatrists, behavioral health specialists, licensed clinical social workers) would be hired for the Indian Army, based on the US Army's ratio of 1 practitioner per 700 soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[00:14:30]</a>. This initiative would then be expanded to paramilitary forces, intelligence agencies, and police across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Increased Education Budget**: To address the demand for skilled professionals, especially in mental health, a significant increase in the education budget (3 to 4 times) is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[00:15:54]</a>. This can be funded by:
    *   **Increasing Corporate Tax**: Reverting corporate tax rates to 2017-18 levels could generate an additional ₹1 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[00:16:07]</a>.
    *   **Budget Reallocation**: Diverting funds from excessive highway construction (nearly ₹2 trillion spent annually) to education, given that only 8% of Indian families own cars, and 50% use cycles, bikes, or scooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[00:16:24]</a>. The focus should shift to creating cities for humans, not just cars, to reduce pollution and mitigate urban heat island effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Ending Corruption**: Corruption, especially in areas related to safety and security, must be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[00:17:13]</a>. It contributes to fatal incidents like collapsing illegal hoardings (e.g., Mumbai, 16 deaths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[00:17:20]</a>, dangerous infrastructure (e.g., Morbi Bridge Collapse, 135 deaths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, and unsafe products like adulterated medicines (e.g., Jammu, 12 child deaths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[00:17:31]</a>. The three main reasons for corruption are:
        *   **Top-down Approach**: Corruption often originates from the highest levels of government, forming a chain that needs to be broken by leaders with pure intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[00:17:40]</a>.
        *   **Underpaid and Overworked Officials**: Police officers and government employees often work excessive hours (e.g., 12 hours straight for police) without proper compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[00:18:20]</a>. Increasing their numbers (e.g., doubling police personnel) and ensuring fair pay and benefits (good salary, mental health care, insurance, family benefits) can mitigate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[00:18:42]</a>. Similarly, overburdened courts and judges need increased staffing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[00:18:45]</a>.
        *   **Greed**: While less significant, this is addressed through strict laws and harsh punishments once the first two reasons are tackled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[00:18:59]</a>.
*   **Police Reforms**: To counter the public perception that state police cannot investigate properly (leading to demands for CBI transfers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[00:19:23]</a>, states should establish their own CBI-type investigative agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[00:19:40]</a>. Police officers should be trained to address citizens with respect ("Sir" or "Ma'am") regardless of their socio-economic status, fostering a change in mindset and mutual respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[00:20:26]</a>. Strict 8-hour work limits should be implemented to ensure officer well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Gender Sensitization**: To combat crimes rooted in problematic mindsets (e.g., objectification of women), gender sensitization classes should be introduced in schools from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[00:20:47]</a>. Leaders should also encourage media and entertainment industries to remove misogyny and promote positive content, while upholding freedom of expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[00:21:10]</a>.
*   **Illegal Weapons Amnesty**: Inspired by countries like Australia and Serbia, an amnesty period would be established for citizens to hand over illegal weapons without facing legal repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[00:21:35]</a>. Serbia collected over 1 million illegal weapons within a month through such a program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[00:21:55]</a>.

### 2. Punitive Solutions

These measures involve fighting against existing problems and punishing perpetrators to deter future offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[00:12:41]</a>.

*   **Accountability for Police**: If a local police station refuses to file an FIR, citizens should have the facility to file it at the SP's office, coupled with a departmental inquiry into why the initial FIR was denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[00:11:51]</a>. This approach was successfully implemented in Rajasthan in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Strict Laws and Harsh Punishments**: Implementing strict laws and severe punishments for those engaging in corruption or other crimes is crucial to deter others from similar actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[00:19:08]</a>.

## Vision for India

By implementing these preventive and punitive solutions, the aim is to create an India that is safe and secure for every Indian citizen and every foreigner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[00:22:04]</a>. While these solutions may seem impractical, they are based on tried-and-tested methods, as seen in the transformation of Singapore from a struggling nation in the 1960s to ranking 5th in the Global Peace Index 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to elevate India to become the world's most peaceful and prosperous country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>.

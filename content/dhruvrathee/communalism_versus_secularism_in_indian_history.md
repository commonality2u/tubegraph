From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

The political discourse in India, particularly during elections, often involves politicians invoking historical figures like Aurangzeb and the Mughals. Prime Minister Modi, for instance, has accused the Congress of forgetting Aurangzeb's atrocities, claiming he "destroyed hundreds of Hindu temples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Such statements are described as intentional talking points, part of a "brainwashing mafia's" agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The "Enslaved Hindus" Narrative and its Debunking

A central part of this agenda is to propagate the idea that Hindu ancestors were enslaved by Muslims for thousands of years, painting Hindus as victims oppressed by Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This narrative seeks to make people feel that Hindus have been downtrodden politically, socially, and culturally for millennia, only gaining "real confidence" after 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This claim is easily debunked by historical figures such as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who was a great emperor, not someone's slave or oppressed by a Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The ability of some to simultaneously believe that Hindus were oppressed for thousands of years and that Shivaji was a great emperor who ensured Hindu freedom is likened to George Orwell's concept of "Double Think" from his novel *1984*, where contradictory ideas are accepted simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This narrative often portrays Shivaji as leading an army of Hindus against Aurangzeb's Muslim army, ignoring historical complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Historians like Romila Thapar and Irfan Habib are criticized by proponents of this narrative for their views on Hindu history, specifically for stating that Hindus were not slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj: A Symbol of Religious Harmony

Contrary to the communal narrative, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj demonstrated significant secularism. His father, Shahaji, and uncle, Sharifji (named after a Sufi saint), respected both Hindu and Muslim saints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Shivaji himself often visited Sufi saint Yakut Baba for blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He always favored religious freedom, ordaining that "everybody is free to follow his religion, and nobody is allowed to disturb it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Proper arrangements were made for people to offer prayers as they chose, including piers and mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Under Shivaji's reign, his soldiers were strictly forbidden from harming women, the Qur'an, or mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Notably, when his army captured the daughter-in-law of a Muslim governor, Shivaji sought her forgiveness and sent her back respectfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This act stands in contrast to the views of figures like Savarkar, who advocated for molesting women as a weapon in war and criticized Shivaji for his respectful treatment of the Muslim woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Shivaji's army included many Muslims and Muslim generals. For instance, 500-700 Pathans from the Vijapur Army joined him in 1648 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. His infantry chief was Noor Khan Beg, a Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, and his lieutenant was Shama Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. His top navy chiefs were Daulat Khan and Darya Sarang, and his artillery was commanded by Siddi Hilal and Ibrahim Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. His secretary of intelligence, Maulana Haider Ali, was also Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The famous painting of Shivaji killing Afzal Khan, often circulated to show a "Hindu killing a Muslim," omits details like Afzal Khan's Hindu Brahmin advisor, Krishnamurti Bhaskar Kulkarni, and Shivaji's Muslim bodyguard, Rustam-e-zaman, who advised him to carry an iron claw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This highlights the complex interfaith relations of the era, which ran contrary to the simplistic "Hindu vs. Muslim" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Aurangzeb: A Nuanced Historical Perspective

Aurangzeb is often portrayed as a "Muslim fanatic oppressing Hindus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. It is true that during his rule, many Hindu temples were demolished, and the policy of religious coexistence, prominent during Akbar's rule, gradually phased out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. He increased customs duty on Hindu traders to double that of Muslim traders, and later abolished it for Muslims entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Historical texts like Saqi Mustaid Khan's *Maasir-i-Alamgiri* mention Aurangzeb's orders to demolish Hindu temples to establish Islam "properly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Historians like Irfan Habib and Audrey Truschke confirm that Aurangzeb demolished temples in Mathura and Varanasi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

However, Aurangzeb's actions were not consistently communal.He sent princely orders to Hindu Rajput kings like Rana Raj Singh of Mewar, stating that great kings should ensure peace and prosperity for subjects of every religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. He criticized rulers who committed bigotry by destroying places of worship and vowed to stop such "unIslamic practices" upon ascending to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. In 1659, he ordered officials in Banaras not to disturb or harm Brahmins or Hindus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Aurangzeb also showed patronage to Hindu institutions. In 1687, he ordered the construction of homes for pious Brahmins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. In the 1680s, he engaged in religious discussions with Hindu saints and showered them with gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. In 1691, he gave tax-free land and eight villages to support a Balaji temple in Chitrakoot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. He also gave lands or encouraged temple construction at various places like Allahabad, Vrindavan, and Bihar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. This policy extended to Jains, with land grants in Shatrunjaya, Girnar, and Mount Abu in the late 1650s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Aurangzeb's administration also had significant Hindu participation. His chief diwan was Raja Raghunath Ray, a Hindu, whom Aurangzeb considered the "greatest administrator he had ever known" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Hindu participation in elite levels of the Mughal administration increased by 50% under his rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, with 31.6% of the Mughal nobility being Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The number of Rajput mansabdars (around 72) and Maratha mansabdars (96) under Aurangzeb was substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Modern Parallels: Narendra Modi and Aurangzeb

Eminent historian Harbans Mukhia has called Narendra Modi a "modern parallel of Aurangzeb" due to several similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Both were born in Gujarat (Modi in Vadnagar, Aurangzeb in Dahod) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Both projected themselves as holy persons, with Modi claiming to have lived as a fakir and Aurangzeb said to have earned a living by transcribing the Qur'an and stitching caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Most significantly, both were power-hungry and acted communally or secularly depending on the situation and their political greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Examples of "Secular Modi" include praising Islam for its message of peace, advocating for Muslim youth to hold the Qur'an in one hand and a computer in the other, assuring conservation of mosques, advising BJP workers against anti-Muslim remarks, and sharing Eid and Moharram greetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

Conversely, "Communal Modi" is evidenced by his remarks during CAA-NRC protests about identifying protestors by their clothes, the lynchings under his leadership, the honoring of Bilkis Bano convicts with flowers and calling them "Brahmins with great values," and his recent speeches filled with dog-whistling against Muslims, accusing the opposition of a "Mughal mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. He also follows Twitter accounts that spread hatred against Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Akbar and Maharana Pratap: Challenging the "Hindu-Muslim Rivalry"

The narrative of "Hindu versus Muslim" is also applied to figures like Akbar and Maharana Pratap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. However, historical facts contradict this. In the Battle of Haldighati, Muslim warrior Hakim Khan Sur fought bravely alongside Maharana Pratap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. On the other hand, Akbar had Hindu generals like Raja Man Singh and many Rajput soldiers in his army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The Vishwanath temple, demolished by Aurangzeb, was actually built during Akbar's rule under the supervision of Raja Man Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

Prime Minister Modi's own G20 book, *Bharat the Mother of Democracy*, acknowledges Emperor Akbar's practice of a kind of democracy where all religions were treated equally, introducing the doctrine of "Sulh-i-Kul" (Peace For All) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Four of Akbar's "Nine Gems" were Hindus: Raja Todar Mal, Raja Man Singh, Raja Birbal, and Tansen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Hindu epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata were translated into Persian during Akbar's reign, and Saint Tulsidas wrote Ramcharitmanas during this period, with Ram Leela beginning under his rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh translated 52 Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita into Persian, believing the Upanishads to be humanity's first monotheistic text, influencing global study of Indian religious and cultural texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Even the BJP-led NDMC renamed Dalhousie Road to Dara Shikoh Road in 2017, and Modi's Ministry of Culture sought to locate his grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

## Other Secular Muslim Rulers and the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb

Beyond the prominent Mughals, other Muslim rulers also demonstrated secularism. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal ruler, celebrated Hindu festivals like Dussehra and Diwali alongside Eid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. He united with Hindu and other leaders to fight British colonialism during the 1857 Revolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. Modern leaders like PM Modi have paid tribute to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

Awadh's last king, Wajid Ali Shah, introduced "Adaab" as a secular salutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. Kashmir's Zainul Abidin abolished the Jizya tax, prohibited cow slaughter, and patronized Sanskrit language and literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

Historical evidence indicates that common Hindus and Muslims coexisted happily throughout history, fostering cordial relations known as the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. They respected each other's saints, celebrated festivals together, and contributed to flourishing art forms like paintings and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. In contemporary times, Muslims participate in Ram Leela, dress up as Radha or Krishna for Janmashtami, and contribute to Hindu devotional music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Conversely, Hindus organize Iftar parties for Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

While [[communal_violence_and_false_flag_operations_in_india | communal violence]] has occurred, often instigated by "hateful opportunists" seeking to create divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>, Hindus and Muslims have generally shared their history together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. The notion of [[religious_and_castebased_tensions_in_india | Hindu-Muslim rivalry]] or oppression is largely fabricated to promote hatred and division for political gain, echoing a "divide-and-rule" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. This propaganda disrespects figures like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Maharana Pratap, and Hindu saints who were confident and embraced tolerance, despite claims that Hindus have lived oppressed lives for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

Overall, the historical narrative of India is complex, marked by both periods of conflict and extensive periods of [[impact_of_communal_tensions_on_indian_independence_process | interfaith cooperation]] and coexistence, challenging the simplistic communal portrayals often promoted for [[political_exploitation_of_religious_tensions_in_india | political gain]] and spread through channels like [[significance_of_social_media_in_promoting_communal_narratives | social media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

The global community has undertaken significant efforts to combat the threat of [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]], particularly after a dramatic increase in incidents that severely impacted global shipping and the economy. While initial attempts at self-defense by commercial vessels were limited, a coordinated international response, coupled with enhanced ship security measures, drastically reduced successful hijackings for several years.

## Initial Responses and Shipboard Defenses
Early defensive measures by ships included increasing speed to outrun pirate skiffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, though this was only effective if pirates were far away, as pirate speedboats could easily exceed the large ships' maximum speed of 18-20 knots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Ships also used water hoses to prevent pirates from climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, though this proved largely ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Crew members would sometimes try to rock the ship to capsize pirate boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, or hide in safe rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a> and even attempt to subdue pirates directly, as seen when Chief Engineer Mike Perry attacked and locked up a pirate leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

The incident involving the Maersk Alabama and Captain Richard Phillips in April 2009 garnered significant international attention, marking the first time an American ship was hijacked and its captain kidnapped by [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This incident, later portrayed in the 2013 film *Captain Phillips*, highlighted the severity of the piracy problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. During this event, the USS Bainbridge and other US Navy ships pursued the pirates, negotiating with them while employing tactics like trying to deplete the lifeboat's fuel and using helicopters to block their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="024:45:00">[024:45:00]</a>. Ultimately, US Navy snipers intervened, killing three pirates and rescuing Captain Phillips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="025:38:00">[025:38:00]</a>.

## International Naval Missions
In 2009, the United States, alongside other countries, launched the international naval mission **Task Force 151** to control [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="026:21:00">[026:21:00]</a>. Similarly, the European Union and NATO initiated their own counter-piracy missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="026:30:00">[026:30:00]</a>. Countries like China, Russia, and India also began deploying their warships to the region to address the pirate threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="026:34:00">[026:34:00]</a>. By 2017 to 2023, approximately 20 warships from 14 countries were patrolling these waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="028:01:00">[028:01:00]</a>.

## Enhanced Ship Security
One of the most impactful measures against [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]] was the deployment of armed security guards on commercial vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="026:48:00">[026:48:00]</a>. These guards could easily target pirate speedboats' engines and deter or neutralize pirates before they boarded a ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="027:02:00">[027:02:00]</a>. This tactic proved highly successful, with no commercial vessel carrying armed guards having been successfully hijacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="027:09:00">[027:09:00]</a>.

Other security enhancements for commercial ships included:
*   Increased vessel speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="027:16:00">[027:16:00]</a>
*   Installation of barbed wires on lower decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="027:21:00">[027:21:00]</a>
*   Creation of secure safe rooms for crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="027:23:00">[027:23:00]</a>
*   Use of foam machines and high-powered water cannons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="027:26:00">[027:26:00]</a>
*   Deployment of sonic devices to deter pirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="027:29:00">[027:29:00]</a>

## Decline and Resurgence of Piracy
These combined efforts led to a significant decline in piracy incidents. From a peak of 237 incidents in 2011, the number dropped to 75 in 2012 and just 15 in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="026:39:00">[026:39:00]</a>. Between 2017 and 2023, successful hijackings became extremely rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="027:51:00">[027:51:00]</a>.

However, the Hamas-Israel war in 2023 diverted US Navy ships from the region towards Yemen's Houthi rebels, creating an opportunity for [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]] to resurface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="028:06:00">[028:06:00]</a>. Recent incidents include:
*   The hijacking of cargo vessel MV Roen on December 14, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="028:20:00">[028:20:00]</a>. Its hostages were rescued by the Indian Navy in March 2024, leading to the surrender of 35 pirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="028:29:00">[028:29:00]</a>.
*   A Bangladeshi ship hijacked on March 12, 2024, which was released a month later for a $5 million ransom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="028:44:00">[028:44:00]</a>.
*   A Chinese fishing ship hijacked in November 2024, in which the ship's own security guards reportedly joined the pirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="028:52:00">[028:52:00]</a>. This ship was released two months later for $2 million after initial demands for $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="029:04:00">[029:04:00]</a>.

## Underlying Issues and Local Perception
Despite global efforts to combat piracy, the issue remains complex due to the underlying sociopolitical conditions in Somalia. The severe food and job shortages, coupled with the legacy of [[history_and_geopolitical_significance_of_somalia | civil war]] and [[illegal_fishing_and_toxic_waste_dumping_in_somalia | illegal fishing and toxic waste dumping]] in Somali waters, led many young men to resort to [[piracy_tactics_and_ransom_economics | piracy]] as their only means of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

Many Somalis view the pirates not as villains but as "Robin Hood" figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, or "Badaadinta Badah" (The Saviours of the Sea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="019:59:00">[019:59:00]</a>, who are protecting their territorial waters and resources from foreign exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="014:30:00">[014:30:00]</a>. A survey found that about 70% of Somali people support piracy as a form of national defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="029:24:00">[029:24:00]</a>. Pirates argue that those who illegally enter Somali waters, steal fish, and dump toxic waste are the real pirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="029:35:00">[029:35:00]</a>.

International organizations acknowledge that the root cause of piracy is poverty and unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="030:01:00">[030:01:00]</a>, with piracy being most prevalent in areas with high instances of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="030:05:00">[030:05:00]</a>. However, the presence of local gangsters and the transformation of piracy into an organized, profitable industry complicates this view, as many pirates are not simply helpless individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="030:59:00">[030:59:00]</a>.

Soft drinks have become ubiquitous globally, with Coca-Cola alone selling 1.9 billion servings daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Despite their widespread consumption, these beverages contain ingredients that pose significant health risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Debunking the "Toilet Cleaner" Myth

A common misconception is that soft drinks are comparable to toilet cleaners due to shared acidic components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This comparison is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. While both contain acids, soft drinks use mild acids like citric acid (found naturally in lemons and oranges) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a> and phosphoric acid (a common food-grade additive, E338, which prevents bacterial growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Phosphoric acid is also found in jams, processed meats, cereals, and cheeses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

Toilet cleaners, however, contain stronger chemicals like Sodium Hypochlorite and Hydrochloric Acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Although hydrochloric acid is also present in human stomach acid, this does not make stomachs comparable to toilet cleaners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

The pH level of soft drinks (around 2.5) is similar to that of lemon juice (2.0-2.6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> and pomegranates (around 2.9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, further disproving the comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Why Soft Drinks Are Dangerous

Despite myths, soft drinks are still hazardous to health due to their actual [[ingredients_in_popular_soft_drinks | ingredients]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Contamination Concerns
While the video focuses on standard ingredients, there have been instances of contamination. News reports from 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2016 indicated high levels of pesticide residues in soft drinks sold in Delhi, with Coke brands showing 30 times higher and Pepsi brands 36 times higher residues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### Empty Calories and Excessive Sugar
A 600ml bottle of Mirinda contains 330 calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, equivalent to two aloo parathas or a masala dosa with sambar and chutney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Unlike wholesome meals, soft drinks offer "empty calories" without essential nutrients like protein, sodium, potassium, vitamins, fibers, or fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

The primary concern is the high sugar content. A 600ml bottle of Mirinda contains 82.8 grams of added sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. The American Heart Association states that the body requires zero added sugar to function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. The recommended daily limit for added sugar is 36 grams for adult men and 25 grams for adult women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. A single 600ml bottle of Mirinda far exceeds these limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

Regular consumption of such high amounts of added sugar can lead to severe health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, including:
*   Joint pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>
*   Undue skin ageing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>
*   Liver damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>
*   [[impact_of_sugar_on_health_and_alternatives_to_sugary_drinks | Type 2 diabetes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>
*   Pancreatic breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>
*   Kidney failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>
*   Increased risk of heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>
*   Obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>

### [[sugar_addiction_comparison_to_drugs | Sugar Addiction]]
Sugar can be as addictive as drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. A 2017 study even compared sugar addiction to cocaine addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. This explains why people who drink soft drinks often consume them regularly, or consume other high-sugar items like candies, chocolates, and ice creams regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

### [[Artificial sweeteners and their controversies | Artificial Sweeteners]] in Diet Drinks
Diet soft drinks, like Diet Pepsi and Diet Coke, contain zero calories and zero added sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, but use artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin, or sucralose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. These sweeteners have a controversial history, with many studies linking them to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. A 2022 French study on 100,000 adults found that aspartame increases the risk of cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Other studies have linked them to heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, kidney and liver toxicity, mental health problems, and even birth defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

### Caramel Colouring
The dark brown colour in Pepsi and Coca-Cola comes from caramel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. Caramel is produced by heating sugar with ammonia and sulphites, which releases a byproduct called 4-Methylimidazole (4-MI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. Several studies link 4-MI to cancer, and it is listed as a carcinogen in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. California law prohibits food or drinks with more than 29 micrograms of 4-MI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. In 2012, samples of soft drinks were found to contain 138 micrograms of 4-MI, more than four times the permitted limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. While Coca-Cola changed its formula in America after the controversy, it did not do so in countries like India, where similar laws may not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. This issue re-emerged in 2014 with similar findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

### Synthetic Food Colour (E110/Sunset Yellow FCF)
Orange-coloured soft drinks like Mirinda and Fanta use synthetic food colour E110, also known as Sunset Yellow FCF, which is an Azo Dye produced from petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. In 1973, Benjamin Feingold found that artificial food flavours caused hyperactivity and affected attention spans in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. As a result, Norway, Finland, and Sweden banned Sunset Yellow FCF by 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. A 2007 study linked E110 to attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. The UK Food Standards Agency recommended banning artificial colours in 2008, leading to a 2010 EU regulation requiring labels stating "it may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children" if artificial colours are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. However, companies continue to use these ingredients in countries without such regulations, like India, where E110 is still permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

### Preservative E211 (Sodium Benzoate)
Preservative E211, or Sodium Benzoate, was found to form Benzene in soft drinks when it reacts with Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) in the presence of heat and light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. Benzene is a gas emitted from vehicle exhausts and burning coal or petrol, and it causes cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. After a controversy in 2007 and subsequent lawsuits, Coca-Cola announced in 2008 that it would remove Sodium Benzoate from its products in regions where court cases were fought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>, but it remains a popular preservative in countries like India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. Excessive sodium intake can also lead to hypertension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>.

### Phosphoric Acid
While less harmful than other ingredients, large amounts of phosphoric acid can damage teeth and lead to dental corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>.

### Other Ingredients
Other ingredients include acidity regulators like Citric Acid (E330) and Sodium Citrate (E331), and stabilizers like Starch Sodium Octenyl Succinate (E1450) and Ester Gum (E445) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>. These help maintain taste, reduce acidity, prevent oxidation, and ensure a homogenous solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. Carbonated water, infused with carbon dioxide, provides the fizz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. Ultimately, soft drinks are essentially "sugary sodas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

## Marketing and Awareness
Despite their health risks, major companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, along with McDonald's and Kellogg's, agreed in 2014 not to market products to children under 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. However, indirect marketing persists through sponsorships of school events and inclusion of children in advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. Some celebrities, like Virat Kohli and Amitabh Bachchan, have publicly refused to endorse soft drinks due to health concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>.

## Unsuitable Alternatives and The Solution

### Why Fruit Juices and Lemonades Aren't Ideal
Fresh fruit juices and lemonades, while free of some chemicals, still contain high amounts of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. Lemonades often have added sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>. Fresh fruit juices concentrate natural sugars; for example, one glass of orange juice requires about six oranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. Consuming such concentrated natural sugars in large quantities can still increase overall sugar intake significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>.

### The Best Alternative
The simplest and healthiest alternative to soft drinks, fruit juices, and lemonades is plain water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:00">[22:16:00]</a>. Gradually replacing sugary drinks with water helps taste buds adjust to a lower sugar intake, making sugary products less appealing over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>. Embracing pure water is a key step towards a [[importance_of_a_balanced_diet_and_healthy_lifestyle | healthier lifestyle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>.

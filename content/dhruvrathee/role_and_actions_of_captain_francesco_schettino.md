Francesco Schettino was the captain of the [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]], an Italian cruise ship that ran aground on January 13, 2012, leading to the ship's partial sinking and the loss of 32 lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. His actions before, during, and after the disaster were widely criticized and led to his conviction.

## Background and Ship Details

Schettino had been working for Costa Crociere, the Italian company operating the ship, since 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]], launched in June 2006, was the biggest Italian cruise ship of its time, costing $570 million to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It was larger than the [[The Titanics maiden voyage and iceberg collision timeline | Titanic]] and could accommodate 2,000 more passengers, carrying 4,252 people on its fateful voyage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Deviating from the Planned Route

On January 13, 2012, at 7:18 PM, the [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]] set sail for its 7-day European tour, with its first destination being Savona, Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Just two hours into the journey, Captain Schettino intentionally deviated from the normal route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He wanted to perform a "sail past" or "sail by" near Giglio Island, Italy, so the islanders could see the illuminated ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This maneuver brought the ship within 150 meters of the shore, where the water was not deep enough for such a large vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport later confirmed the ship was sailing at an unsafe distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Schettino's motivation for this deviation was to pay tribute to Senior Captain Mario Palombo, who lived on Giglio Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Schettino called Palombo at 9:40 PM to inform him they would sound a siren as they passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## The Collision and Captain's Initial Response

Minutes after the call, at 9:45 PM, the [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]] collided with rocks in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This collision tore a 70-meter-long wound in the ship's hull, causing water to rapidly flood the lower rooms and engine areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Despite the severe damage, Schettino initially hid the truth from the passengers, announcing via intercom that there was only an electrical failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Even after the chief engineer informed him of the dire situation in the engine room, Schettino continued to assure passengers that "there was nothing to worry about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

At around 10:00 PM, Schettino made a crucial decision to turn the ship around, reasoning that it would be safer for the ship to sink near the island than in the middle of the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This U-turn caused the ship to tilt towards the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

For over 30 minutes after the collision, Schettino maintained his false narrative, even telling the Italian Coast Guard at 10:28 PM that it was "simply a blackout" and "nothing devastating" had happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. It was only at 10:22 PM that he instructed the radio operator to inform the Coast Guard of a collision and request tugboat assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Delayed Evacuation and Abandonment

The general emergency alarm was finally raised at 10:33 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. More than an hour after the collision, at 10:54 PM, Captain Schettino gave the order to abandon the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. By this time, the ship was tilted by 30° <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Immediately after giving the order, Schettino was among the first crew members to abandon the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. At 11:19 PM, he had left the sinking vessel and headed towards Giglio Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

::: info Captain Coward
During the [[rescue_and_evacuation_efforts_of_costa_concordia_passengers | evacuation]], Italian Coast Guard Commander Captain Gregorio De Falco called Schettino at 12:42 AM, ordering him to return to the ship and assess the situation with the trapped passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. De Falco angrily told Schettino that he should "go back on the ship" as the captain and that he "shouldn't have left his passengers and ran away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Schettino made excuses and did not return to the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This earned him the nickname "Captain Coward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

Schettino's actions contrasted sharply with the heroism of many crew members, such as Indian staff member Karnaatha Rameshana and waiter Russell Rebello, who continued [[rescue_and_evacuation_efforts_of_costa_concordia_passengers | helping passengers]] despite the chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Russel Rebello tragically drowned while assisting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Civilian Mario Pellegrini, the deputy mayor of Giglio Island, also selflessly boarded the ship to rescue trapped individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Trial and Conviction

The [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Costa Concordia]] disaster resulted in 32 fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Many victims died trapped in their cabins, a situation that could have been avoided if they had been informed earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

During his trial, Schettino's tendency to lie was evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. He claimed that he didn't abandon the ship intentionally but "slipped and fell into a lifeboat" when the ship was tilted at a 60°-70° angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. This argument was not believed by the judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

In 2017, Captain Schettino was charged with manslaughter and sentenced to 16 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Mario Palombo, Schettino's former senior captain, revealed that Schettino had always been a liar and preferred to hide his mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

Another captain, Roberto Bosio, who was a passenger on the [[costa_concordia_cruise_ship_disaster_overview | Concordia]] that night, remained on board, helping passengers even before Schettino's official announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Bosio stated, "Only a disgraceful man would have left all those passengers on board" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

Along with Schettino, five other high-ranking officers were arrested and sentenced to two years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. As of 2024, 11 years after the incident, Schettino continues to serve his sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. The disaster serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of leaders who fail to admit mistakes and mislead others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, is a Bronze Age civilization primarily located in modern-day Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Northwest India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. It is often compared with other prominent ancient civilizations due to its unique characteristics and its mysteries.

## Age and Contemporaries

The Indus Valley Civilization existed alongside a few other major ancient civilizations, including the Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Chinese civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Of these, the Chinese Civilization was the most recent, making the Indus Valley, Egyptian, and Mesopotamian civilizations among the oldest known to humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

While Mesopotamia is commonly believed to be the oldest civilization, a 2016 study by IIT Kharagpur and ASI, utilizing archaeological dating techniques, suggested that the Indus Valley Civilization might be as old as 8,000 years, with evidence of farming settlements dating back to 7,000 BC found in present-day Haryana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Urban Planning and Infrastructure

The cities of the Indus Valley Civilization displayed remarkably advanced urban planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. By 2,600 BC, they had multistoried brick houses built with standardized measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Each house featured a toilet, a bathing area, and a drainage system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Roads had proper gutters, footpaths with trees, and public wells and dustbins were available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Their urban planning was perhaps even better than some Indian cities today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

A prominent feature is the Great Bath in Mohenjo-Daro, a large, multi-storied swimming pool built with burnt bricks and waterproofed with natural tar, featuring a drainage hole and a well for fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. The high level of cleanliness and advanced drainage systems across their cities suggest Mohenjo-Daro might have served as the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

## Societal Structure and Governance

A significant [[historical_interpretations_and_biases | difference]] between the Indus Valley Civilization and the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations lies in the absence of certain key structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Historians have found no evidence of:
*   Temples, mosques, or other religious sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.
*   Palaces or royal tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   A monarch, priests, religious leaders, an army, or warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>.

This is considered quite shocking by historians, as religion was very common in other Bronze Age civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. It suggests that the Harappan people may have been advanced, living peacefully without a significant social hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. This remains a highly [[historical_interpretations_and_biases | debated topic]] among historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

## Language and Script Decipherment

The Indus Script, found on over 4,000 artifacts such as stone slabs, tablets, and copper plates, remains undeciphered despite over 100 attempts since the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

One major reason for this is the lack of a "Rosetta Stone" equivalent for the Indus Script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

### Egyptian Hieroglyphs: A Deciphered Example
In contrast, the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, a logosyllabic script like the Indus Script, were deciphered due to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This stone contained the same text written in both Egyptian hieroglyphs and ancient Greek, which was already understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. This allowed historians to "Google Translate" the unknown Egyptian language using the known Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

## Trade Relations

The discovery of the Indus Script in Mesopotamian historical sites (present-day Iraq and Iran) indicates that there were extensive trade relations between these two ancient civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. People moved between these distant cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

Interestingly, while Mesopotamia had its own distinct language, evidence suggests Mesopotamians might have used the Indus Script to write their own language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. This is inferred from patterns in the script; for instance, a jar-shaped symbol, which usually appears once at the end of texts in the Indus Valley, is repeated twice in Mesopotamian findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. This parallels modern instances where one language (e.g., Hindi) might be written using the script of another (e.g., Latin script for `KYA` or `AARAM`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

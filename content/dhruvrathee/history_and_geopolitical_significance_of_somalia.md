Somalia, located as the most north-eastern country in Africa, holds significant geopolitical importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:45">[07:02:45]</a>. It borders the Indian Ocean to its east and the Gulf of Eden to its north, separating it from Middle Eastern countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. This location is crucial because about 20% of global shipping trade passes through this area, which lies between South Asia, Africa, and the Arab countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:35">[07:19:35]</a>.

## Historical Overview

Historically, Northern Somalia was under British rule, while Southern Somalia was ruled by Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:95">[07:24:95]</a>. Their colonial rule ended in 1960 when Somalia gained independence and both parts were unified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:10">[07:29:10]</a>. July 1, 1960, is celebrated as the Independence Day of this unified nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:10">[07:37:10]</a>.

Nine years later, problems began when Somalia's President Abdirashid Ali was shot dead by his bodyguards on October 15, 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:35">[07:47:35]</a>. Following this, the Army Chief General led a military coup and declared himself the new president, establishing Somalia as a dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:45">[07:56:45]</a>.

### Clan Divisions and Civil War

Unlike some countries that use religion and race for division, Somali dictators utilized clan identities to divide their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:30">[08:05:30]</a>. Clan-based discrimination led to tension and violence, eventually escalating into a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. The civil war peaked on January 27, 1991, when rival clans united to expel President Said Barre from power, leading to the complete collapse of Somalia's central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:10">[08:28:10]</a>. With the government's collapse, clans fought for control of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:20">[08:41:20]</a>.

During this period, northern Somalia declared itself an independent country called Somaliland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Though they function as separate countries today, most other nations do not recognize Somaliland as independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. The civil war, coupled with starvation and disease, resulted in the deaths of 350,000 people within a year in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. It was at this critical juncture that [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali pirates]] emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

## Emergence of Piracy

The sea near Somalia is rich in marine life, with high concentrations of fish like tuna, sardines, shrimps, and rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:50">[09:17:50]</a>. With the country's instability, foreign fishing vessels exploited the situation, engaging in [[illegal_fishing_and_toxic_waste_dumping_in_somalia | illegal fishing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. A 2006 United Nations report indicated that after the central government collapsed, Somalia's coast guard ceased operations, leaving its waters unprotected and open to exploitation by fishing vessels from around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. This threatened the livelihoods of local fishermen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Annually, an estimated $300 million worth of seafood was stolen from the Somali coastline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:30">[10:15:30]</a>. Foreign vessels used destructive methods like steel-made drag fishing nets, damaging coral reefs and endangering future livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

In addition to [[illegal_fishing_and_toxic_waste_dumping_in_somalia | illegal fishing]], foreign companies began [[illegal_fishing_and_toxic_waste_dumping_in_somalia | dumping toxic industrial waste]] on the Somali coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. Since the 1980s, European companies dumped toxic elements like uranium, lead, cadmium, and mercury, a practice that increased significantly after the government fell in 1991, with waste also being dumped into the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:70">[10:59:70]</a>. Swiss and Italian companies, along with waste from German, French, and Italian nuclear power plants and hospitals, were involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Proper waste disposal in Europe was 400 times more expensive than illegal dumping in Somalia, costing $2.5 per tonne in Somalia versus $250 per tonne in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

Local warlords were contracted, receiving weapons in exchange for allowing waste dumping, a practice known as "Guns for Waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. This also facilitated the flow of weapons into Somalia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. Italian mafia was also involved, and journalists investigating this trade were murdered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

The devastating tsunami in December 2004 broke toxic waste containers in Somali waters, releasing waste onto the coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. This led to widespread illness, including acute respiratory infections, bleeding gums, brain hemorrhages, skin rashes, and an increase in cancer cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

Facing civil war, poverty, starvation, depleted fish stocks due to illegal fishing, and the health impacts of toxic waste, Somali fishermen began patrolling and attacking foreign illegal fishing vessels, calling themselves "Coast Guards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Initially for protection, these groups soon realized they could earn money, leading to the rise of piracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

### The Rise of [[somali_pirates__robin_hood_or_villains | Somali Pirates]]

These fishermen allied with armed local goons, forming groups like the Somali Coastguards and National Volunteer Coastguards, to hijack foreign fishing vessels for ransom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. With initial success, poor and troubled youth joined, making piracy an occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. They upgraded from fishing boats to speedboats, tracking devices, and better weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>. Piracy became prominent in Puntland, a region that declared itself autonomous in 1998, becoming a safe haven and "Pirates' Capital" from 2005 to 2012, especially its city, Eyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

Piracy evolved into an organized industry with armed gangs, recruiters, financiers, and mission commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>. Investors funded operations, with returns on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. By 2008, piracy became Somalia's most productive industry, generating $50 million within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>. Between 2005 and 2012, pirates earned $339 to $413 million in ransom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. Individual pirates could earn $30,000 to $75,000 per hijacking, plus a bonus for being the first to board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. Ransoms were often paid by private shipping companies or insurance companies with "Kidnap and Ransom Insurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.

In many areas of Somalia, these pirates were seen as "Robin Hood" figures, sharing money with the poor and disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>. Hostages often reported being treated well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. Pirates justified their actions as a "legitimate tax" due to the absence of a central government, calling themselves "Badaadinta Badah" (Saviours of the Sea) or coast guards in the local language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>.

### The Maersk Alabama Incident

A notable incident occurred on April 8, 2009, when the American-flagged ship Maersk Alabama, carrying humanitarian aid cargo, was hijacked about 440 km off Somalia's coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Four pirates, led by 18-year-old Abdiwali Abdiqadir Musi, boarded the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The crew managed to retake the ship and capture Musi, but the pirates kidnapped Captain Richard Phillips in exchange for Musi's return, taking him on a lifeboat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This event gained significant international media coverage, especially as it marked the first time an American ship was hijacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

The USS Bainbridge, a US warship, tracked the lifeboat for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. After negotiations for a $2 million ransom failed, Captain Phillips attempted an escape but was recaptured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>. Ultimately, US Navy SEAL snipers shot dead three pirates, rescuing Captain Phillips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. Musi was captured and sentenced to 33 years in a US prison, becoming the first person since 1885 to face trial for piracy in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>.

### Combating Piracy and Recent Resurgence

To control [[global_efforts_to_combat_piracy_in_somalia | Somali pirates]], America and other countries launched international naval missions like Task Force 151 in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>. The European Union and NATO initiated counter-piracy missions, while China, Russia, and India also deployed warships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>. Piracy incidents significantly decreased from 237 in 2011 to 15 in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:00">[26:39:00]</a>.

The most impactful measure was the deployment of armed security guards on commercial vessels, making hijackings challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>. No commercial vessel with armed security guards has been successfully hijacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>. Commercial ships also increased speed, installed barbed wires, secure safe rooms, foam machines, water cannons, and sonic devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>. Some Somali clans distanced themselves from piracy as pirates' newfound wealth led to drug involvement and disruption of traditional culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>. From 2017 to 2023, successful cargo ship hijackings became rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.

However, the Hamas-Israel war in 2023 diverted US Navy ships from the area, providing an opportunity for pirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>. On December 14, 2023, the MV Roen was hijacked after many years, with its hostages rescued by the Indian Navy in March 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>. A Bangladeshi ship was hijacked in March 2024 and released for $5 million, and a Chinese fishing ship was hijacked in November 2024, with its security guards even joining the pirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>.

Despite these recent incidents, a 70% of Somali people surveyed support piracy as a form of national defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>. They believe the true "pirates" are those who illegally exploit Somali waters and dump toxic waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>. While other countries have addressed piracy, the toxic and nuclear waste in Somalia's waters remains uncleaned, and no compensation has been provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:00">[29:49:00]</a>. International organizations identify poverty and unemployment as the root causes of piracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>. Similar patterns of piracy driven by perceived injustice and exploitation are observed in places like the Gulf of Guinea in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a>.

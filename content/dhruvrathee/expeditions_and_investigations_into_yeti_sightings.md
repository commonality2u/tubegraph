The Yeti, often referred to as the "Abominable Snowman," has been the subject of numerous expeditions and investigations over centuries, fueled by thousands of years of [[historical_and_cultural_accounts_of_the_yeti | historical and cultural accounts of the Yeti]] in Himalayan regions like India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Tibet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. These efforts have sought to find scientific proof of its existence, leading to both sensational claims and rigorous [[scientific_analysis_of_alleged_Yeti_evidence | scientific analysis of alleged Yeti evidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Early Sightings and Explorations

Stories about Yeti are ancient, with some originating from the pre-Buddhist era and passed down through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Interest intensified in modern times following various reports:

*   **1832 - Brian Hodgson's Account:** British naturalist Brian Hodgson mentioned encountering a giant non-human creature covered in long black fur in an article for the *Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal*. He described it as an orangutan, though orangutans are not native to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **1889 - Major LA Waddell's Discovery:** British Army Physician Major LA Waddell observed footprints on Himalayan glaciers that appeared to be of a hominid species, such as monkeys or humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   **1921 - Charles Howard-Bury's Expedition:** Climber Charles Howard-Bury and his team, returning from Mount Everest, reported seeing huge footprints. Local guides identified these as belonging to "Metoh Kangmi" (Man-Bear Snow-Man), which was famously mistranslated by a journalist as "Abominable Snowman," a term still used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
*   **1937 - Multiple Expeditions:** By this year, there were frequent discoveries related to Yeti. Explorer HW Tilman and British Army Officer John Hunt both reported seeing Yeti footprints on the Zemu Glacier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:22]</a>. In total, seven expeditions encountered such footprints, with two claiming to have actually seen a Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

## The 1951 Eric Shipton Photographs

The most famous story concerning the Yeti is from 1951 when British Mountaineer Eric Shipton and surgeon Michael Ward, while searching for an alternative route to Mount Everest, spotted large footprints on the Menlung Glacier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. These footprints were 13 inches long and 8 inches wide, resembling human feet but significantly larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Shipton photographed the prints, placing his axe for scale, and these photos became widely published, sparking global fascination and being seen as strong evidence for the Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## The Yeti Craze and Government Regulations

Shipton's photos initiated a "race" for Yeti discovery, with people from around the world flocking to the Himalayan mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

*   **1953 Daily Mail Expedition:** The British newspaper *Daily Mail* funded an expedition, including journalists and mountaineers, costing $1.35 million in today's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. During this expedition, they visited Pangboche Monastery, which locals claimed housed a Yeti's skull. A hair sample was taken from the alleged skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Analysis:** Initial analysis of the hair sample concluded it belonged to neither a human nor an animal, and was not even hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Later testing further confirmed it did not belong to an unknown cryptic creature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.
*   **Tom Slick's Expeditions (1957-1959):** American oilman Tom Slick conducted multiple expeditions in search of the Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.
    *   His first expedition found three Yeti footprints and hair strands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.
    *   His second expedition used bloodhounds trained on mountain lions and bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.
    *   He visited four monasteries to study alleged Yeti skulls and mummified hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.
    *   Upon returning, Slick theorized there might be three types of Yetis: one supernatural and two real, with one real type matching Shipton's description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. His research ended prematurely with his death in an airplane crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

### Government Regulations (1959)

Due to the intense interest, the US and Nepal governments collaborated to establish regulations for Yeti expeditions in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. These regulations included:
*   A royalty fee of 5000 Indian Rupees for a Yeti search permit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.
*   A ban on hunting Yeti, though killing in self-defense was excusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>.
*   Any captured Yeti had to be surrendered to the Nepalese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>.
*   All reports of Yeti existence required government permission before being released to the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.

These regulations were partly formed because both the Nepali and American governments considered the possibility of the Yeti being real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

## Key Investigators and Their Conclusions

### Peter Byrne
Irish American explorer Peter Byrne participated in five expeditions, spending 38 months in the Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. He visited Pangboche Monastery, which claimed to possess Yeti remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. After initial refusal, he acquired a finger from the alleged "Yeti's hand" through a donation to the monastery and smuggled it to London with actor James Stewart's help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>.
*   **Analysis:** Professor William Osman Hill analyzed the finger, concluding it was human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

### Reinhold Messner
Italian climber Reinhold Messner, initially a skeptic who denied Yeti's existence, had a life-changing encounter in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. While lost on a Tibetan path, he saw a large, dark creature standing upright, running fast, and jumping between trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. This creature, about 7 feet tall, was only 10 steps away from him before disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. This encounter led him to spend 12 years searching for the Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** Messner ultimately concluded that Yetis do not exist as human-like abominable snowmen, instead identifying the creature he saw as a Himalayan brown bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>. This is a common [[comparisons_between_yeti_myths_and_real_animal_discoveries | comparison between Yeti myths and real animal discoveries]].

### Daniel C. Taylor
American author Daniel C. Taylor, who wrote 'Yeti: The Ecology of a Mystery,' spent many years researching Yeti, focusing on Nepal's dense Barun Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. He discovered fresh footprints that initially convinced him he had found a Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** His investigation revealed the footprints belonged to a tree bear (Rukh Bhaalu in Nepali) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. DNA analysis of a hair strand found in a suspected Yeti lair confirmed it was from this bear species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.
*   **Footprint Explanation:** Taylor explained that tree bears place their hind legs on the footprints of their front legs, making it appear as if a bipedal creature walked through the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. The overlap often makes the combined print look larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. He noted that while Eric Shipton's viral photo showed large, human-like footprints, a second photo from the same series clearly depicted bear footprints but did not gain widespread attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>.

### Other Notable Conclusions
*   **Ernst Schafer (1939):** A zoologist on a secret mission sponsored by the Nazi Party to Tibet, concluded that Yeti does not exist. He believed that what locals called Yeti was a Tibetan bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.
*   **Edmund Hillary:** The first person to climb Mount Everest, after months of searching for Yeti, concluded it was a myth born from people's superstitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>.

## Modern Scientific Analyses

Recent [[scientific_analysis_of_alleged_Yeti_evidence | scientific analysis of alleged Yeti evidence]] further discredits the existence of a distinct Yeti species:

*   **Oxford University Study (2014):** Geneticist Bryan Sykes tested over 30 hair samples from the Himalayas, all claimed to be from Yeti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.
    *   Most samples were identified as from known animals like horses or bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>.
    *   Two samples initially didn't match any known species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>. However, other scientists rechecked the data and found these two samples were from a rare sub-species of the Himalayan brown bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.
*   **New York University Research (2017):** This study reached the same conclusion, performing DNA analysis on over nine alleged Yeti samples (hair, bones, teeth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>.
    *   Eight samples were identified as from Asian black bears, Himalayan brown bears, or Tibetan brown bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>.
    *   One sample was from a dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>.

## Case Study: The Arunachal Pradesh Incident (2008)

In 2008, a worker building a military camp for the Indian Army in Arunachal Pradesh was found dead with a broken neck, but no other marks or signs of robbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Doctors stated the neck injury required significant force not easily caused by a human, and the absence of claw marks ruled out wild animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Locals claimed police found a hair sample on the corpse, which tested as neither human nor animal, and a footprint alleged to be from a Yeti, leading to the belief a Yeti killed the worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The area was reportedly frequented by Yetis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

*   **2019 Indian Army Tweet:** Eleven years later, on April 29, 2019, the Indian Army's mountaineering expedition team claimed via Twitter to have seen large Yeti footprints (32 inches long, 15 inches wide) near Makalu Base Camp in Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. They stated photographic evidence was handed over for scientific evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **BBC Radio Investigation:** Journalists Andrew Benfield and Richard Horsey investigated the Arunachal Pradesh incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.
    *   They found the police FIR stated the cause of death was unknown and made no mention of Yeti or footprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>.
    *   The doctor who allegedly tested the hair sample clarified that it was not hair at all, but a part of a plant or leaf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>.

## The [[myth_versus_reality_in_yeti_legends | Myth versus Reality]]

Despite historical and modern claims, the lack of verifiable evidence, especially in the era of smartphones, has led to a general scientific consensus that the Yeti does not exist as a unique creature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>. Most alleged sightings and evidence have been attributed to known animals, particularly bears, or misinterpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

One theory suggests that the Yeti legends may have originated from encounters with the extinct ape, Gigantopithecus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>. This 10-foot-tall ape, weighing 200-300 kg and covered in thick fur, lived between 2 million and 200,000 years ago, with fossils found near the Himalayas. It's plausible that early humans interacted with this animal, passing down stories that evolved into the Yeti folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the Yeti represents a [[myth_versus_reality_in_yeti_legends | fascination with the unknown]] and a desire for escape from modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. However, the real world offers countless undiscovered species, with only 10-20% of Earth's species documented so far, highlighting the need to protect existing biodiversity rather than chase myths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>.

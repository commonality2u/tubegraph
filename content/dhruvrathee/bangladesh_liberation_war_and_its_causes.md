The 1971 India-Pakistan War led to the birth of a new country, Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The conflict was initiated because Bangladesh sought independence from Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Historical Context Before Partition

Before the British Raj, the Indian subcontinent, encompassing present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Burma, and Sri Lanka, comprised thousands of autonomous kingdoms, each with distinct languages, traditions, and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The Bengal region, including modern-day Bangladesh and West Bengal, was primarily ruled by Muslim monarchs starting from the 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Mohammad Bakhtiyar Khilji, founder of the Khilji dynasty, began Muslim rule in the early 13th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:02:02]</a>. These rulers were less interested in religious preaching and more focused on integrating local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:10]</a>. High-office holders, traders, and musicians under these monarchs came from diverse religious backgrounds, fostering co-existence and intermingling between Islam and Hinduism, which largely controlled extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:31]</a>.

In 1757, the East India Company took control of this area, leading to British Rule until the devastating Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Partition of India and Pakistan

The Lahore Resolution, drafted in 1940 at the All India Muslim League's annual session, demanded a separate state for Muslims, driven by fears of being a minority in a united India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:16]</a>. The drawing of borders along religious lines during partition disregarded existing social, commercial, and cultural relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:24]</a>. Large states with common cultures and languages, such as Punjab and Bengal, were divided based solely on religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:36]</a>. A portion of Punjab went to Pakistan, and a part remained with India, with the same happening for Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:45]</a>. Despite the division, people continued to speak the same languages and follow the same cultures and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:53]</a>.

Muslims in Bengal who favored Pakistan hoped that a new Muslim country would improve their standard of living, financial and social conditions, and secure their fundamental rights, especially as many felt inferior to Hindu landlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:04:13]</a>. The partition led to mass migration, riots, and mob violence, with an estimated death toll ranging from 200,000 to 2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:34]</a>. Many Muslim Biharis migrated to East Pakistan and were later labeled 'Anti-Bangladeshi' due to their perceived allegiance to West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:05:03]</a>.

Initially, Bengal as a single state voted against Partition if it meant becoming part of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:14]</a>. However, West Bengal desired partition to join India, while East Bengal did not want partition but would join Pakistan if it was inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:30]</a>. Consequently, West Bengal became part of India, and East Bengal became East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:36]</a>.

The newly formed country of Pakistan was divided into two parts, separated by 1,500km of Indian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:45]</a>. Bengalis constituted the majority ethnic group in Pakistan, making up more than half its population and residing in East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:56]</a>. Despite their majority, powerful positions in bureaucracy, military, and politics were concentrated in West Pakistan, specifically in the hands of Mohajirs and Punjabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Political Developments in Pakistan (1947-1971)

Pakistan began as a Parliamentary Democracy, similar to India, but with a highly powerful Central Government where power was concentrated in one person, preventing the establishment of a robust democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:41]</a>. Mohammad Ali Jinnah became Pakistan's Governor General, succeeded by Nazimuddin after his death in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:07:00]</a>. Liaquat Ali Khan became the Prime Minister but was assassinated in 1951, leading to Nazimuddin becoming Prime Minister and appointing Ghulam Muhammad as Governor General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:16]</a>.

Pakistan experienced its first military coup in 1953 when Ghulam Muhammad dismissed Nazimuddin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:23]</a>. In 1954 elections, the United Front, a coalition of opposition parties, won most seats, with the Awami League from East Bengal being the largest party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:38]</a>. Ghulam Muhammad, however, dismissed the entire constituent assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:43]</a>. In 1955, Major General Iskandar Mirza became Governor General, and under his tenure, East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:57]</a>.

Between 1947 and 1971, Pakistan underwent multiple phases of military rule, which meant political parties were forcefully deprived of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:12]</a>. People in East Bengal were particularly denied political representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Causes of the War

### Economic and Political Imbalance

Most of Pakistan's national budget (75%) was spent on West Pakistan, despite East Pakistan generating 62% of the government's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:33]</a>. This resulted in evident economic development in West Pakistan, where per capita income was 61% higher than in East Pakistan during 1969-70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:46]</a>. Additionally, 25 times more military personnel were stationed in West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:49]</a>.

### [[influence_of_language_imposition_and_cultural_differences_leading_to_bangladeshs_independence | Language Imposition]]

A critical issue was the language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:53]</a>. Jinnah and his advisors believed that unifying East and West Pakistan required a common language, which they decided should be Urdu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:09:03]</a>. West Pakistani rulers imposed Urdu, forcing its use for official purposes and in the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:15]</a>. However, the majority of people in East Pakistan were Bengalis who spoke Bangla (56% of Pakistanis spoke Bangla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:21]</a>. Urdu was seen as the language of the elite, while Bangla was spoken by common people in Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:30]</a>.

On March 21, 1948, Mohammad Ali Jinnah declared in Dhaka that Urdu would be the sole state language of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:41]</a>. This caused outrage among Bengalis, leading to the Bengali Language Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:57]</a>. A major protest on February 21, 1952, saw students and political activists gather in front of the Provincial Assembly, where Pakistani army open-fired, killing five people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:15]</a>. February 21st is now celebrated as Language Martyr's Day in Bangladesh and was later declared International Mother Language Day by UNESCO in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:27]</a>. Although Bangla was given official status in 1954 and became a state language in 1956, people's commitment to Bengali culture and language had strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Six Point Demand

The 1965 war between India and Pakistan left East Pakistan with a weak defense, exacerbating the economic and political imbalance between East and West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:11:00]</a>. This led to the Six Point Demand for East Pakistan's economic development, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a founding leader of the Awami League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:14]</a>.

The demands included:
*   Transforming Pakistan into a Federation State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   Granting more autonomy to East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   Giving East Pakistan's government control over its resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   Establishing two separate currencies for East and West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   Allowing East Pakistan to have independent foreign reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   Forming a separate military force for East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:43]</a>.

These demands were seen as an attempt to make East Pakistan an independent country, infuriating the West Pakistani government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:52]</a>. All demands were rejected and labeled as separatist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Agartala Conspiracy Case and Political Upheaval

On June 19, 1968, under Ayub Khan's government, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 34 other Bengali civil and military officers were arrested and charged with sedition in the Agartala Conspiracy Case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:23]</a>. General Ayub Khan alleged that Sheikh Mujibur and his associates were collaborating with India in Agartala (Tripura) to create an independent Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:36]</a>.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had become a popular political leader and the voice of Bengalis, who suffered cruelty, discrimination, and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:50]</a>. His arrest led to large-scale protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:58]</a>. The killing of Sergeant Zahurul Haq, one of Mujibur's imprisoned associates, by a prison guard further fueled public anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:13:08]</a>. Facing the worsening situation, General Ayub Khan released Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on February 22, 1969, and withdrew the Agartala Conspiracy Case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:23]</a>. However, widespread demonstrations, protests, and labor strikes forced Ayub Khan, who had run a military dictatorship for 10 years, to resign in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:42]</a>. He appointed General Yahya Khan as his successor, who promised to hold the first general elections in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:57]</a>.

### 1970 General Elections and Its Aftermath

The 1970 elections yielded shocking results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:05]</a>. The Awami League, East Pakistan's political party, won 167 out of 313 seats, nearly every seat in East Pakistan, but none in West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:15]</a>. In West Pakistan, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won 86 seats but none in East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:44]</a>. These results highlighted a deep divide between the two parts of Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:53]</a>. Although the Awami League won the election due to East Pakistan's larger population and seat allocation, the political elites in West Pakistan were unwilling to allow a party that won no seats in their region to form the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:15:13]</a>.

Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the PPP leader, met with army officials and General Yahya Khan to discuss canceling the National Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:26]</a>. On March 1, 1971, the cancellation of the election results was announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:36]</a>. This sparked uproar in East Pakistan, with people questioning how democracy could be overturned simply because the higher-ups disliked the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:54]</a>. Roads were filled with massive protests, and calls for freedom emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:59]</a>. East Pakistanis demanded autonomy to form their own country, believing West Pakistan was uninterested in electing their leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:16:06]</a>. This marked the foundation of the Bangladeshi Liberation War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:09]</a>.

By this point, Islam was no longer seen as a unifying factor; Bengalis prioritized their Bengali ethnicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:16]</a>. They aimed to create a Secular, Democratic, Socialist state based on Bengali ethnicity, leading to the name "Bangladesh" (Country of the Bengali people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:30]</a>.

### Towards Liberation War

On March 7, 1971, following the cancellation orders, the Awami League initiated a Non-Cooperation Movement, refusing to oblige the West Pakistani government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:44]</a>. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a historic speech at a racecourse, stating, "People in Bengal want freedom. People in Bengal want to live. People in Bengal want their fundamental rights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:17:00]</a>. Slogans like "Victory to Bengal!" and "This revolution is for our Freedom! This revolution is for our Independence!" were raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:14]</a>.

Tensions escalated between Bengalis in East Pakistan and Urdu-speaking Biharis, who were perceived as pro-West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:39]</a>. Attacks on Bihari communities occurred during protests, which the Pakistani army used as an excuse to intervene in March 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:51]</a>. The Pakistani army recruited some pro-Pakistan Bengalis for their operations, as not all East Pakistanis desired independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:18:02]</a>. The Jamat-e-Islami political party and its supporters, for example, supported the West Pakistani government and collaborated with the Pakistani army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:12]</a>.

Between March 10 and 13, 1971, Pakistan International Airlines flights were urgently rerouted to Dhaka, transporting Pakistani soldiers disguised as civilians for a planned operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:31]</a>. Bengali nationalists had formed their own independent army, the Mukti Bahini (Force of Independence), which conducted guerrilla operations against the Pakistani army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:50]</a>. The Indian Army contributed by providing training in guerrilla warfare to the Mukti Bahini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:59]</a>.

In response, West Pakistan formed the East Pakistan Central Peace Committee, known as Shanti Bahini, which committed extensive war crimes, including killing thousands of civilians, violating women, and targeting intellectuals like teachers, scholars, and social activists (called Budhhijivi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:23]</a>. Law and order collapsed in East Pakistan, and Bengalis stopped complying with instructions from West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:34]</a>.

On March 25, 1971, the West Pakistani government launched "Operation Searchlight," a heinous genocide targeting popular figures demanding Bangladesh's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:47]</a>. On the night of March 25, thousands of Pakistani Army troops marched into Dhaka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:54]</a>. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested and taken to West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:59]</a>. Before his arrest, he declared East Pakistan an independent country, renaming it Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:20:09]</a>. This declaration, transmitted via a transmitter, led to March 26th being celebrated as Bangladesh's Independence Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:24]</a>. On March 27, 1971, Major Ziaur Rahman publicly read this declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:30]</a>.

The same night, two student dormitories in Dhaka were attacked, resulting in the murder of 7,000 students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:43]</a>. Within a week, Operation Searchlight massacred over 30,000 Bengalis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:47]</a>. Half of Dhaka's population fled, foreign journalists were deported, and radio operations were shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:57]</a>. Pakistani journalist Anthony Mascarenhas fled to the UK and published an article in the Sunday Times on June 13, 1971, exposing the genocide, bringing the oppression in Bangladesh to global attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:15]</a>. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was motivated to act after reading this article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:21]</a>.

Many Awami League political leaders fled to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:29]</a>. On April 10, the People's Republic of Bangladesh government was formed in exile in Kolkata, with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared President and Tajuddin Ahmad as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:42]</a>.

### India's Role and the 1971 War

The conflict significantly impacted India, with over 10 million refugees crossing the border into India in the autumn of 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:54]</a>. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi considered military intervention more economically feasible than supporting 10 million refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:22:04]</a>. On April 28, 1971, she directed General Sam Manekshaw to prepare for war and enter East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:20]</a>. Though initially hesitant about India's readiness, General Manekshaw was given autonomy and began training the Mukti Bahini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:42]</a>. By July 1971, Indira Gandhi stopped referring to East Pakistan as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:51]</a>.

On December 3, 1971, Pakistan launched "Operation Chengiz Khan," attacking several Indian airfields (Amritsar, Pathankot, Jodhpur, Ambala, Agra, Srinagar, and 11 others) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:14]</a>. Pakistan feared India's military interference to aid Bangladesh's independence and decided to attack first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:13]</a>. Indira Gandhi announced on the radio that a war had been struck against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:31]</a>. The Indian Air Force retaliated, marking the beginning of the 1971 India-Pakistan War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:38]</a>.

India's strategy involved a defensive military stance in West Pakistan and a coordinated offensive thrust into East Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:35]</a>. Pakistan appealed to the United Nations for a cease-fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:41]</a>. On December 4, the UN Security Council debated, with the USA favoring Pakistan and the Soviet Union favoring India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:55]</a>. The US, China, and the UK supported an immediate cease-fire and troop recall, but the Soviet Union vetoed the resolution twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:24:07]</a>. The UK and France later abstained from voting, considering the atrocities against Bengalis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:10]</a>.

On December 6, 1971, Bhutan became the first country to officially recognize Bangladesh, followed by India on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:25]</a>. By December 12, Pakistan was facing defeat in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:29]</a>. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, flew to New York to discuss a cease-fire with America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:40]</a>. However, by the time a proposal was finalized, Pakistan's military in East Pakistan had already surrendered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:55]</a>.

### Birth of Bangladesh

On December 16, 1971, the Indian Army surrounded Dhaka, giving the Pakistani Army 30 minutes to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:25]</a>. Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi surrendered without resistance, and the government of East Pakistan collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:36]</a>. The historic Instrument of Surrender was signed on this day, with over 93,000 Pakistani troops surrendering to Indian and Bangladesh Liberation forces, marking the largest surrender since World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:52]</a>.

The following year, in 1972, the Simla Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:57]</a>. Under this agreement, Pakistan recognized Bangladesh as an independent country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:26:01]</a>. In return, India promised to release the 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war over five months and return 13,000 km² of land occupied in West Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:23]</a>. In 1974, the United Nations recognized Bangladesh as an independent country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:35]</a>.

In Pakistan, Yahya Khan's dictatorship collapsed, and Bhutto was sworn in as the new President on December 20, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:51]</a>. As per the Simla Agreement, Mujibur Rahman was released from prison and returned to Dhaka as a hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:57]</a>. In the 1973 Bangladeshi elections, he won with a landslide majority, and his Awami League party came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:27:06]</a>.

## Post-War Challenges in Bangladesh

Despite the newfound independence, Bangladesh faced challenges similar to Pakistan's past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:18]</a>. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a secular leader, banned all political parties formed on religious grounds, including Jamat-e-Islami, after coming to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:32]</a>. However, on August 15, 1975, he and his family were assassinated, with only his two daughters surviving as they were in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:45]</a>. In 1975, General Ziaur Rahman seized power through a military coup, portraying the military as heroes and revoking the ban on Jamat-e-Islami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:28:06]</a>. Bangladesh remained a military dictatorship for several years instead of a secular democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:13]</a>. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's daughter, Sheikh Hasina, came to power in 2009 and remains the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh, with the Awami League as the ruling party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:24]</a>.

The [[historical_context_of_language_and_economic_discrimination_in_bangladesh | influence of language imposition]] and the unequal treatment of Bengalis by West Pakistan are significant lessons from this history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:47]</a>. The geographical and cultural differences between the two regions also made unity challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:29:00]</a>.

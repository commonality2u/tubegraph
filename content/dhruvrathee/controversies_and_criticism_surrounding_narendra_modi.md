In 1996, psychologist Ashis Nandy interviewed [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]] for several hours. Nandy was deeply shaken by what he discovered about Modi's mentality [00:00:12]. Nandy later stated that [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]] falls under the diagnostic category of a "F@scist" and exhibits traits of an authoritarian personality, including puritanical rigidity, strict adherence to moral or religious codes, a constricted emotional life, fear of one's own passion, and a huge ego that conceals inner insecurity [00:26:40].

## Shifting Stances and Contradictory Policies

[[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Narendra Modi]]'s political image has been subject to significant scrutiny, particularly regarding his perceived shifts in ideology and contradictory statements.

### Post-Gujarat Riots Branding
Following the 2002 Gujarat riots, [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Narendra Modi]] was accused of many charges, though he eventually received a clean chit [00:03:11]. This period led to the branding of "Communal [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Narendra Modi]]" – an unwavering Hindu against all Muslims [00:03:19].

### Contradictory Positions on Religious Issues
Despite his public image as a devout Hindu, [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Narendra Modi]] exhibits contradictory behaviors:
*   While making speeches criticizing "mutton and fish" during Sawaan, his party has accepted donations from Halal Beef Exporting Companies via electoral bonds [00:03:47].
*   He is criticized for ignoring the demands of Swami Sanand, an environmentalist concerned about the River Ganga, who died after a 111-day hunger strike, only expressing condolences via Twitter posthumously [00:04:02].
*   Questions are raised about his concern for Hindus, citing the suicides of farmers, the sexual exploitation of over 2,900 women in Prajwal Revanna's videos (including Hindu women), and the lack of support for Hindu female wrestlers protesting against Brij Bhushan Singh [00:04:22].
    *   [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | PM Modi]] had asked people to vote for Prajwal Revanna and later gave an election ticket to Brij Bhushan Singh's son [00:04:59].
*   [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Narendra Modi]] frequently uses Hindu-Muslim narratives in speeches to appeal to a segment of the population that prioritizes Muslim distress over other societal issues like women's safety, education, or employment [00:05:24].
    *   He has suggested identifying "problematic elements" by their clothes [00:05:32].
    *   Amit Shah has claimed that [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Narendra Modi]] "taught the Muslims a lesson" in 2002 [00:05:44].
    *   In Rajasthan, he gave speeches spreading hatred against Muslims, specifically referring to "those who have more kids" and "intruders" [00:05:58].
*   However, in other contexts, [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Modi]] has presented himself as a secular leader:
    *   In Bihar, he claimed he would "not let the country be divided on religious lines" [00:06:13].
    *   At an Aligarh rally, he stated that Congress and Samajwadi Party did nothing for Muslims [00:06:27].
    *   In a May 14 interview, he declared that the day he uses Hindu-Muslim politics, he would "cease to be fit for a public life" and promised to avoid religious exploitation in politics [00:06:46].
    *   In 2014, [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | Narendra Modi]] tweeted, "Secularism is in our blood" [00:07:17].
    *   In 2020, Amit Shah stated that the BJP does not see India as a Hindu nation and follows the Constitution, ensuring freedom of religion for all [00:07:22].
    *   [[Narendra Modis political journey and roles | PM Modi]] has also praised Islam and Prophet Muhammad, emphasizing peace and the integral role of minorities in India [00:07:46].
    *   He has spoken about growing up celebrating Eid and participating in Muharram processions [00:07:59].

### The "Relationship" Strategy
[[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]] frequently asserts a "special relationship" with various communities, regions, and even concepts to forge emotional connections and garner votes [00:08:18]:
*   Sikhism: Seen wearing a turban and serving langar in Gurudwaras [00:08:22].
*   Lord Buddha: Claims a "connection" with Buddha [00:08:37].
*   Bohra Muslims: States an "old relationship" with the Bohra community [00:08:49].
*   Christians: Describes his relationship with the Christian community as "old and personal" [00:08:56].
*   Tribals: Claims to have spent an "important period of his life" among tribals [00:09:08].
*   Geographical regions: Asserts emotional relationships with Balia and Punjab, and a "special relationship" with China [00:09:16].
*   France: Claims his "affection for France is not new" [00:09:35].
*   Yaduvansh: States a relationship with the Yaduvansh [00:09:47].
*   Bengal: Falsely claimed to have visited the Kolkata Metro as a child, despite it opening when he was 34 years old [00:09:51]. He also stated a desire to be reborn in Bengal [00:10:12].
*   Promises to make Odisha and Karnataka the "number one" states, depending on the audience [00:10:20].

### Policy Contradictions and Unfulfilled Promises
[[Criticisms of Modis claims and portrayal | Narendra Modi]]'s political campaigns have often been criticized for making grandiose promises that remain unfulfilled or for contradictory policy stances:
*   **Cow Slaughter vs. Beef**: While the BJP uses the "holy cow" to emotionally manipulate voters in Uttar Pradesh, promising to stop cow slaughter, they have promised "quality beef" in Kerala and stated no plans to ban beef in Goa [00:10:50].
*   **Demonetization**: Initially touted as a "surgical strike against black money" in 2016, it is no longer used as a campaign point [00:11:26].
*   **Farm Laws**: Praised as a "historic achievement" for farmers, they were later repealed, which was then branded as a "masterstroke" by pro-government media; neither the laws nor their repeal are now used for votes [00:11:34].
*   **Farmers' Income**: The promise to double farmers' income has not been addressed [00:11:50].
*   **Corruption**: His 2014 slogan, "Neither be corrupt, nor allow others to be," and the promise of a "pure" Parliament are no longer mentioned [00:11:54].
*   **Inflation**: Despite criticizing previous governments for inflation, his administration does not seek votes for controlling it [00:12:06].
*   **Namami Ganga Project**: Despite calling himself the "son of River Ganga," the Namami Ganga project is not a campaign highlight [00:12:26].
*   **Other Abandoned Initiatives**: Initiatives like "Make in India," "Adarsh Gaon," "Smart City," "Bullet Train," "₹1.5 million (black money)," "Skill India," "Mudra Loan," "Look East Policy," "millions of jobs," "women empowerment," "Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao," "corona," and "Agniveer" are largely absent from current election posters [00:12:33].

[[Criticisms of Modis claims and portrayal | Narendra Modi]] has avoided press conferences and unscripted interviews for the last 10 years, despite challenges for an open debate [00:13:03].

## Centralization of Power and Loyalty System

[[Narendra Modis image and cult of personality | Narendra Modi]] has been likened to Aurangzeb for his ability to strategically align with or sideline individuals within the political landscape [00:13:30].

### Sidelining Political Opponents and Critics
*   Within the BJP, he reportedly ousted Shankar Singh Vaghela and Keshubhai Patel [00:13:51].
*   He isolated Lal Krishna Advani after initially getting close to him when Atal Bihari Vajpayee asked Modi to follow ethical governance [00:14:00].
*   Jaswant Singh was denied a ticket in 2014 [00:14:10].
*   Murli Manohar Joshi was shifted constituencies in 2014 and later sidelined in 2019 [00:14:14].
*   Sushma Swaraj was initially excluded from key foreign policy discussions and dropped from cabinet committees [00:14:37].
*   Nitin Gadkari was dropped from the BJP's Parliamentary Board after praising both Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Jawaharlal Nehru as ideal leaders [00:15:00].

### Rewarding Loyalty
[[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]]'s system heavily rewards loyalty, often disregarding qualifications or past criticisms:
*   **Nirmala Sitharaman**: Joined BJP in 2006, became Defence Minister in 11 years, and then Finance Minister in 2019 [00:15:18].
*   **Smriti Irani**: Despite previously threatening an indefinite strike over Gujarat riots if Modi didn't resign, she reconciled, lost elections in Amethi, but was appointed HRD Minister and later Women and Child Development Minister [00:15:33].
*   **Ashwini Vaishnav**: An IAS officer who became a Rajya Sabha MP in 2019, and then given three ministries (Railways, Electronics, IT and Communications) just two years later [00:15:55].
*   **Jyotiraditya Scindia**: Left Congress in 2020, leading to the collapse of the Madhya Pradesh government, and was immediately made a Rajya Sabha MP and Civil Aviation Minister the next year [00:16:10].
*   **Politicians Accused of Corruption**: 23 out of 25 politicians accused of corruption had charges cleared after joining BJP [00:16:21].

### Influence Across Institutions
The "reward-punishment" model extends to various national institutions:
*   **Judiciary**:
    *   Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi, who presided over cases with major government stakes and passed many judgments favoring the government, was given a seat in the Rajya Sabha four months after retirement, criticized as a "quid pro quo" [00:16:44].
    *   Supreme Court Judge Arun Mishra openly praised [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | PM Modi]], calling him a "versatile genius and internationally acclaimed visionary" [00:17:04].
*   **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**: RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan was not given a second term, and Urjit Patel and Viral Acharya later resigned, following clashes with the government [00:17:13].
*   **Election Commission**: Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa was removed from the Election Commission after refusing to give a clean chit on [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | Narendra Modi]]'s hate speech in 2019. The Chief Justice of India was also removed from the Selection Panel for Election Commissioners [00:17:24].
*   **Bureaucracy**: The lateral entry scheme was introduced for private sector individuals to be appointed to high government posts [00:17:48]. Lokesh Chandra, who stated "Modi is greater than Gandhi" and "He is God," was appointed head of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations [00:17:58].
*   **Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC)**: B-grade filmmaker Pahlaj Nihalani, known for his "Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi" statement, was appointed chairman of CBFC, leading to many issues during his tenure [00:18:07].
*   **Educational Institutes**: Gajendra Chauhan, a B-grade film actor who campaigned for Modi, was appointed Chairman of FTII Pune despite a list of more qualified filmmakers suggested by the I&B ministry, leading to a 149-day student strike [00:18:21].
*   **Media**: Media outlets that question the government face raids (NDTV, News Laundry, BBC India, The Wire), while "Godi Media" (pro-government) receives government advertisements and exclusive interviews [00:18:57].
*   **Companies**: Companies that donate to the government are favored with business opportunities, even if they have track records of adulterated medicines or structural collapses [00:19:28]. Adani, described as an "old friend," has benefited from government contracts ranging from airports to coal [00:19:41].
*   **Culture and Sports**: Propaganda filmmakers like Vivek Agnihotri and Sudipto Sen receive free publicity and National Awards [00:19:45]. Jay Shah, Amit Shah's son, heads BCCI despite lacking apparent qualifications in cricket or public speaking [00:20:03].
*   **Social Media**: Critics are banned, blocked, harassed by the IT cell, or labeled as "traitors" [00:20:41]. Loyalists are invited on stage, rewarded with National Creators Awards, and even followed on Twitter by [[Narendra Modis public image and psychological profile | PM Modi]], despite some using foul language against figures like Ambedkar [00:21:00].

## Self-Obsession and Cult of Personality
[[Narendra Modis image and cult of personality | Narendra Modi]] has been criticized for cultivating a cult of personality centered around himself:
*   The Sardar Patel Stadium was renamed after [[Narendra Modis image and cult of personality | Narendra Modi]], with its ends named after Ambani and Adani [00:23:31].
*   He has been observed manipulating photo opportunities, ensuring he is always in the frame and moving others out of the way [00:23:46].
*   At the Ram Mandir inauguration, he was the sole central figure, contrasting with the Akshardham temple inauguration which featured multiple dignitaries [00:24:39].
*   His photos and quotes are displayed prominently at historical sites like Gandhi Darshan Museum, Gandhi Smriti Centre, and Khadi Gramodyog, often overshadowing Gandhi himself [00:24:44].
*   Posters honoring Olympic medalists feature a large photo of [[Narendra Modis image and cult of personality | Narendra Modi]] alongside the athletes [00:25:11].
*   Numerous government schemes, roads, and hospitals are named after him (e.g., Namo Kisan Samman Diwas, Narendra Modi Medical College) [00:25:19].
*   He frequently engages in staged photo shoots (with ducks, peacocks, at beaches, gyms, safaris) [00:25:34].
*   His photo is printed on free food bags and COVID vaccine certificates [00:25:50].

According to Prashant Kishore, the BJP aims not just for votes but for "full control of your mind" and "psychological dominance," expecting citizens to "worship them" and dictate their choices [00:26:07]. This hunger for power and control leads to an unwillingness to face criticism, labeling critics as "traitors," and ensuring that [[Narendra Modis image and cult of personality | Narendra Modi]] and his allies are "beyond people's criticism" [00:27:24].

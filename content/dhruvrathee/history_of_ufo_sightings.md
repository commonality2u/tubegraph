In July 1947, a widespread "UFO craze" captivated America, with people across the country reporting sightings of "flying saucers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This phenomenon began on June 24, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen nine shining UFOs near Seattle, flying at speeds of 2,000 km per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Within two weeks, similar reports surged nationwide, heavily discussed in the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Media outlets linked these sightings to atomic sites, noting concentrations of UFO reports in areas of nuclear testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The [[roswell_incident_analysis | Roswell Incident]]

Amidst the UFO craze, a New Mexico man named Mac Brazel found unusual debris in his field, consisting of tin foil, rubber, and a thin wooden beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Wondering if it related to the UFOs, he took the debris to the Roswell Sheriff on July 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This caught the attention of Colonel William Blanchard, commanding officer of the Roswell Army Airfield (RAAF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The next day, RAAF released a statement confirming that "the rumours of the flying disks had come true," and the 509th Bomb Group of the 8th Airforce was "fortunate enough to gain possession of a disk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. However, the very next day, US Army Officials retracted their statement, claiming the debris was from a weather balloon, presenting photos of Major Marcel with the pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The news then subsided, and public interest waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Resurgence of Theories

Years later, in the late 1970s, rumors of an alien craft crashing in the New Mexico desert, struck by lightning and killing its occupants, began to spread again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. In 1980, Major Marcel, who had been photographed with the supposed weather balloon debris, wrote a book titled "The Roswell Incident," claiming the debris he saw was "from nothing made on this Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Since then, the significance of the [[roswell_incident_analysis | Roswell Incident]] grew, leading to new theories. Some claim a living alien was discovered in the UFO crash and is held by the US Army at a secret base, where efforts are underway to reverse-engineer alien technology and research alien life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This secret location is widely believed to be [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]] and Public Fascination

[[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]] is a highly restricted US Military facility located in the remote Nevada desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Trespassing is strictly prohibited, with signboards warning of "deadly force" against suspicious activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Bob Lazar and the "Storm Area 51" Event

In June 2019, Bob Lazar, a figure who believes in UFOs, was a guest on Joe Rogan's podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Lazar claimed to have worked as a researcher at [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]], tasked with reverse-engineering alien technology to improve modern technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Inspired by this podcast, college student Matty Roberts created a Facebook event titled "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All Of Us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The event suggested people gather at [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]] at 3 AM on September 20, 2019, to infiltrate the facility, humorously suggesting using the "Naruto Run" to dodge bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Despite being a prank, over 2 million people confirmed their attendance by August end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Matty Roberts, fearing the event had grown too large, issued a statement disavowing responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Due to [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]]'s isolated location in the desert—near the village of Rachel (population 54) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, and within the vast Nevada Test and Training Range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>—travel to the site was challenging. On the day of the event, only about 6,000 people arrived, transforming it into a peaceful "Alienstock" music festival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. No one attempted to enter [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]], though the event cost the local sheriff's department around $300,000 in police presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

## Historical Explanations for UFO Sightings

The true history of [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]] dates back to the Cold War, when it was established as a secret testing and development facility for aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. In the 1950s, the U-2 spy plane, designed for high-altitude reconnaissance against the Soviet Union, was tested there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The U-2 could fly 4,800 km at an altitude of 21,000m, largely undetected by radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

After a U-2 was shot down in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, the military developed the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird at [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This aircraft, still the fastest-flying, reaches speeds of 3,400 km/h and altitudes of 24,000m <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The secrecy surrounding these crucial planes during the Cold War led the CIA to exploit UFO conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. By allowing people to believe the unidentified, fast-flying objects were alien saucers, the true nature of the secret military aircraft was hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This is why the initial Roswell report was quickly allowed for a day before being retracted, preventing public outcry over aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The re-emergence of UFO rumors in the 1970s coincided with Blackbird SR-71 testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

In 1994, the US Air Force revealed that the debris from the [[roswell_incident_analysis | Roswell Incident]] was actually from a nuclear surveillance balloon, a spy device from Project Mogul, designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. However, the government's repeated misstatements eroded public trust, causing skepticism even after the truth was revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Many UFO sightings can be attributed to these high-flying, unconventional-looking military aircraft, especially during sunset when sunlight reflects off them, making them appear as "unidentified flying objects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The US Air Force's Project Blue Book cross-referenced UFO reports with flight records, explaining away a majority of sightings in the late 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

Bob Lazar's claims about Element 115 powering alien spacecraft were disproven when Russian scientists produced the element (Moscovium) in 2003, confirming it does not create a gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Furthermore, Lazar's educational background, including a supposed MIT degree, was found to be fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

## [[government_stance_on_ufos_and_uaps | Government Stance on UFOs and UAPs]]

In June 2013, the CIA publicly acknowledged the existence of [[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]] and declassified secret details of its history under the Freedom of Information Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This release included the exact location of the base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. In January 2017, 13 million pages of declassified documents, including records of UFO sightings and CIA experiments, were released online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Thousands more documents on UFOs were declassified in January 2021, with the agency claiming all records are now public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Today, the US [[government_stance_on_ufos_and_uaps | government]] avoids the term "UFO" due to its association with aliens, instead using "UAP" (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. In December 2020, the US [[government_stance_on_ufos_and_uaps | government]] directed the National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense to release all UAP records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. In April 2020, the US Pentagon released three videos, acknowledging leaked 2007 and 2017 footage as real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. An UAP Task Force was created in August 2020 to detect, analyze, and catalog UAPs, which are considered potential threats to national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. While many UAPs are eventually identified as weather balloons or other known objects, some remain unexplained due to insufficient data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. It is believed that these unidentified objects are part of highly classified programs by various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

[[public_curiosity_and_conspiracy_theories_about_area_51 | Area 51]] continues to be a site for testing next-generation aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. It has also become a global sensation and a tourism draw for Nevada, which renamed a highway the "Extraterrestrial Highway" in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. However, it remains a military facility, and trespassing is illegal, leading to arrests and jail time, as seen in the case of YouTuber Ties Granzier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

The nature and [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | impact of media on social behavior and norms]], particularly comedy, have come under scrutiny following a major controversy involving YouTubers Ranveer Allahbadia and Samay Raina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. An "obscene and tasteless question" posed by Ranveer Allahbadia sparked a nationwide uproar, leading to multiple FIRs, statements from Chief Ministers, a PIL in the Supreme Court, and the removal of all episodes of Samay Raina's show, *India's Got Latent*, from YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## The Controversy and Public Reaction

The controversy began when Ranveer Allahbadia asked an "obscene and tasteless question," which quickly escalated into a national debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This question, along with the "crass comedy" prevalent in Samay Raina's show *India's Got Latent*, drew widespread criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>. Both Ranveer and Samay began receiving death threats publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>, with some individuals calling for their "encounter" or stating they have "no right to live in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:06">[02:51:06]</a>. Ranveer's house was visited by police on February 14th, and he later issued an apology on Instagram, admitting his comment was "insensitive and disrespectful" and expressing genuine sorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. He also stated he was receiving death threats and that people were trying to hurt his family, even pretending to be patients to visit his mother's clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:04">[02:21:04]</a>. Samay Raina similarly tweeted about the difficulty of handling the situation and removed all episodes of *India's Got Latent* from his channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:03">[02:34:03]</a>. Maharashtra's Cyber Cell filed cases against 30-40 guests who appeared on the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:02">[02:44:02]</a>.

## The "It's Just a Joke" Defense

A common argument from supporters of vulgar comedy is that "it's just a joke" and should be treated as such, telling critics "not to be too woke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:03">[03:15:03]</a>. This defense extends to films and songs, where creators claim "it doesn't matter because it's just a film" or "it's just a song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:08">[03:40:08]</a>. However, the truth is that these forms of media do matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:03">[03:52:03]</a>. Every person is a product of their environment, and minds, especially those under 18, are very fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>. If films, songs, web series, jokes, and YouTube videos did not matter, a child would carry their ideology from birth, which is not the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:07">[04:05:07]</a>.

## Influence of Vulgarity on Society

Vulgar and profane content has a tangible [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | impact on social behavior and norms]]:

*   **Normalization of Objectification and Misogyny**: The explicit objectification of women, as seen in instances like Elvish Yadav and Kapil Sharma's comments about "Russian salesgirls" or "Russian for ₹6,000," directly translates into real-life harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This includes incidents where foreign women in India were targeted with the "₹6,000" comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Calling women derogatory terms like "b*tch" or "gold digger" reinforces harmful stereotypes set by toxic masculinity and normalizes such language against women, leading to its use in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. This ties into the broader [[representation_of_violence_and_misogyny_in_films | representation of violence and misogyny in films]].
*   **Mocking Vulnerable Groups**: Jokes that mock people's weight, height, complexion, financial status, or disability shatter the self-image of millions and contribute to real-life bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Similarly, joking about the poor or the death of children dehumanizes them and normalizes callousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.
*   **Shock Value and Rage Baiting**: Many "dank humour" jokes or offensive statements are primarily designed to shock the audience, making them share the content, increasing views and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This is akin to "rage baiting," intentionally saying or doing something to provoke anger, a tactic also used by [[impact_of_reality_tv_shows_on_society_and_mental_health | tasteless reality TV shows like Bigg Boss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

### Societal Repression and Appeal of Vulgarity

The popularity of vulgar comedy and songs can be attributed to societal repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. Many people, particularly teenagers, learn about intimacy through secretive means like pornography, leading to a perspective filled with guilt and awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. When basic [[role_of_religion_in_society | sex education]] is avoided in schools or films about it are given adult ratings, repression persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. Vulgar comedy then appeals to this repression, as creators understand that using profanity will be appreciated by this repressed audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. This leads to a "competition of who can be more vulgar" across various entertainment industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

## Hypocrisy of Critics

The controversy also highlights the hypocrisy of various societal actors:

*   **Filmstars**: Accused of being busy selling tobacco products disguised as cardamom, they are content with token tweets on national holidays rather than making inspiring films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Their argument is "it's just a film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This reflects on the wider [[celebrity_influence_on_public_perception_and_behavior | celebrity influence on public perception and behavior]].
*   **Government and Law Enforcement**: While an "obscene joke" leads to police action, serious threats and criminal acts on social media often go unpunished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. The government is criticized for turning "law and order into a joke," with criminals appearing on shows like Bigg Boss without consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   **Media**: Media channels are criticized for focusing on trivial matters like celebrity controversies or "IIT Baba" updates, rather than pressing national issues such as environmental concerns, challenges faced by marginalized communities, or farmer strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. They are seen as opportunists who criticize content creators only when it suits their agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

## Solutions and Ethical Considerations

The solution to vulgar comedy is not a ban, as government-imposed censorship is often more harmful than beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Historically, meaningful and sensitive films or stories have faced censorship while vulgar ones get a pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Instead, the following are proposed:

*   **Self-Censorship**: Creators should exercise self-censorship based on their conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Public Call-Outs and Boycotts**: People have the democratic and constitutional freedom to express dissent by calling out problematic content and creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Boycotts, where individuals choose not to watch or engage with such content and encourage others to do the same, are a democratic way to show dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. However, a boycott should not transform into a demand for a ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Condemnation of Threats**: Insulting, threatening, or advocating violence against creators is entirely wrong and illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Strict action should be taken against those issuing death threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This also relates to [[critique_of_violence_in_cinema_and_its_societal_effects | critique of violence in cinema and its societal effects]].
*   **[[comedy_ethics_and_the_distinction_between_punching_up_and_punching_down | Punching Up vs. Punching Down]]**: In [[comedy_ethics_and_the_distinction_between_punching_up_and_punching_down | comedy ethics and the distinction between punching up and punching down]], comedians should focus on "punching up" – mocking those in power or societal norms that benefit elites – rather than "punching down" – humiliating the disadvantaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Examples of comedians like Gaurav Kapoor, Abhishek Upmanyu, Manik Mahina, and Kunal Kamra demonstrate that meaningful and humorous comedy can be created without relying on cheap thrills or excessive vulgarity, even if some use foul language in addition to their core humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Creator Responsibility**: Content creators, including actors, filmmakers, and YouTubers, are urged to create content without profanity and vulgarity, as it is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Channels like Slayy Point and comedians like Deepak Garg and Hustling Rajan are examples of those who create comedy without resorting to such cheap thrills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Audience Responsibility**: Audiences also share responsibility to be discerning about the content they consume, recognizing that "your mind is not a dustbin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

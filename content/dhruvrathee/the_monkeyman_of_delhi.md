The "Monkey-Man" was a mysterious creature that caused widespread panic and terror in Delhi and its surrounding areas during the summer of 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>. The phenomenon, which led to numerous reported attacks and even deaths, is often cited as a classic example of [[theories_and_descriptions_of_the_monkeyman | mass hysteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.

## Initial Incidents
The first reported attack occurred on April 5, 2001, in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, where Anil Gopal was sleeping on his rooftop due to frequent power cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Around 2 AM, he was jolted awake by an attacker, suffering scratches on his arms and legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. He described seeing a monkey-like figure disappear into the dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Two weeks later, on April 18, another incident occurred in his neighborhood where Vinod was attacked while sleeping on a rooftop at 3:15 AM, also claiming to have seen a creature resembling a monkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The following night, Raihasuddin was badly injured in his hut by a similar creature, requiring 21 days to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Over the next few days, numerous cases of similar attacks, involving scratches, injuries, and bites, spread across Delhi and its neighboring areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>. The mysterious being was widely reported as being "half monkey and half human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:42">[02:01:42]</a>.

## Description of the Monkey-Man
The descriptions of the Monkey-Man varied significantly among victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>:
*   Early descriptions suggested it was more human-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Ajay, an early victim, described it as fair-complexioned with blue eyes and a big nose, believing it to be of Nepali origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   Later victims described it as more monkey-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Some said it was 8 feet tall and broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, others 4-5 feet tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, and some even compared it to a housecat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Popular descriptions claimed the Monkey-Man wore a helmet, a t-shirt with three buttons (one to turn him into a monkey, one for super strength, and one for invisibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   It was said to have long, sharp, metallic nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, red eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, and the ability to jump 20 feet between roofs, possibly due to springs on its feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Some even described electric currents running through its arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

Over time, the [[theories_and_descriptions_of_the_monkeyman | description of the Monkey-Man]] became increasingly supernatural, leading people to believe it was a shapeshifter that intentionally changed its appearance to mislead them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Widespread Panic and Consequences
Between April and May 2001, Delhi Police received about 100 calls reporting Monkey-Man attacks from over 65 locations across Ghaziabad, East Delhi, Noida, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Each report followed a similar pattern: a sudden attack on someone sleeping outdoors, followed by the creature's immediate disappearance, leaving only scratches, injuries, and bite marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

The terror led to tragic outcomes:
*   Three people lost their lives due to the panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   One person died after jumping off a rooftop to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   A pregnant woman died after slipping on stairs out of fear, having only seen a shadow she mistook for the Monkey-Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   Dozens suffered fractures from trying to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The widespread paranoia also led to the formation of vigilante groups armed with sticks and weapons to patrol areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:43">[07:11:43]</a>. These groups attacked innocent people, mistaking them for the Monkey-Man. Incidents included a man attacked by 150 people who was later found innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, a van driver whose bones were broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, and a man attacked by his own brother who mistook him for the creature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Police Response and Decline of Incidents
The Delhi Police faced challenges due to the lack of a consistent description of the Monkey-Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. They produced two sketches based on victim accounts, both portraying the Monkey-Man as more human than monkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

To combat the rising incidents, the police deployed over 3,000 officers to hotspots at night and ensured uninterrupted power supply in these areas, as power cuts were a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. On May 17, former Delhi Police Commissioner Ajay Raj Sharma announced a â‚¹50,000 reward for information leading to the Monkey-Man's capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

After May 25, 2001, the incidents slowly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. The Delhi Police began taking strict action against those making fake calls and spreading rumors, warning that such actions would lead to imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It was discovered that 303 out of 379 calls received by the police were fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Several individuals were arrested for spreading false rumors, including a doctor who inflated a surgical glove, painted it brown, and threw it from his balcony, claiming it was the Monkey-Man's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The arrests prompted people to stop reporting false sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Eventually, the media lost interest, and the incidents stopped completely within weeks and months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## [[theories_and_descriptions_of_the_monkey_man | Theories and Explanations]]

### Mass Hysteria
Psychologists categorize the Monkey-Man phenomenon as [[theories_and_descriptions_of_the_monkey_man | Mass Hysteria]] or Mass Psychogenic Illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. This is a phenomenon where a group of people exhibit unusual, irrational behavior, believe in illogical things, and experience irrational feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>. It spreads rapidly, especially in tightly-knit communities like those in India where neighbors and extended family live close by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. Triggers can include stress, anxiety, environmental, and psychological factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.

Doctors S.K. Verma and D.K. Srivastava of Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in New Delhi investigated 397 calls about Monkey-Man attacks and found only 51 worthy of medical examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>. Their 2003 study, published in the Indian Journal of Medical Sciences, concluded that the Monkey-Man case was a typical example of [[theories_and_descriptions_of_the_monkey_man | mass hysteria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>.

According to them, the trigger was often a shadow or a random sound at night, which, combined with existing fear, spread like a virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

Several factors contributed to the rapid spread of panic and fear:
*   **High Population Density**: Incidents took place in densely populated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.
*   **Socio-Economic Status**: 94% of the victims were from poorer sections of society and lower socio-economic statuses, often living in East Delhi's poorest locales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. People with less education tend to be more superstitious and imaginative, easily believing made-up stories when surrounded by others who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>.
*   **Media's Role**: The [[fake_news_in_indian_media | Indian media]] played a crucial role in spreading the "virus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. In 2001, newly established private news channels were competing for viewership by sensationalizing news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>. People eager for media attention fabricated stories, claiming to have seen the Monkey-Man to appear on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>. At the time, people were naive and blindly believed everything shown on news channels, unlike today's skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>. The police also blamed the media for the mass hysteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.
*   **Psychological and Environmental Stress**: Cases of [[theories_and_descriptions_of_the_monkey_man | mass hysteria]] are common among those under psychological or environmental stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>. Two-thirds of Monkey-Man attacks were reported on men aged 20-30 in low-income, stressful jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. The summer heatwave and frequent power cuts added to their environmental stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:49">[01:49:49]</a>.

### Real Injuries and False Reports
Investigations by Delhi Police and doctors confirmed that the injuries were real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>. However, doctors concluded that they were caused by rodents and stray dogs (for bite marks) or blunt objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. Many scratches were likely sustained when people, jolted awake during power cuts, ran in panic and collided with objects or fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.

The Indian Rationalist Association suggested some cases were "Mass Self-Delusion," where attention-seeking individuals intentionally inflicted injuries to gain media attention and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>. Delhi Police also suspected that many calls were simply a tactic to get electricity restored in areas facing power cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>. They noticed that once power was restored, the situation would calm down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

## Cultural Impact and Similar Phenomena
The Monkey-Man incident was depicted in the film *Delhi 6*, starring Abhishek Bachchan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>.

Other examples of [[theories_and_descriptions_of_the_monkey_man | mass hysteria]] or similar phenomena include:
*   **Spring-Heeled Jack (England, 1837-1904)**: Reports of a man in a trench coat with red eyes and metal nails scratching women, with no trace ever found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>.
*   **Braid Chopping Incidents (India, 2017)**: Women in Haryana and Delhi reported fainting and waking up to find their braids chopped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

These incidents often share common factors: occurrence in less educated, poorer communities with low socio-economic status, prevalent superstition, psychological and environmental stress, and the significant role of rumors and media in spreading fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.

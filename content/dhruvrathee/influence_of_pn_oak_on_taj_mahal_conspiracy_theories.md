Purushottam Nagesh Oak, also known as P.N. Oak, is identified as the individual who originated the [[controversies_about_taj_mahal_being_a_hindu_temple | conspiracy theory]] regarding the Taj Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## P.N. Oak's Background and Methodology
P.N. Oak was not a historian but rather a history enthusiast who enjoyed writing his version of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. His methodology for historical research differed significantly from that of professional historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. For instance, he would assert that if a word sounded similar to a Sanskrit term, it was probable that the related place had once been a Hindu temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. He would then present these probabilities as truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## Claims Related to the Taj Mahal
Oak's central claim about the Taj Mahal was that it was actually a Shiv Temple named Tejo Mahalaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

He argued:
*   The Taj Mahal was not built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   It was originally built in the 13th century by Raja Paramardi Dev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   This structure then passed down to Raja Maan Singh and was later acquired by Shah Jahan from his grandson, Raja Jai Singh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   He cited that Shah Jahan had acquired Raja Jai Singh's palace, taking a single line from actual [[history_of_the_taj_mahal | history]] and fabricating the rest with imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   Initially, Oak suggested the Taj Mahal was an ancient Hindu wonder, but after historians refuted this by explaining that buildings from before the 4th century only survived if carved from rock, he revised his claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He then asserted it was built in 1155 by Raja Paramardi Dev's Chief Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### Other Broad Claims by P.N. Oak
To illustrate his unique approach to history, P.N. Oak made other similar claims:
*   The Vatican was once a Hindu temple because "Vatican" sounds similar to the Sanskrit word 'Vatika' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   Westminster Abbey was also a Hindu temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   Christianity is actually "Chrisn-Nity" (ideology of Hindu deity Krishna), claiming Jesus Christ visited India between the ages of 13 and 30 to learn Krishna's ideologies, thus making Christianity inspired by Hinduism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   Islam and Judaism also originated from Hinduism, suggesting Abraham sounded like Brahma, Sarah like Saraswati, and Moses like Mahesh (Shiv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   He believed the entire world was once ruled by an ancient Hindu empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

## Legal Actions and Dismissals
In 1989, Oak published a pamphlet titled *Taj Mahal: The True Story* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Based on this pamphlet, he filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in court in 2000, seeking to "know the truth" behind the Taj Mahal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. The Supreme Court dismissed his petition, deeming it a "misconceived notion" and even ridiculing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

## Legacy and Spread of Theories
Despite judicial dismissals, P.N. Oak's fictional tales gained new life with the rise of social media platforms like WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. These stories, repeatedly forwarded, led people to believe them as true accounts, resulting in fresh petitions being filed in courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This phenomenon has contributed to the ongoing [[influence_on_indian_media_and_political_environment | debate]] and discussion on TV, treating these debunked theories as mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

His theories have continued to fuel discussions, including the [[debate_over_22_closed_doors_of_the_taj_mahal | calls to open the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal]] in search of Hindu idols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This persistent circulation of his theories highlights his lasting, albeit controversial, influence on the narrative surrounding the Taj Mahal.

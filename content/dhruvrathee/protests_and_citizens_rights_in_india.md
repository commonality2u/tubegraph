In a true democracy, the right to protest is considered a fundamental aspect of citizen accountability, especially when government entities are not transparent or responsive through other means like the Right to Information Act (RTI) or media scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>. This right enables citizens to hold their elected representatives accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. However, recent trends in India raise [[challenges_to_indian_democracy_and_opposition | concerns about the preservation of this right]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Suppression of Protests

There have been increasing instances where citizens attempting to protest peacefully have been met with severe government responses. Such actions have led to questions about the nature of democracy in the country, with some suggesting a move towards [[concerns_about_dictatorship_in_india | dictatorship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

Examples of such responses include:
*   **Tear Gas and Rubber Bullets** Protesters have been "welcomed" with tear gas and rubber bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Physical Barriers** Roads have been blocked or dug up to prevent protesters from advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37:00">[26:37:00]</a>.
*   **Drones for Tear Gas Deployment** Drones have been used to deploy tear gas against protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>.

These measures have been likened to a "war zone," with comparisons drawn to national borders, where such extensive arrangements are typically absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

## Notable Protests and Government Responses

### Farmers' Protests
Farmers have repeatedly taken to the streets to voice their demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>. In recent protests, they faced measures like sharp nails embedded in roads, dug-up routes, rubber bullets, and tear gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>. There have been reports of at least three farmers losing their sight due to rubber bullet injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>. During a previous farmers' protest, an article from 2021 reported that at least 600 farmers lost their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>.

### Wrestlers' Protest
The wrestlers' protest also saw similar behavior from the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:00">[27:18:00]</a>.

### Uttar Pradesh Coaching Centre Guidelines
In Uttar Pradesh, the government issued a rule banning coaching centers from holding classes for girls after 8 PM, citing [[security_issues_in_india | safety concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>. This was seen as an attempt to restrict girls rather than address the threats to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>. Public protests against these rules led to the UP government withdrawing the ban, demonstrating the power of public action in a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>.

## Unreported Protests

Many protests go unreported by mainstream media. Examples include:
*   Kashmiri Pandit protests lasting over 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>.
*   Government employees protesting against the old pension scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>.
*   A protest in Hisar that continued for over 400 days against the closing of the Doordarshan Kendra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.
*   Doctors' protests and protests by unemployed youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>.

The lack of media coverage for such significant events prevents citizens from being fully informed, impacting their ability to make free and fair decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.

## Implications for Citizens' Rights

The continuous suppression of protests and limited accountability from the government suggests a potential erosion of democratic principles. If citizens are unable to express dissent or demand accountability through peaceful protests, it implies a weakening of their rights. The current trajectory raises concerns that India could move towards a state where democracy exists merely on paper, similar to regimes like North Korea or Russia, where elections are held but genuine democratic freedoms are absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Citizens are urged to remain vigilant, as the treatment meted out to current protesters could apply to anyone seeking to defend their rights against unjust government decisions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:05:00">[28:05:00]</a>.

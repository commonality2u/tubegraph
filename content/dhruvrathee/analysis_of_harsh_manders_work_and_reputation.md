## Misinformation and Criticisms
Despite his extensive public service and contributions, Harsh Mander has been a target of misinformation campaigns, particularly by certain YouTubers and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

### Alleged Links to George Soros
One persistent false claim is that Mander works with [[george_soros_and_conspiracy_theories_and_funding | George Soros's Open Society Foundation]] and is involved in a plot to overthrow the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. The claim of a direct connection between Mander and Soros's Open Society Foundation is described as "creative imagination for nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Alleged Influence on YouTubers
Another false claim suggests that Mander influences YouTubers' content, specifically regarding videos on the CAA and Manipur. For instance, it was falsely claimed that a video on the Manipur riots was inspired by Mander's tweet on August 4, 2023, two days before the video's publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Similarly, a video on CAA and NRC was falsely linked to a tweet by Mander on December 14, 2019, alleging a "toolkit" influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. These claims were refuted by demonstrating that the YouTube videos were either published earlier or were part of broader discussions on widely publicized national issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

### Mistaken Identity and Defamation
Some critics have misidentified Harsh Mander with "Captain Harmandar Singh," attributing his parents' employment with the British police in Tanzania to Harsh Mander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This confusion is highlighted by the misspelling and disrespectful naming of Mander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Such misrepresentations could lead to legal action for defamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

### Accusations of Anti-Nationalism
Despite his significant contributions to Indian society and governance, Mander has been labeled "anti-national" by some critics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. This label is often applied to individuals who voice [[controversies_and_criticism_surrounding_narendra_modi | criticisms of Modi's claims and portrayal]] or express views that diverge from certain political narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

Overall, the information presented paints a picture of Harsh Mander as an accomplished former civil servant, author, and human rights advocate whose work has been intentionally misrepresented by some individuals in online spaces.

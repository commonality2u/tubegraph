[[unemployment_crisis_in_India | Unemployment]] has become the biggest issue in India, with 1 out of 3 youths unemployed according to the India Employment Report 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The unemployment rate for graduates is as high as 29.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite India being the 5th largest economy, aspiring to become a $5 trillion economy, there is a severe shortage of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The government's role in addressing this crisis is critical, encompassing policy implementation, educational infrastructure, and support for various economic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Government Promises and Reality
Prime Minister Modi had promised millions of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, some media channels, like ABP News, have "fact-checked" this, claiming the promise was never made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Despite election campaigns from parties like BJP Haryana focusing on jobs and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, Haryana, for example, reached the highest unemployment rate in the country at 37.4% by December 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Government initiatives like "Make in India" were launched with the aim of creating local employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, and the Prime Minister has spoken of creating jobs for "more than a billion young hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Media's Role and Blame Game
[[medias_role_in_questioning_government_actions | TV news channels often avoid discussing unemployment]] or protect the government's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Some commentators, like Sudhir Chaudhary, have shifted blame to citizens, suggesting people seek government jobs primarily for bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a> and that youth are not skilled enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, indirectly questioning the efficacy of programs like "Skill India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. They also suggest that youth are lazy for preferring fixed-hour government jobs over other forms of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Educational Infrastructure and Skill Development
A major barrier to employment is the lack of sufficient educational infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. While millions of students are eligible for higher education annually (around 33-34 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, college seats are extremely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Medical Education**: There are only about 108,000 MBBS seats in the country, with over 2 million applications for NEET UG in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Many private medical colleges have prohibitively high fees, with median annual fees around ₹1.15 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, making it unaffordable for 90% of Indians who earn less than ₹25,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Engineering Education**: Despite increasing population, the total number of seats in engineering colleges has decreased from 1.465 million in 2017-18 to 1.253 million by 2021-22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. A significant portion of these seats remain vacant due to high fees, low quality of education (sub-standard faculty, many without PhDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, faculty shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, and poor infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This leads to over 80% of engineering graduates being unemployable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs)**: While providing vocational skills, ITIs only offer around 2.5 million seats, with about 50% remaining vacant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Graduates also face challenges in finding jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

This highlights the government's responsibility in ensuring adequate and quality educational infrastructure for a large and aspiring youth population.

## [[impact_of_corporate_sector_on_job_availability | Corporate Sector's Impact and Government Policies]]
Even with a growing economy and profitable companies, the manufacturing sector has seen a 30% decrease in jobs from 51 million in 2016 to 36 million in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Major IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, HCL, and Tech Mahindra have had negative hiring numbers in October 2023, despite significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This trend suggests companies are maximizing profits by overworking existing employees rather than hiring new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Large corporations, despite enormous market capitalization and revenue, employ relatively few people. For instance, ITC, with a market cap of ₹54 trillion, employs only around 23,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Hindustan Unilever, with a turnover of ₹580 billion, employs only 21,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the handicraft market, which generates ₹320 billion in revenue and employs 6.9 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

The government's policy of reducing corporate tax from 30% to 22% in 2019 resulted in a loss of over ₹1 trillion in revenue within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, without significantly boosting employment.

## Promoting Informal Sector and Localized Production
The informal sector, though contributing only 50% to the National Product, employs 90% of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. Cooperatives and small and micro enterprises (SMEs) are crucial for generating large-scale employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. The decentralized economy and localized production are essential for job creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. While slogans like "Vocal for Local" are popular, the Prime Minister is criticized for not taking concrete action beyond these slogans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

## Government Actions to Address Unemployment
To solve [[unemployment_crisis_in_India | unemployment]], the government needs to take several key actions:
1.  **Fill Vacancies**: The central government has over 950,000 job vacancies, and state governments report over 6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Filling these would provide immediate relief.
2.  **Focus on Education**: Improve infrastructure in government schools, colleges, and institutes, and establish new ones to increase seat capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
3.  **Promote Cooperatives and SMEs**: The government must promote these sectors on a large scale, not just by providing loans, but also by ensuring means of production, storage space, and market mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. This approach was vital during historical economic crises in the US, China, and Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Examples from India's history, like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru setting up public sector undertakings and nationalizing banks, or the White Revolution, show the positive impact of government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
4.  **Support Small Businesses**: Instead of reducing corporate tax, the government should encourage small businesses by ensuring stable prices for essentials like gas and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

Ultimately, while individuals can learn skills and seek [[alternative_employment_opportunities_and_skill_development | alternative employment opportunities]], the primary responsibility for large-scale job creation and ensuring a conducive environment for employment lies with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

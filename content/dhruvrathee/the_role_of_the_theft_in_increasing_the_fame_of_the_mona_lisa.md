On August 21, 1911, a Monday morning in Paris, three men emerged from the Louvre Museum carrying a property of the museum hidden in a blanket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. They had spent the previous night inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. They escaped by catching an 8:45 AM train from a nearby railway station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Unbeknownst to the world, they had stolen the world's most famous painting, the Mona Lisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Theft of the Mona Lisa

The mastermind behind [[the_theft_of_the_mona_lisa_in_1911 | the theft]] was Vincenzo Peruggia, who, along with two friends, stole the painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Peruggia was an Italian Nationalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> who believed the painting belonged to Italy, not France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. His plan was to return it to Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Peruggia was an employee of the Louvre Museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. He hid in the museum one night, then simply walked out with the painting the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

The news of the theft made headlines globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Detectives were assigned to the case, but Peruggia eluded capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Discovery and Return

For two years, Peruggia kept the painting hidden at his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Eventually, he grew impatient and attempted to sell it to art dealer Giovanni Poggi in Florence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Poggi became suspicious and confirmed the painting's identity by checking its stamp, realizing he was being offered "the most wanted item in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. As a result, Peruggia was apprehended and sentenced to six months in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

The Mona Lisa was subsequently returned to the Louvre Museum and re-hung on January 4, 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Today, the painting is displayed behind bulletproof glass in strict climate-controlled conditions, with humidity maintained at 50% +/- 10% and temperature between 18°C and 21°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

> Perhaps the most interesting part in this story is that only after this theft did Mona Lisa's popularity start increasing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>

Before its theft, the Mona Lisa was not widely known or famous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. While art enthusiasts were aware of it, the general public was not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. It was only after [[the_theft_of_the_mona_lisa_in_1911 | the theft]] that the painting's popularity soared, transforming it into the world's most famous painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The popularity of the Mona Lisa, evidenced by the crowds surrounding it in the Louvre, can largely be attributed to Vincenzo Peruggia's audacious act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

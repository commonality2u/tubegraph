The results of the pre-medical exam, NEET (National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test for Undergraduates), declared on June 4th, 2024, have sparked widespread commotion across India due to numerous alleged irregularities and fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This exam is crucial for 2.3 million students who aspire to secure admission into good medical, dental, and AYUSH courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The integrity of the examination system is vital for ensuring a fair chance for every student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Background of Exam Misconduct

[[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | Paper leaks]] and misconduct in exams have become a common issue in India over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Days after the NEET 2024 exam, Patna police arrested 13 individuals for leaking exam papers, reportedly charging students ₹3 million to ₹5 million for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   On May 10th, 2024, an entire racket was uncovered in Gujarat, involving an education consultancy owner, a school teacher, and a BJP leader who allegedly charged students ₹1 million for exam assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   An investigation by The Indian Express revealed 41 [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | paper leaks]] in the last five years, impacting 14 million job seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

These issues have led to protests, which historically have been ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. However, the NEET 2024 controversy has escalated beyond simple [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | paper leaks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## NEET 2024 Irregularities

The NEET-UG exam is the sole undergraduate admission exam for medical, dental, and AYUSH courses in India, introduced in 2013 to replace various state and college-specific pre-medical tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. After 2019, the responsibility for conducting NEET exams was given to the National Testing Agency (NTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The NTA, established in November 2017 under the Ministry of Education, was hoped to bring transparency and independence to exam conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. However, public anger is now directed towards the [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Pre-Exam Anomalies
*   The registration deadline for NEET 2024, initially set for March 9th, was extended by a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   One month later, on April 9th-10th, the registration link was mysteriously reopened at the request of "stakeholders," followed by a correction window from April 11th-15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The identity of these "stakeholders" remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   Despite these extensions, reports of multiple [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | paper leaks]] from states like Gujarat, Bihar, and Odisha emerged even before the results were declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Unprecedented Perfect Scores
The NEET exam has a maximum score of 720 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In 2024, an unprecedented 67 students achieved a perfect score of 720/720, all receiving All India Rank 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This is highly unusual compared to previous years:
*   2023: Only 2 students scored perfect marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   2022: 4 students received AIR 1, but none achieved a perfect score, with the highest being 715 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   2021: 3 students scored a perfect 720 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### NTA's Explanations and Rebuttals
The [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] provided three reasons for the high number of perfect scores, all of which have been challenged:

1.  **Easy Exam**: An [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] official claimed the exam was very easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. However, students and experts, prior to the results, predicted a tough exam and a lower average score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  **Increased Candidates**: The [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] stated that 300,000 more candidates appeared in 2024 compared to 2023, naturally leading to higher scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
3.  **Grace Marks**: The most controversial reason, [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] admitted that 50 of the 67 toppers received grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   44 students received grace marks due to discrepancies in answer keys, specifically for a physics question with two correct answers depending on the NCERT textbook edition (old vs. new) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Critics question why a national exam would have such errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> and why grace marks were given for an outdated textbook edition for a simple physics concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   The remaining 6 students received grace marks due to time-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. These 6 toppers were part of 1,563 students who received grace marks for time loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Grace Marks Controversy

Several students scored 718 or 719 out of 720, which is technically impossible under the exam's scoring system (+4 for correct, -1 for incorrect, 0 for unattempted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. A score like 718 or 719 could only be achieved through grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Two such students were from the same Jhajjar Centre as the 6 toppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

[[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] claimed they awarded grace marks based on a 2018 Supreme Court judgment related to the CLAT exam for law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. However, this judgment explicitly states it cannot be used for engineering and medical exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This raises questions about how the [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] justified its use and the exact formula applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Critics allege this indicates corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

### OMR Sheet Discrepancies

The Junior Doctors' Network of the Indian Medical Association highlighted another issue: discrepancies between students' OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheets and their final scorecards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. For example, 18-year-old Arshita's OMR sheet indicated a score of 384, but her final result was 308, an 80-mark difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Strategic Timing of Results

Adding to the controversy, the NEET results were declared on June 4th, 2024, the same day as the [[indian_general_election_results_2024 | 2024 Indian General Election results]] were announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This timing led to accusations that the [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] was attempting to conceal the exam scam amidst the media's focus on the [[indian_general_election_results_2024 | election results]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Reactions and Demands for Justice

The Supreme Court has directed the [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] to provide answers, stating that "The sanctity of the exam has been affected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, Sanjay Singh, Akhilesh Yadav, and MK Stalin, are demanding an investigation and have vowed to raise the issue in Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Over 40,000 students have signed a petition demanding a re-examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Role of Government and Education Ministry

Despite widespread concerns about [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | paper leaks]] and irregularities in various exams, the government's perceived inaction is criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. India's Education Minister, Dharmendra Pradhan, who was reappointed after the [[indian_general_election_results_2024 | 2024 election results]], is criticized for seemingly prioritizing political messaging over addressing the education system's issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Latest Update and Impact on Students

Under pressure, the [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] announced on June 8th that the Education Ministry would establish a four-member panel to examine the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. As a partial resolution, the [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] has agreed to remove the grace marks given to 1,563 candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. These candidates now have the option to retake the exam or accept their scores without grace marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. However, the [[issues_with_national_testing_agency_nta | NTA]] has yet to address other problems like [[paper_leaks_and_misconduct_in_indian_exams | paper leaks]], inflated scores, and multiple toppers from a single center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

The ongoing [[effects_of_exam_fraud_on_students_and_education_system | exam fraud]] and irregularities take a significant toll on students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. In 2022, over 13,000 students committed suicide due to depression stemming from the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

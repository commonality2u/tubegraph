## Impact of the Corporate Sector on Job Availability

[[unemployment_crisis_in_India | Unemployment]] has become a significant issue in India, with reports indicating that one out of three youths is unemployed, and the rate reaches 29.1% among graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite India being a large market with 1.4 billion people and becoming the world's 5th largest economy, many companies generate substantial profits while job availability remains low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Corporate Profits vs. Job Creation

Foreign companies in India earn millions and billions in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For instance:
*   **PepsiCo**: Reported a yearly revenue of ₹80 billion in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola India**: Has a yearly revenue exceeding ₹128 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Despite these significant revenues, many young people in India struggle to find jobs even with a salary of ₹12,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The prevailing issue is that while the economy grows, jobs are not being created for the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Declining Manufacturing and IT Sector Employment

The manufacturing sector in India has seen a significant decline in job numbers:
*   In 2016, there were 51 million jobs in the manufacturing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   By 2023, this number had fallen to 36 million, representing a 30% decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The IT sector has also experienced job losses and negative hiring trends:
*   In May 2023, 6% of contract workers in India's IT sector lost their jobs in the March quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   Over 11,000 Indian startup employees were laid off by June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   A "layoff tsunami" in August 2023 saw tech companies fire over 200,000 employees globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   Major IT companies like TCS, Cognizant, and Wipro have not resumed campus hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   In October 2023, four out of the top five IT companies (Infosys, Wipro, HCL, and Tech Mahindra) reported negative hiring numbers, with only TCS showing positive growth of 523 staffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Despite this, these companies are not in loss; for example, TCS recorded a 9% year-on-year profit growth of ₹113 billion, and Infosys's quarterly profit before tax was ₹85 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### Corporate Practices and Job Growth

A clear pattern emerges: as companies grow beyond a certain limit, their job growth rate tends to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Companies often overwork existing employees instead of recruiting new ones to avoid increased salary expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This leads to high levels of workplace burnout, with India topping global charts at 62% of employees reporting exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Examples of large corporations with disproportionately low employee numbers relative to their market capitalisation or revenue include:
*   **Adani Group**: With a market capitalisation of ₹11 trillion, it employs only 43,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola**: Globally, its employee count nearly halved from 150,900 in December 2012 to 82,000 in December 2022, while its profits increased by hundreds of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Twitter**: With a market capitalisation of $41 billion (₹34 trillion), it employs only 1,500 people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **ITC**: Owning over 25 brands and having a market capitalisation of ₹54 trillion, it employs only around 23,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
*   **Hindustan Unilever**: With over 50 FMCG brands, a market capitalisation of ₹59 trillion, and an annual turnover of ₹580 billion, it has only 21,000 total employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

These examples highlight that private sector corporate jobs, especially white-collar jobs, are extremely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The problem is not primarily a lack of [[alternative_employment_opportunities_and_skill_development | skills]] among the workforce, but rather a shortage of available jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Contrast with Decentralized Economy

In contrast to large corporations, the informal sector and small-scale enterprises are significant drivers of employment:
*   The Indian handicraft market, with a size of $3.9 billion (₹320 billion) in 2022, employed 6.9 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This is 650 times more employment than a company like Hindustan Unilever, which has a higher turnover but employs significantly fewer people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   NITI Aayog reports indicate that while the informal sector contributes only 50% to the National Product, it employs 90% of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   Cooperatives like Lijjat Papad and Amul are credited with large-scale employment generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

This suggests that the decentralized economy and localized production fostered by cooperatives, shopkeepers, and small-scale businesses are crucial for job creation in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
The government reduced corporate tax from 30% to 22% in 2019, leading to a loss of over ₹1 trillion in one year for the country, which did not translate into increased employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. This highlights a need for government focus on supporting small businesses to foster job growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

On April 28th, 1988, [[Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident | Aloha Airlines Flight 243]], a routine 35-minute inter-island flight in Hawaii, experienced a catastrophic structural failure mid-air, bringing global attention to the critical issues of airplane structural fatigue and corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This incident served as a stark lesson, leading to significant [[aviation safety improvements post1996 | improvements in aviation safety procedures and regulations]] worldwide.

## The Mid-Air Catastrophe
The flight, departing from Hilo to Honolulu, was a routine operation for the Aloha Airlines, a local Hawaiian airline connecting various islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The specific Boeing 737 plane had already completed 8 flights that morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Shortly after take-off at 1:25 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, as the plane reached its cruising altitude of 24,000 feet, a sudden, loud bang was heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This was followed by rapid decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Passengers observed that about 35 square meters of the plane's front body, including the roof and surrounding walls, had disintegrated and blown away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The cockpit door was also missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The oxygen mask system failed, exposing passengers to hypoxia, strong winds nearing 500 km/h, and temperatures of -45Â°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Captain Robert Schomstheimer and First Officer Mimi Tompkins, whose oxygen masks were functional, initiated an emergency descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Despite the nose of the plane drooping and the possibility of the cockpit separating from the cabin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, they successfully navigated the damaged aircraft. Facing further challenges, including a failed left engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> and initial issues with the nose landing gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, the pilots managed to land the plane safely at Maui airport at 1:58 PM, 13 minutes and 42 seconds after the explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Of the 95 people on board, 58-year-old air hostess C.B. Lansing was the sole fatality, having been swept out of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Most passengers in rows 4 to 7 sustained serious injuries, while others had minor or no injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The fact that the seatbelt sign was still on and passengers were buckled in significantly contributed to the high survival rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Causes: Fatigue, Corrosion, and Maintenance Failures
The [[investigation_of_airplane_accidents | investigation]] conducted by America's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed critical insights into the incident's causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### Structural Weakness
The plane, a Boeing 737, had accumulated 89,680 flight cycles and 35,496 flight hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Its fuselage, made of aluminum sheet metal panels joined by lap joints, was found to be severely weakened by fatigue and corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

*   **Pressurization Cycles:** Each flight cycle involved the cabin being pressurized at altitude and depressurized on the ground, causing the metal sheets to expand and contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This constant stress led to material fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Lap Joint Design:** The Boeing 737 fuselage used overlapping panels secured by three rows of rivets and an epoxy glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The glue was intended to distribute stress across the panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   **Degradation:** High moisture content in the air, common in Hawaii, caused the epoxy glue to degrade and the metal to corrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This transferred the stress primarily to the rivets, which were not designed to bear the full load alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Manufacturer and Airline Responsibility
*   **Outdated Manufacturing:** Boeing had recognized the issue with the epoxy bonding method and switched to a "Hot Bonding" technique by 1972, 16 years before the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Warning Bulletins:** Boeing had issued service bulletins in 1972 and an "Alert Service Bulletin" in 1987, recommending inspection and repair of older planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **Tear Straps Failure:** Boeing's safety design included "Tear Straps" every 25 cm to limit any tears in the fuselage to a 10-inch by 10-inch square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. However, the extent of cracks in Flight 243 rendered these straps ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Aloha Airlines' Negligence:** The NTSB's final report cited Aloha Airlines management for not properly supervising maintenance programs and not assessing inspections and quality controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The airline falsely claimed to have used the "Eddy Currents technique" for crack detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   **FAA Oversight:** The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was partially blamed for not requiring thorough joint inspections when issuing Airworthiness Directives, despite Boeing's recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. Both Boeing and the FAA were seen as having taken the issues with the old bonding technique lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   **Exceeded Life Cycles:** The plane's design life was 20 years, with limits of 51,000 flight hours and 75,000 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Due to its use in short-distance flights, Flight 243 had accumulated nearly 90,000 flight cycles, far exceeding the recommended limit, making it prone to fatigue failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Legacy and Safety Improvements
The [[Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident | Aloha Airlines Flight 243 incident]] had profound and lasting effects on [[aviation safety improvements post1996 | aviation safety procedures and regulations]] globally, addressing the [[challenges_faced_by_boeing_in_aerospace | challenges faced by Boeing in aerospace]] and the wider aviation industry.

*   **Mandatory Inspections:** All of Boeing's older aircraft underwent re-inspection, revealing numerous similar cracks, confirming the widespread nature of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Aging Aircraft Programs:** In 1991, the FAA launched its "Aging Aircraft Safety Program," mandating inspections and control programs for all old aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Advanced Detection Techniques:** Crack detection methods in aircraft maintenance were permanently changed to rely on non-human-eye methods like Eddy Current and ultrasonic testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **High-Cycle Plane Regulations:** New rules were established for high-cycle planes, like those used for short-duration trips, requiring more frequent inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Legislation:** The U.S. government passed the Aviation Safety Research Act of 1988 to better understand and plan for the structural issues of aging aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

The incident profoundly transformed [[aviation safety improvements post1996 | aviation safety standards]] regarding structural integrity, ensuring that aircraft design, manufacturing, and maintenance protocols prioritize long-term structural health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. This has largely prevented similar catastrophic structural failures from occurring again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

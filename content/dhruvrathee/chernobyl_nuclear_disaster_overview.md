The Chernobyl nuclear disaster occurred on April 26, 1986, at 1:23 AM, at Reactor Number 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Workers realized that the nuclear reaction was completely out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. An emergency shutdown button was pressed, which was designed to insert control rods and prevent reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, the system did not work as designed, and after the control rods entered, a huge explosion occurred, engulfing the reactor in flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Harmful radioactive material rose into the air with the flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The amount of harmful radioactive material released was equivalent to 400 [[the_impact_of_atomic_bombings_on_hiroshima_and_nagasaki | Hiroshima atomic bombs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This event is still considered the World's Worst Nuclear Disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_chernobyl_disaster | radiation spreading through the air]] affected not only Ukraine but also much of Europe, from Spain to Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Radioactive rain fell in the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, leading to increased radiation in cow's milk and thousands of children developing thyroid cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Background

After World War II, the Soviet Union invested heavily in nuclear power plants, including the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:43">[01:57:43]</a>. Its official name was the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:29">[02:06:29]</a>. Construction began in the early 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:57">[02:10:57]</a>. Though named Chernobyl, the plant was located about 16 km away from the city of Chernobyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:44">[02:12:44]</a>.

The Chernobyl Plant was one of the Soviet Union's most advanced nuclear power plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>, featuring four nuclear reactors of the RBMK 1000 design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>. Each reactor could produce 1,000 Megawatts of electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:17">[02:44:17]</a>, with all four capable of supplying 10% of Ukraine's electricity demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>. The first two reactors became operational in 1977, the third in 1981, and the fourth in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>.

## How a Nuclear Reactor Works

[[technical_aspects_of_nuclear_reactors | Nuclear reactors]] generate electricity by moving a turbine with steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:39">[03:38:39]</a>. In nuclear energy, nuclear reactions heat water to produce steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:38">[03:48:38]</a>. Water also acts as a coolant to prevent overheating around the reactor, requiring a constant supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:15">[04:04:15]</a>. At Chernobyl, water came from a nearby man-made water reserve and a river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:28">[04:12:28]</a>.

The core of nuclear reactors is typically built from three main components:
*   **Fuel rods**: Contain nuclear fuel, such as Uranium Dioxide enriched with Uranium-235 isotope, which undergoes nuclear fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:16">[05:52:16]</a>. When a neutron collides with Uranium-235, it splits into two atoms, releasing additional neutrons and kinetic energy (which converts to thermal energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:19">[06:54:19]</a>. These extra neutrons collide with more atoms, creating a nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:15">[07:14:15]</a>.
*   **Control rods**: Made of Boron Carbide in Chernobyl's case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:01">[07:28:01]</a>. Boron absorbs neutrons, slowing down the nuclear fission reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:02">[07:32:02]</a>. The more control rods are inserted, the slower the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:20">[07:58:20]</a>.
*   **Moderator**: Graphite blocks were used as moderators in the RBMK 1000 reactors at Chernobyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:07">[08:05:07]</a>. Moderators help speed up the reaction by slowing down the energy of neutrons, increasing their chances of colliding with Uranium atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:15">[08:08:15]</a>. Most modern nuclear plants use water as a moderator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:21">[08:22:21]</a>.

## The Fateful Test and Its [[causes_of_the_chernobyl_disaster | Causes]]

The disaster at Reactor Number 4 took place during a routine safety test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:42">[02:57:42]</a>. The test aimed to determine if the turbines could produce enough electricity to power the water pumps in the 1-2 minute gap before backup diesel generators started during a power cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:08">[04:28:08]</a>. This test had never been successful in Reactor Number 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:05">[05:21:05]</a>.

Preparations for the test began at 11:10 PM on April 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:56">[05:39:56]</a>. Workers were instructed to reduce the reactor's power output from 1,600 MW to 700 MW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:21">[09:25:21]</a>. However, upon inserting the control rods, the power unexpectedly dropped significantly, reaching as low as 30 MW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:10">[09:35:10]</a>. This was due to the accumulation of Xenon-135, a byproduct of nuclear fission, which, like Boron, efficiently absorbs neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:07">[09:48:07]</a>. This accumulation of Xenon in the core, known as Xenon poisoning, further slowed the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:39">[10:15:39]</a>.

To increase power for the test, the shift supervisor, Anatoly, ordered the removal of control rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:07">[10:31:07]</a>. By 1:00 AM on April 26, the power reached 200 MW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:48">[10:40:48]</a>. Still short of the 700 MW target, Anatoly ordered more control rods to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:30">[10:51:30]</a>. Out of 211 control rods, only 8 remained in the reactor, violating safety protocols that mandated a minimum of 15 control rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:34">[10:58:34]</a>.

## Explosions and Immediate Aftermath

The sudden removal of control rods at 1:19 AM caused an abrupt power surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:38">[11:21:38]</a>. The little water remaining in the core turned into steam, reducing the coolant and creating a positive feedback loop where the reaction gained more speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:01">[11:31:01]</a>. The Xenon, which had been slowing the reaction, burned out as the power spiked, removing any remaining neutron absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:35">[12:16:35]</a>.

This led to an extreme power surge, with the nuclear reaction increasing exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:14">[12:27:14]</a>. The lid of the containment structure started shaking, and shockwaves were felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:02">[12:34:02]</a>. At 1:23 AM, workers pressed the Emergency Stop button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:17">[12:40:17]</a>.

However, a critical design flaw in the RBMK reactor's control rods led to disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:40">[13:02:40]</a>. While the main part of the control rod was Boron, the tip was made of graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:05">[13:07:05]</a>â€”the same material used as a moderator to *speed up* the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:40">[13:19:40]</a>. As the control rods were inserted, their graphite tips caused an infinite speed-up of the already runaway reaction, reaching 33,000 MW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:05">[13:23:05]</a>.

The first blast occurred 6-8 seconds after the emergency button was pressed, causing the reactor core to melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:08">[13:43:08]</a>. Two to three seconds later, an even more powerful blast blew the 1,000-tonne lid into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:27">[13:52:27]</a>. This second explosion was reportedly caused by the burning of graphite within the reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

Two people were instantly killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>, and more than 100 radioactive elements and 5% of the 192 tonnes of Uranium fuel were released into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Fire alarms rang at 1:26 AM, and firefighters arrived, initially unaware of the scale of the nuclear incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. The graphite fire took over 10 days to extinguish, requiring helicopters to drop thousands of tonnes of clay, sand, Boron, and lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. One helicopter crashed during this dangerous operation, killing four people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.

## Preventing a Third Blast

Even after the fire was extinguished, the reactor continued to produce high levels of heat, causing its base to crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. A water tank filled with radioactive water lay beneath the reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. Contact between the superheated reactor and the water would have instantly converted the water to steam, leading to a massive explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. This third potential blast was feared to be larger than the previous two and could have rendered almost the entirety of the European continent uninhabitable for 500,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

To prevent this, three heroesâ€”Alexei Ananenko, Boris Baranov, and Valeri Bezpalovâ€”volunteered to dive into the radioactive water tank on May 4, 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>. Wearing simple diving equipment, they located and opened the valves to drain the radioactive water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>. All three divers survived; Boris passed away in 2005 from a heart attack, while Alexei and Valeri are still alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

## [[aftermath_and_cleanup_of_chernobyl | Cleanup and Secrecy]]

Initially, Soviet Union officials used remote-controlled robots for cleanup, but they broke down in the high radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. Thousands of people, known as "liquidators," were sent to actively clean up the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. During 1986-1987, 200,000 liquidators were dispatched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. Firefighters who initially responded experienced radiation sickness symptoms, and about 28 died within a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. Those exposed to less radiation died in a couple of years or developed cancers within 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.

The Soviet Union government initially tried to cover up the incident due to the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. However, radioactive dust reached Sweden, where monitoring stations detected unreasonably high radioactivity levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. This forced the Soviet authorities to publicly admit the disaster on April 28, 1986, two days after the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. The local population was informed even later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

By May 2, 1986, a 30 km radius around the plant was declared an exclusion zone, a restricted area for all except scientists and government officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.

## Containment Structures and Current Status

To contain the radioactive waste, a temporary concrete and metal structure called the Sarcophagus was completed by November 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. As this structure deteriorated with rust and cracks after 28 years, construction of a new Safe Confinement began in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. This new structure, costing 3 billion dollars and taking 9 years to build, was completed in 2019 and is designed to seal off the reactor for the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>.

The remaining parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant continued operation until 2000 to meet Ukraine's power needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>. The dismantling process is ongoing and is expected to finish by 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. Approximately 2,400 people work at the plant, including guards for the exclusion zone, firefighters, scientists, technicians, and service staff, working two shifts a week due to high radiation levels and undergoing regular radiation monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>.

The 30 km exclusion zone, abandoned by humans, has been largely taken over by nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>. Large animals like wolves, deer, lynx, beavers, eagles, boars, and bears thrive there, some of which are endangered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>. While some deformities due to radiation have been observed, the impact on animal populations has not been major <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_the_chernobyl_disaster | Impact and Lessons Learned]]

### Health and Environmental Impacts
In addition to the initial deaths and radiation sickness among responders, a 2018 UN report noted 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer in children under 18 who lived through the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. This was largely attributed to radioactive dust, particularly Iodine-131, settling on pastures, being consumed by cows, and then transferred to children via milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. The trees in the area developed a red, ginger-colored tint, leading to the designation of the "Red Forest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.

### Economic and Political Impacts
The disaster cost the Soviet Union an estimated $235 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>, covering emergency response, cleanup, relocation of people, and environmental decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. Politically, it is considered a major reason for the breakdown of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.

### Global Lessons
Scientists worldwide began researching ways to prevent future nuclear disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>. A direct result of the disaster was the founding of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>. This international organization conducts safety checks on nuclear power plants globally and researches safety improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>. One significant improvement in modern nuclear reactors is the use of water as both a moderator and a coolant, preventing positive feedback loops seen in the RBMK design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.

The depiction of mental illnesses in media, particularly Hollywood films, often ranges from sensationalized and inaccurate to, in some cases, sensitive and well-researched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. These portrayals can significantly impact public perception and contribute to the stigma surrounding mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

## Sensationalism and Misrepresentation

Many films have historically sensationalized mental illnesses for entertainment purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This often involves portraying affected individuals in a scary, insensitive, or violent light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

*   **"True Story" Claims:** The 2005 Hollywood film, *The Exorcism of Emily Rose*, was marketed as "Based on a true story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, drawing from the real-life case of [[anneliese_michels_exorcism_and_mental_health | Anneliese Michel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. While the film depicted demonic possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, the actual case of [[anneliese_michels_exorcism_and_mental_health | Anneliese Michel]] was later determined by medical professionals to involve multiple mental illnesses, including temporal lobe epilepsy, anorexia nervosa, and hyper-religious personality disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Her parents' extreme religious upbringing was cited as influencing her delusions of being possessed by demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The film's approach contributed to the [[criticism_of_sensationalist_paranormal_media | criticism of sensationalist paranormal media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

*   **Violent Portrayals:** Films like *Aparichit* and Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho* are cited for portraying individuals with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) as extremely dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This contributes to the stereotype that DID patients are violent, despite research indicating that most are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

*   **Insensitive and Comedic Portrayals:**
    *   *Bhool Bhulaiya* features a character, Chhota Pandit (played by Rajpal Yadav), whose mental illness is used for comic relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
    *   The film also depicts a so-called psychiatrist treating the main character, Avni (played by Vidya Balan), with strange methods, including slapping, which would not be approved by real therapists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

### Impact on Stigma
Dr. Simone Reinders from King's College London notes that films portraying DID patients as violent and dangerous exacerbate the existing stigma associated with these illnesses in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. This can contribute to the [[role_of_media_in_spreading_mass_hysteria | role of media in spreading mass hysteria]] or misunderstanding around mental health conditions.

## Positive Portrayals and Accurate Therapy

While misrepresentation is common, some media has made efforts towards more accurate and sensitive portrayals:

*   *Karthik Calling Karthik* (starring Farhan Akhtar and Deepika Padukone) is highlighted as a film that depicted a DID patient in a sensitive and well-thought-out manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   The Haryanvi web series *Opri Paraai* is praised for accurately portraying the rules of psychotherapy, emphasizing the creation of an environment of safety, confidentiality, and trust for the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. It also showed real-life techniques like guided imagery and Bandler's handshake used in hypnotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

> "If someone has a heart problem, they go to a cardiologist. If someone has a mental issue, they should go to a therapist. This should not be about any person's ego." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>

It is crucial to understand that mental illnesses are serious health issues, and professional consultation with a psychotherapist is recommended for stress, anxiety, depression, or irritability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. The idea of "demons" or "evil spirits" influencing behavior is dismissed in favor of scientific explanations for conditions like Dissociative Identity Disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

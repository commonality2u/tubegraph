Antarctica stands alone as the only continent not recognized as a country, lacking a government or indigenous tribal populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its extreme conditions, including temperatures as low as -89Â°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, wind speeds up to 300 km/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, and its status as the world's driest continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> (considered a desert with only 51mm of rain, which falls as snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>), contribute to its minimal human influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Despite this, various countries have historically sought to claim parts of the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Origin of the Name

The name "Antarctica" has ancient roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Around 350 BC, Greek philosopher Aristotle suggested the Earth was spherical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The Greeks knew of the northern "Arctic" regions, named 'Arctos' after the Great Bear constellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Believing the Earth's poles to be mirror images, they theorized an unknown southern land and named it "Antarctos," meaning "antithetical to the bear" or "opposite of Arctos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This is where the name "Antarctic" originated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Early Expeditions and Mapping

Although humans first stepped on Antarctica in the 1890s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, it appeared on maps centuries prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Explorers, knowing land existed to the south but unsure of its size or nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, included it on maps, such as a 1530 French world map, where the large southern landmass was labeled "Terra Australis Incognita" (Unknown Southern Land) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

In 1773, British Naval officer James Cook was the first to cross the Antarctic Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. He got within 130 km of the continent before turning back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Though he didn't see Antarctica, observations of icebergs with rock deposits led him to conclude that Terra Australis did exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Cook famously declared:
> "I can be bold enough to say that no man will ever venture farther south than I have done, and that the lands which may lie to the south will never be explored." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>

## First Landings

Cook's prediction was disproven 50 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The identity of the first person to step on Antarctica remains controversial, with several individuals claiming the feat, including British-American Captain John Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

The first undisputed landing occurred in 1895, when the Norwegian ship *Antarctic* reached its shores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Six to seven crew members went ashore in a small boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Carsten Borchgrevink, a Norwegian, claimed he landed first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, while Alexander, a New Zealander on the same boat, asserted he was first to step out to steady the boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Heroic and Colonial Periods

The early 1900s (first 20 years) are known as the "Heroic years of Antarctica" due to numerous expeditions and new [[scientific_research_and_discoveries_in_antarctica | scientific discoveries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, including the discovery of plants like mosses growing on the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Following this, the "Colonial period of Antarctica" saw seven countries lay claim to sovereignty between 1908 and 1942: Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Other nations, including the USA, Soviet Union, Japan, Sweden, Belgium, and Germany, conducted explorations without claiming territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. During Hitler's rule in 1939, a German Antarctic Expedition dropped metal Nazi Swastikas to claim areas for Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

The USA's official position, announced in 1924 by its Secretary of State, stated that discovery of new land did not grant ownership; actual permanent settlements were required for a claim to be valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
> "if any country discovers new land in Antarctica, it doesn't mean that the new areas, would belong to the country. The land would belong to the country only when there are actual settlements in the area. When the citizens of that country live there permanently." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>

## Post-World War II Geopolitics

After World War II, territorial disputes intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Countries established permanent research centers to bolster their claims, with researchers living there permanently to demonstrate settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Examples include Australia setting up stations on Heard and Macquarie Islands (1947-48) and the Mawson station on mainland Antarctica (1954) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. France established bases on Kerguelen and Crozet Islands (1953) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, and Argentina set up the General Belgrano Station on the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (1955) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

The proximity of British, Chilean, and Argentinian bases clearly indicated their political, rather than purely [[scientific_research_and_discoveries_in_antarctica | scientific research]], motives, even suggesting intelligence activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Notably, the territorial claims of Chile, Britain, and Argentina overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

In 1950, the Soviet Union declared it would not recognize any claims or decisions regarding Antarctica made without its participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Amidst the Cold War, fears arose that geopolitical conflicts could extend to Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | The Antarctic Treaty]]

To prevent conflict, US President Eisenhower proposed a treaty in 1958 to ensure Antarctica remained peaceful and free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] was signed in Washington on December 1, 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Its three main points were:
1.  Antarctica would be used only for peaceful purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
2.  [[scientific_research_and_discoveries_in_antarctica | Scientific investigation]] would be open to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
3.  Results of scientific observations would be freely exchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

Initially signed by 12 governments, including all claiming countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, the treaty did not abolish claims but merely suspended them temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. These claims, such as Australia's claim to 42% of the continent, remain legally valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. However, the USA and most other countries reject these territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The seven claiming nations often do not recognize each other's claims, especially where they overlap (e.g., UK, Chile, Argentina) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India's Involvement]]

Initially, [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]] opposed the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]], fearing it would allow a few countries to exploit the continent, potentially for mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]] advocated for United Nations control over Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Despite its opposition, [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]] secretly launched its first expedition to Antarctica in December 1981, led by marine biologist Dr. Syed Zahoor Qasim, borrowing an icebreaker ship from Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The *New Scientist* magazine playfully titled its report "Indians Quietly Invade Antarctica" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This expedition was technically illegal as [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]] was not part of the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

In 1983, under pressure from Non-Aligned Movement countries, the UN General Assembly agreed to discuss Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. About a month before this meeting, [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]] surprisingly signed the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] and applied for Consultative Party status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Today, [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | India]] maintains two active research stations in Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. [[indias_involvement_with_antarctica | Indian]] scientist Sudipta Sengupta's research on the second expedition showed that the Schirmacher Hills on Antarctica's coast were part of a fault line once joined to the Indian subcontinent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## [[environmental_protection_and_mining_ban_in_antarctica | Environmental Protection and Mining Ban]]

In 1991, the [[environmental_protection_and_mining_ban_in_antarctica | Environmental Protection Treaty]], also known as the Madrid Protocol, was signed, imposing restrictions on drilling and mining activities in Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This was crucial due to significant oil reserves discovered, with estimates ranging from 19 billion barrels (US Geological Survey, 1992) to 500 billion barrels (Russian mineral explorers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. As of now, oil mining is prevented by the Madrid Protocol and the high cost of extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## The Future of Antarctica

The [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] is set to expire in 2048 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The future of its renewal is uncertain, especially as climate change makes Antarctica more accessible due to melting ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, potentially making resource extraction more economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Currently, challenges include overfishing and unregulated tourism. China, in particular, has expanded fishing and tourism and is the only country to have set up new research stations in Antarctica since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Illegal exploitation of nature by private yachts has also been reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. There are ongoing discussions for a new treaty to regulate the ocean around Antarctica to prevent overfishing and establish it as a protected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

The permanent headquarters of the [[antarctica_treaty_and_geopolitics | Antarctic Treaty]] was established in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. While Antarctica is not a country, it functions as a political territory where countries collaborate and share power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. However, it lacks a police force, army, or legal system, and loopholes in the treaty are still exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. For example, tourists can get passports stamped at British, Chilean, and Argentinian stations, which serves as a symbolic way for these countries to assert their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

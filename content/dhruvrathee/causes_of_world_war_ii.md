World War II is described as the most devastating war in human history, leaving numerous large cities crumbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Many geopolitical events and international relations today can be traced back to this conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is difficult to pinpoint a single event that sparked the conflict, as it was a series of conspiring events that eventually lit the flame of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Treaty of Versailles and its Aftermath
The story of World War II begins in 1919, the year World War I ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This treaty included Article 231, also known as the War Guilt Clause, which held Germany responsible for all losses caused by World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. France and Britain demanded heavy costs from Germany, seeking to recover their losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

As a result, Germany was ordered to pay a fine of $33 billion to other countries, which amounts to approximately $270 billion in today's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Germany made the final payment of this fine only in 2010, nearly 100 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The first payment in 1921 led to hyperinflation in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The German Mark rapidly devalued; a packet of bread costing 160 Marks in Berlin in 1922 cost 200 billion Marks by 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This crippled the economy and rapidly increased unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## [[rise_of_adolf_hitler | Rise of Adolf Hitler]] and Nazi Ideology
In these dire circumstances, [[rise_of_adolf_hitler | Adolf Hitler]] emerged as a young political leader skilled at manipulating the masses with his speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In 1923, Hitler's Nazi Party attempted a coup to overthrow the German government, which, though it failed, significantly increased Hitler's popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Rumours were spread that Germany's international humiliation was due to "anti-national" elements within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Hitler specifically blamed the Jews and Socialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Over the next decade, extensive propaganda, paid media organizations, and hate speeches were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The Great Depression in 1929 worsened Germany's unemployment situation, with 6 million people unemployed by 1933 and many homeless or starving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. As a result, in 1933, Hitler declared himself the Dictator of Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. After gaining control, Hitler pursued his dream of a German Empire (German Reich), aiming for a racially pure state inhabited only by people of the Aryan race, with no space for Jews and Slavs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. To fuel hatred, the Judeo-Bolshevism conspiracy theory was promoted, falsely claiming Jews caused the Russian Revolution of 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## German Rearmament and Early Violations
In 1935, the world discovered Germany had an air force, an open violation of the Treaty of Versailles, which had forbidden Germany from having any military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. However, many in Britain felt the Treaty of Versailles was unfair to Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. In June 1935, Britain signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, formally recognizing Hitler's authority to form his navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. France, alerted by Germany's growing militarization, built a 450 km long fortification on its Eastern border, known as the Maginot Line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Expansionist Policies and Appeasement
Once his military was sufficiently prepared, Hitler turned his attention to neighbouring countries:

*   **Austria (1938)**: Hitler sought to unite all German-speaking countries into one nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. His goal was to conquer countries not only for pride but also to acquire resources and provide "Lebensraum" (living space) for his Aryan race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. In February 1938, Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg was forced to sign an agreement allowing pro-Nazi individuals into the Austrian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. When the Chancellor decided to hold a national vote on Austria's independence, Hitler marched his army into Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The Chancellor resigned to avoid bloodshed, and Hitler's propaganda ministry spread fake news of riots by Communists, leading to the Austrian government "asking" the German army for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The Austrian Parliament was dissolved, and Austria ceased to be independent without bloodshed, partly due to the propaganda influencing many Austrians to favour Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Czechoslovakia (1938-1939)**: After Austria, Hitler targeted Czechoslovakia, specifically the Sudetenland region, where around 3 million Germans lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain sought to avoid war through appeasement, believing that giving Hitler what he wanted would maintain peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Munich Agreement was signed in September 1938, ceding Sudetenland to Germany on the promise of no further wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. However, less than a year later, in March 1939, Hitler violated the agreement and invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The German army easily won, splitting the country into German territory and a Nazi client state (Slovak Republic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Invasion of Poland and Declarations of War
Hitler then set his sights on Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. To secure this invasion, he signed a Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union in 1939, despite his animosity towards Communist ideology, as both nations wanted parts of Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

On September 1, 1939, nearly 1 million German troops invaded Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The UK and France, losing patience with Hitler's continuous invasions, issued an ultimatum: if Germany proceeded with the invasion of Poland, they would declare war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Hitler ignored it, leading the UK to officially declare war on Germany, followed by France, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### The Phony War and Blitzkrieg
This initial period was known as the Phony War, as despite declarations, no real military support was provided to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Poland's old-fashioned army, still using horses, was quickly defeated by Germany's military strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Within a week, by September 8, 1939, German troops occupied Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Subsequently, the Soviet Union also invaded from the other side, and Poland was partitioned between Nazi Germany and the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Hitler's revolutionary warfare strategy was **Blitzkrieg** (German for "lightning war"), which focused on speed and stealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This involved rapid tank invasions followed by air force (Luftwaffe) attacks, aiming to conclude wars quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. To maintain the speed of Blitzkrieg, German soldiers were given drugs like Pervitin (Crystal Meth) to reduce fatigue, hunger, thirst, pain, and boost confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Expansion into Scandinavia and Western Europe
The Soviet Union, concerned about Germany invading Finland (which was historically part of the Russian Empire), demanded Finnish territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Finland refused, leading to a Soviet military action that lasted over two months, ending in March 1940 with the Moscow Peace Treaty, where Finland ceded 11% of its land to the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Meanwhile, Hitler turned his attention to Norway and Denmark, invading them with his Blitzkrieg strategy on April 9, 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. These small countries quickly fell, with the Norwegian government fleeing to London to establish a Government in Exile, and Hitler setting up a pro-Nazi puppet government in Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Fall of Neville Chamberlain and the Battle of France
Neville Chamberlain resigned as British Prime Minister on May 10, 1940, due to his failure to protect neighboring countries from Nazi invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Winston Churchill became Prime Minister on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

Also on May 10, 1940, Hitler launched an all-out attack on France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. France had relied on its Maginot Line fortifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. In the Battle of France, Hitler's forces, consisting of over 1,000 fighter bombers and around 3 million soldiers, used a deceptive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. While Group B attacked the Netherlands and Belgium, and Group C attacked the Maginot Line as a distraction, Group A executed a master plan, sneaking into France through the supposedly impassable Ardennes Forest with over 40,000 military vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

On May 15, 1940, they captured Sedan and moved North, surprising British and French (Allied) troops in Belgium by attacking them from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

### The Dunkirk Evacuation
With Allied troops surrounded on three sides, their only escape was by sea near the port of Dunkirk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Nearly 400,000 Allied troops (British and French armies) were stranded on the beaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Winston Churchill launched Operation Dynamo on May 26, 1940, the biggest evacuation in military history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Despite intense firing from the German army on land and attacks from the German air force, around 350,000 soldiers were successfully evacuated by June 4, 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. However, most of the Allied military equipment was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

On June 22, 1940, France surrendered to Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Italy, under Dictator Mussolini, formed an alliance with Hitler known as the Pact of Steel, declaring war against France and Britain on June 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. By July 1940, Hitler's Germany had established control over Austria, Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. At this point, with a peace agreement with the Soviet Union, Hitler believed Britain was the only remaining opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. The United States was not yet involved, maintaining a stance of non-interference in Europe after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

The Pune Porsche accident case exemplifies how widespread public outrage, significantly amplified by [[Role of social media in spreading information | social media]], can pressure authorities and influence the course of justice in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## The Pune Porsche Tragedy: A Catalyst for Outrage

On the night of May 18th, 2024, a 24-year-old man, Aneesh, and a 24-year-old woman, Ashwini, were tragically killed when their motorcycle was struck by an electric Porsche Taycan on Kalyani Nagar Airport Road in Pune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The Porsche, driven by a 17-year-old boy named Vedant, was reportedly travelling at speeds between 160 kmph and 200 kmph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Vedant was underage and had been drinking alcohol at two clubs, Cosie and Blak, before the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The car was unregistered and lacked a number plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Initial Perceived Injustices

The immediate aftermath of the accident revealed several alarming irregularities that sparked public fury:

### Political Influence and VIP Treatment
Within an hour of the incident, MLA Sunil Tingre arrived at the Yerwada police station at 3 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Tingre stated he came to help the Agarwal family, whom he had known for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Reporters also noted what seemed like a "feast" at the police station, with pizzas being served <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Downgraded Charges
The First Information Report (FIR) against Vedant was filed under Section 304A (Death by Negligence), which carries a maximum punishment of 2 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Public and legal experts questioned why it wasn't filed under Section 304 (Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder), which suggests knowledge that an action could lead to death and has a maximum sentence of 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Given that driving drunk at 200 kmph is known to be fatal, the lesser charge raised suspicions of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Tampering with Evidence
Vedant's blood test, conducted 8 hours after the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, initially came back negative for alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It was later revealed that two doctors at the hospital, Dr. Ajay Taware and Dr. Shrihari Halnor, were bribed â‚¹300,000 to discard Vedant's real blood sample and replace it with another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Both doctors have since been arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Attempted Blame Shifting
Vedant's mother allegedly requested their driver to take the blame for the crash, and his grandfather reportedly threatened the driver to admit he was driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This attempt was thwarted by numerous witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Lenient Bail Conditions
The most shocking development was the Juvenile Justice Board's decision to grant Vedant bail within 15 hours of his detention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. As punishment, he was asked to study road safety rules, prepare a presentation, and write a 300-word essay on road accidents and their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## The Power of Public Outrage and Social Media

The news of the lenient bail conditions sparked a massive outcry across the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. People began expressing their fury on [[significance_of_social_media_in_promoting_communal_narratives | social media]], questioning the justice system and the perceived immunity of the rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

> [!quote] "A rich family's son, drives a Porsche under the influence of alcohol, and ends up k!lling 2 people, so he is told to write an essay." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
> "Has justice been reduced to a joke? For the rich, is the cost of our lives worth less than that of a cockroach?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>

This widespread public outrage led to significant shifts in the investigation and legal proceedings:

### Increased Police Action
Under immense public pressure, the police moved the Sessions Court on May 20th, requesting that Vedant be tried as an adult and that the charge be changed from Section 304A to Section 304 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. They also decided to book more individuals, including the owners and managers of Club Cosie and Blak restaurant for serving alcohol to a minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Arrest of Family Members
Due to continued pressure, an FIR was lodged against Vedant's father, Vishal Agarwal, under Sections 75 and 77 of the Juvenile Justice Act for willful neglect and supplying alcohol to a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Additional sections of the Motor Vehicles Act were cited for allowing Vedant to drive without a license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Vishal Agarwal attempted to evade arrest by purchasing a new SIM card but was apprehended in Aurangabad on May 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Re-evaluation by Juvenile Justice Board
On May 22nd, Vedant was again produced in the Juvenile Court, where Section 185 (driving under the influence of alcohol) was invoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The police reiterated their request for him to be tried as an adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, and Vedant was remanded to an observation home until June 5th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Legal Complexities and the Path Forward

The case highlights a legal technicality within the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. While the Act allows for individuals aged 16-18 to be tried as adults for "heinous crimes" (crimes with a minimum imprisonment of at least 7 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, Section 304 of the IPC, despite having a maximum sentence of 10 years, does not specify a minimum sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This loophole has previously allowed juvenile offenders in similar cases to evade adult trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

Despite these legal hurdles, the [[Protests and citizens rights in India | public outcry]] has been instrumental in pushing for a stricter interpretation and application of the law. There's a strong argument that juveniles from privileged backgrounds, who receive every advantage, should not be treated with the same leniency as children from disadvantaged environments who commit crimes due to lack of proper parenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

However, the subsequent arrests and intensified legal proceedings against the accused and their family demonstrate the undeniable power of [[Activism and raising political awareness through social media | collective public voices]] and [[Role of social media in spreading information | social media]] in demanding accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. As Dr. B.R. Ambedkar said, "Educate, Agitate, Organise," urging citizens to raise their voices against injustice and show the power of unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

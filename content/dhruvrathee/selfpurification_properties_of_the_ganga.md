The Ganga River has long been revered for its perceived spiritual and cleansing properties, with some reports even suggesting natural self-purifying capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. This concept often points to the presence of bacteriophages and other unique characteristics of the river's ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

## Claims of Self-Purification

Following criticism from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) regarding the [[water_quality_measurements_at_mahakumbh | water quality measurements at Mahakumbh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government issued a press release citing a report by a "scientist" named Dr. Ajay Sonkar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This report claimed that water samples from five ghats, including the Sangam, showed "no bacterial growth," attributing this to the Ganga's "self-purifying properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. It further suggested the presence of 1,100 types of bacteriophages, natural viruses that kill harmful bacteria, to explain the river's natural cleansing ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

## Scientific Perspectives

While the presence of bacteriophages in the Ganga is a known fact, and some research from 2020 indicates the river does possess self-cleaning properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>, more recent scientific studies offer a nuanced perspective:

*   **Bacteriophages and Microbial Control**: Bacteriophages are indeed natural viruses that can kill harmful bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. A 2021 article in *The Hindu* mentioned research titled 'Assessment of Water Quality and Sediment To Understand Special Properties of River Ganga,' which discussed the 1,100 types of bacteriophages found in the Ganga's water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. However, even a large amount of bacteriophages cannot eliminate all harmful microbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.
*   **Overwhelmed Capacity**: Research from 2020, while acknowledging the Ganga's self-cleaning properties, also stated that the current pollution load has significantly increased, to the point where the river's natural purification mechanisms are insufficient to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
*   **Unverified Research Claims**: The report by Dr. Ajay Sonkar, often cited by government bodies, has not been published in any known scientific journal, nor is its data publicly accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **IIT Delhi Findings**: In 2023, researchers from IIT Delhi published a paper in the *Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering*. After analyzing 16 water samples from Gomukh and other locations, they found a large number of disease-causing bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

## Government Actions and Discrepancies

The sudden promotion of Dr. Ajay Sonkar's unverified research by the government followed the NGT's criticism on February 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. On February 21st, the UP government issued a press release about this research, and by February 22nd, it was quoted by the BJP IT Cell's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. This rapid dissemination of unverified information, often through informal channels like "WhatsApp University," is unusual, as scientific research typically undergoes a 3-6 month peer-review process before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

The government's promotion of unverified research, while simultaneously refuting data from its own agencies like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), raises questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. If the river were capable of self-purification, it would also bring into question the necessity of the [[government_efforts_and_failures_to_clean_ganga | Namami Ganga Project]], on which over â‚¹400 billion has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

The truth is that the ongoing sewage and industrial waste discharge into the Ganga has severely hampered its natural ability to cleanse itself, leading to significant [[pollution_in_ganga_river_during_mahakumbh | pollution in Ganga River during Mahakumbh]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. The deadlines for cleaning the river have been repeatedly postponed, with the current target being 2026, though experts remain skeptical due to the government's perceived reluctance to acknowledge the extent of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

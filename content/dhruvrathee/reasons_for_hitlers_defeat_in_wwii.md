In July 1940, [[rise_of_adolf_hitler | Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler]] had occupied nearly all surrounding countries, including Austria, Poland, Norway, Belgium, Denmark, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Italy, led by dictator Mussolini, had formed an alliance with Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Broadly speaking, only three major countries remained in Europe: Germany, the Soviet Union, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A peace agreement existed between Germany and the Soviet Union, meaning Britain was the last European country opposing Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Initially, the United States remained uninvolved in the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. However, the situation eventually changed, leading to Hitler's defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Britain's Defiance and the Battle of Britain

Hitler believed that Winston Churchill would seek a peace treaty due to the stronger German army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, Churchill defied this expectation, delivering an iconic speech declaring that Britain would "never SURRENDER!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This meant the war against Germany would continue, prompting Hitler to attempt an invasion of the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Hitler planned Operation Sea Lion to invade Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. As there was no land connection, and the British Royal Navy had more ships, Hitler decided to establish control over the air space first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. On July 10, 1940, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe), with 2,600 aircraft compared to the UK's 700, attacked Britain by bombing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Their goal was to destroy aircraft, airfields, and manufacturing factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The smaller British Royal Air Force (one-fourth the size) defended their country, incurring heavy losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

On August 24, 1940, German pilots mistakenly bombed London, killing civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Churchill retaliated by bombing Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. In response, Hitler ordered an all-out decisive attack on London on September 15, 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. More than 1,000 German aircraft (620 fighters, 500 bombers) were deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The British Royal Air Force, with only 630 aircraft, successfully intercepted and crushed the waves of attack, downing over 60 Luftwaffe aircraft while losing only 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This day is known as the Battle of Britain Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This outcome was largely attributed to the British soldiers' higher motivation, as it was a matter of national existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The Battle of Britain Day marked one of Hitler's first major losses in [[causes_of_world_war_ii | WWII]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Recognizing the low chance of success, Operation Sea Lion was postponed, and Hitler shifted his focus to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Invasion of the Soviet Union: A Major Turning Point

Hitler's primary interest was in defeating the Soviet Union, believing it would compel Britain to sign a peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Despite a peace treaty, he harbored animosity towards communists and believed capturing a country as large as the Soviet Union was necessary for Germany to become the world's #1 superpower, driven by megalomania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. However, attacking the Soviet Union proved to be a major mistake and a [[impact_of_the_soviet_union_in_wwii | turning point in WWII]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Hitler's plan, akin to his invasion of France, involved dividing German forces into three parts: one towards Leningrad, another towards Moscow, and a third from the South through Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This operation, [[early_invasions_in_world_war_ii | Operation Barbarossa]], began on June 22, 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Although the Soviet Union had a larger army (20,000 tanks vs. Germany's 6,000), Germany possessed superior technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

To defend itself, the Soviet Union joined hands with Britain, becoming part of the Allied Powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Despite this alliance, Hitler's [[blitzkrieg_military_strategy | Blitzkrieg strategy]] allowed Germans to invade 100 km within two days, occupying a large amount of Soviet territory and reaching within 300 km of Moscow within weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

However, disagreements among Hitler and his military commanders delayed the German advance until October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The onset of winter then gave the Soviets an advantage, as they were accustomed to fighting in cold weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Furthermore, a non-aggression treaty with Japan allowed the Soviet Army to redeploy troops from the Eastern border to fight Germany in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### The Battle of Stalingrad

By mid-1942, Hitler focused on the Southern Soviet Union to disrupt supply chains from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This led to a devastating battle in Stalingrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The Soviet Union army successfully defended against the German army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. By November 1942, the winter months again made fighting difficult for the German army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Despite almost winning control, the Soviets continued fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The Battle of Stalingrad was the deadliest battle during [[causes_of_world_war_ii | WWII]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. In February 1943, nearly 300,000 German troops surrounded in Stalingrad surrendered to Soviet soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This was the biggest turning point in [[causes_of_world_war_ii | WWII]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Entry of the United States and Allied Offensives

In December 1941, Japan attacked the USA's Pearl Harbor base without provocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Over 2,300 American troops were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Until this point, America had avoided involvement in [[causes_of_world_war_ii | WWII]] after its experience in [[causes_of_world_war_i | WWI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. However, after Pearl Harbor, America officially declared war on Japan and entered [[causes_of_world_war_ii | WWII]], joining the Allied Forces, which included the UK, the Soviet Union, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This [[role_of_the_united_states_in_changing_wwii_dynamics | changed the dynamics of the war]].

In June 1942, the US attacked Japanese territories in the South Pacific in the Battle of Midway, destroying four important Japanese aircraft and supplier carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. By the end of 1942, the British Army successfully drove German and Italian forces out of Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## Germany's Decline on Multiple Fronts

Some months after Stalingrad, in July 1943, Italian citizens overthrew dictator Mussolini, leading to an anti-fascist movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Mussolini was executed by Italian partisans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. A new Italian government stopped fighting the Allied Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

Confidence among the Allied countries grew that they could defeat Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. In November 1943, Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill met in Tehran to discuss how to end [[causes_of_world_war_ii | WWII]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

### D-Day and the Western Front

On June 6, 1944, known as D-Day, the Allied Forces began Operation Overlord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. More than 150,000 British, American, and Canadian soldiers landed on Normandy beaches in France to fight the German army and liberate France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This marked the first time the British army was on the ground fighting Germans since the Dunkirk evacuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

This created a dangerous situation for Hitler, who was already facing losses on the Eastern Front due to the cold and inability to completely defeat the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Hitler decided to withdraw his army from the Eastern Front to focus on the Allied forces from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

### Soviet Counter-Offensive and Allied Liberation

As Hitler withdrew, the Soviets launched a major counter-attack, regaining about 600 km of territory within two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania came under Soviet Army occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Simultaneously, Allied Forces landed in Southern France, leading to the liberation of more countries and the expulsion of Hitler's army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Yugoslavia even threw out German troops on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

Germany was now being attacked from three sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Hitler planned his last major offensive, the Battle of the Bulge, in the Ardennes forest region, intending to drive out Allied forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Before invading Germany, Allied Forces carried out devastating aerial bombings on German cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

In February 1945, the Yalta Conference in Crimea announced that any country declaring war on Germany could join the Allied forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Consequently, Venezuela, Uruguay, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, and Paraguay declared war on Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The final four months of [[causes_of_world_war_ii | WWII]] were the most painful, with nearly 30,000 deaths daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. As Allied forces advanced, they discovered Hitler's concentration camps where hundreds of thousands of innocent Jews were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## The End of the War in Europe

Allied forces continued bombing German cities, despite later criticism of its necessity and the civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. By this point, it was clear that Hitler was about to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Finally, in May 1945, Berlin was surrounded by the Soviet Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Two days prior, on April 30, 1945, Hitler killed himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. On May 8, 1945, Germany formally surrendered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

German territories were subsequently divided into East and West Germany, and Poland was recreated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. The borders of many countries were redrawn, shaping the current map of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The new German government formed cordial relations with France, ending their long enmity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. This cooperation eventually led to the formation of the European Union, which has helped prevent another war like [[causes_of_world_war_ii | WWII]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. In October 1945, the United Nations was established to prevent future World Wars, along with frameworks for the World Bank, IMF, and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The permanent members of the United Nations were largely the Allied Forces of [[causes_of_world_war_ii | WWII]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

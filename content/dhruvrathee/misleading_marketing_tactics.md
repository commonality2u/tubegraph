Companies are increasingly adopting deceptive methods to exploit and deceive consumers on a large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>. These [[marketing_strategies_and_consumer_protection_laws | marketing strategies]] are systematically used to maximize profits, often at the consumer's expense.

## Types of Misleading Tactics

### 1. Discriminatory Pricing

This tactic involves charging different prices for the same product or service based on factors like the user's device or battery level.

*   **Device-Based Pricing**:
    *   In January 2025, Zepto's Android app sold 1 kg onions for ₹43, while on an iPhone, the same quantity was ₹57 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Similarly, 500 grams of grapes were ₹146 on iPhone and ₹65 on Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
    *   Zepto was also accused of selling green bell peppers for ₹21 on Android phones and ₹107 on iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
    *   In December 2024, a Flipkart user observed a suitcase priced at ₹4,119 on the Android app but ₹4,799 on the iOS app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    *   Subscription services also vary: YouTube Premium costs ₹195 on iPhone versus ₹149 on Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Twitter's Premium Plus subscription is ₹2,299/month on iPhone and ₹2,150 on Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   **Battery-Level Pricing**:
    *   Cab booking apps like Uber have been accused of increasing prices when a user's phone battery is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
    *   A 2023 study by a Belgian newspaper found that Uber charged more for a taxi requested from a phone with 12% battery compared to one with 84% battery from the same location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
    *   While Uber denies this, their Head of Economic Research, Keith Chen, stated in a 2016 NPR interview that people are willing to pay more if their phone battery is running out, and the app can check battery levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
    *   An experiment by Rishabh Singh, founder of Engineer Hub, in January 2025, also confirmed that Uber charged more for cabs on devices with low battery levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### 2. Planned Obsolescence

This tactic involves companies deliberately designing products to have a limited lifespan, forcing consumers to buy replacements sooner than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Despite having the technology to create more durable goods, they opt for designs that break down or become obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

*   **Smartphones**: Batteries are often sealed to prevent easy replacement, compelling users to purchase new phones when battery performance declines after 3-4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   **Intentional Slowdown**: Customers have long claimed that Apple slows down iPhones to encourage new purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
    *   In 2018, Italy's Competition Authority fined Apple (€10 million) and Samsung (€5 million) after finding that software updates intentionally worsened smartphone performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
    *   In 2020, Apple was fined €25 million in France for slowing down older phones without informing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
    *   Apple admitted that older iPhones slow down, excusing it as a measure to prevent unexpected shutdowns due to deteriorating battery performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
    *   In America, Apple was ordered to pay $500 million to customers for these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: Planned obsolescence dates back 100 years, when light bulb manufacturers reduced bulb lifespans to boost sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Modern Appliances**: Fridges, washing machines, and microwave ovens now often have lifespans of only 5-7 years, and sometimes as little as 3-4 years, due to deliberate use of cheap materials and designs that break easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Government Intervention**:
    *   The European Union introduced "Right to Repair Rules" in 2021, requiring companies to carry replacement parts for at least 10 years and ensure products are easily repairable with commonly available, universal parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
    *   This law led Apple to adopt USB-C chargers for iPhones from iPhone 15 onwards, replacing their proprietary lightning connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

### 3. Shrinkflation

Shrinkflation is the practice where companies maintain or increase product prices while subtly reducing the product's size, quantity, or quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

*   **Examples**:
    *   A ₹10 packet of Parle-G biscuits reduced from 140g in 2021 to 110g in 2022, and originally contained 250g many years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
    *   Maggi packets reduced from 80g to 55g <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
    *   Thums Up and Coca-Cola ₹20 bottles reduced from 250ml to 200ml <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
    *   The size of McDonald's Big Mac has visibly reduced between 2004 and 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
    *   Lays packets contain mostly air with a handful of chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
    *   Post-COVID, a ₹10 Vim dish soap reduced from 155g to 135g within three months in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
    *   A ₹10 Haldiram's Aloo Bhujia reduced from 55g to 42g <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
    *   A ₹1 Hajmola packet reduced from 6 tablets to 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
    *   In 2022, Dominos reduced chicken wings from 10 to 8 for their $7.99 offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
    *   Walmart's toilet paper rolls reduced from 168 sheets to 120 sheets (28% reduction) before 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. Even toilet paper is getting smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
*   **Innovative Reductions**:
    *   In 2013, Cadbury reduced Dairy Milk bar size by 10% by shrinking individual squares and reducing overall thickness, not the number of squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
    *   In 2016, Toblerone reduced its chocolate weight from 400g to 360g by increasing the space between each chocolate piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

### 4. Misusing Buzzwords

Companies exploit trending terms in their marketing to deceive customers, often engaging in [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | propaganda techniques in media]].

*   **"AI Washing"**: The term "AI" is liberally applied to products like phones and washing machines, implying advanced machine learning or deep learning capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. However, these products often run on basic pre-programmed settings labelled as AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. For instance, "AI" washing machines might claim to recognize fabric but only use basic temperature settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   **False Endorsements**: Companies make grand claims like being the "#1 choice of doctors" for RO brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>, or "#1 choice of dentists" for toothpaste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.
    *   The Medical Council of India's Rules of Ethics state that no doctor can endorse commercial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
    *   The ASCI (Advertising Standards Council of India) has deemed such claims misleading, often leading to withdrawal of ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.
    *   Some ads ambiguously mention "WHO," implying the World Health Organisation, when they refer to a non-credible "Women's Health Organisation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

### 5. Razor & Blade Model

In this model, the main product is sold cheaply or at a loss to create customer dependency, while the primary profit comes from expensive, frequently purchased side products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

*   **Printers and Ink**: Printers are sold cheaply, but expensive ink cartridges are the main profit driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.
    *   Companies design printers to only be compatible with their own ink cartridges, sometimes by putting microchips in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
    *   Regular firmware updates prevent the use of third-party ink, or stop the printer from working, or void the warranty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. In 2018, 9 printer companies issued around 900 such updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.
    *   Printer ink is extremely expensive, costing around $12,000 per gallon (3.7 liters) compared to $20-$40 per liter to make, making it cheaper than human blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.
    *   Shrinkflation also applies to ink cartridges; "Standard" cartridges are now sold as "Extra Large" for less ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
    *   HP faced lawsuits and paid compensation in Australia ($100,000 to 2,000 customers) and Europe ($1.35 million) for these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.
    *   Epson was sued in the US in 2019 for printers stopping when third-party ink was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.
*   **Water Purifiers**: After purchasing a water purifier, customers must regularly service it and change filters, which are often expensive and not covered by Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
    *   Expensive parts like membranes and filters (costing ₹4,000-₹6,000) are typically excluded from a ₹2,500 AMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
    *   Moving a purifier often requires a company engineer visit for ₹600, otherwise the AMC is cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.
    *   Some RO companies cancel AMC coverage if the RO runs for more than 8 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.
    *   Urban Company's Native RO is highlighted as an ethical example, offering filters that last 2 years and an unconditional warranty, reducing the need for AMCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

### 6. Drip Pricing

Customers are initially shown a low product price, but various taxes and charges are added during the purchase process, increasing the final cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. Companies believe that once a customer is lured by a low price, they will complete the purchase despite additional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.

*   **Examples**: Shoes advertised at ₹4,700 may become ₹5,130 after handling, donation, and platform charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>.
*   Food delivery apps and movie ticket platforms like BookMyShow also use this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.
*   The central government has warned against this, but companies persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>.

### 7. Bait and Switch

Companies lure customers with attractive, low-priced offers (the "bait") but then claim the item is unavailable and push a different, often more expensive or higher-profit item (the "switch") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

*   **Retail**: A customer seeking a specific 50-inch plasma TV is told it's sold out, then convinced to buy a smaller, higher-profit 30-inch model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>.
*   **Hotels**: Hotels advertise low-priced rooms but add mandatory fees and other charges upon checkout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

## Impact on Consumers and Environment

These tactics not only exploit consumers financially but also have significant environmental consequences.

*   **Increased Consumption**: Products designed to break quickly and constant new product launches (even with minimal innovation) drive up consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. For example, brands like Oppo, Vivo, Realme, OnePlus, and IQOO are all owned by the same company, BBK Electronics, releasing numerous similar phones, giving the illusion of choice while driving sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.
*   **Resource Depletion**: Higher consumption necessitates more mining of elements like gold, cobalt, and lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.
*   **Carbon Emissions**: The entire lifecycle of products, from mining to production and use, results in carbon emissions. Smartphones alone caused 580 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>.
*   **E-waste**: The short lifespan of electronics contributes significantly to e-waste, with smartphones accounting for 10% of the world's e-waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>.

## Solutions and Consumer Action

To counter these [[marketing_strategies_and_consumer_protection_laws | misleading marketing tactics]], collective action from both governments and consumers is crucial.

*   **Government Regulation**: Governments need to implement stricter regulations and take action against companies that engage in such deceptive practices, mirroring efforts in developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.
*   **Consumer Awareness and Advocacy**: Consumers must become more vigilant and speak out against such injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.
    *   Publicly call out companies on social media platforms like Twitter, using their handles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:00">[21:33:00]</a>.
    *   Email companies directly.
    *   Create short videos or Instagram Reels to raise awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>.
    *   Increased public pressure can force companies to take corrective actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example of Consumer Power
> An example of collective consumer pressure leading to change is a case where "fruit juice" companies sued after their misleading practices were exposed in a video. The video was initially removed, but due to public pressure and a legal fight, it was reinstated, and the company even changed its product content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>.

By uniting and raising voices, consumers can push for greater transparency and ethical business practices, fostering a market where competition benefits customers through innovation, rather than exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>.

During [[causes_of_world_war_i | World War I]], the reality of public sentiment was complex, often differing from the enthusiasm portrayed by leaders and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Unlike modern conflicts where widespread public consensus might be sought, the monarchical governments of the time largely disregarded the opinions of their populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Lack of Public Desire for War

The common people did not generally desire [[causes_of_world_war_i | World War I]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Despite this, commoners were compelled into the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. A primary reason for enlistment was economic necessity: the job of a soldier was often taken by the poor due to lack of employment and the need to earn money for their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Soldiers risked their lives for the ambitions of their rulers, rather than out of a desire to invade or capture other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

## Propaganda and Glorification of War

To motivate participation, governments and media engaged in extensive propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Newspapers and other media outlets cultivated an image that joining the army was a noble and selfless act for one's country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Soldiers were depicted as disciplined gentlemen and heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The media actively glorified war itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

An example of this glorification is the reporting of the Crimean War, where a failed military action resulting in 200 British soldier deaths was exaggerated by *The Times* of London to portray it as a heroic act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This narrative was further reinforced by official poets like Alfred Tennyson, whose poem "The Charge of The Light Brigade" was one of the first to portray soldiers as heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Similarly, Rupert Brooke's poems, such as "The Soldier" and "The Dead," depicted war and death as glorious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Brooke's poems were even used by Winston Churchill to recruit more soldiers after Brooke's death in [[causes_of_world_war_i | World War I]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This type of war-mongering propaganda aimed to convince people that fighting for their "country" (which, in monarchical systems, referred to the emperor's rule) was a great endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## Anti-War Sentiment and Movements

Despite widespread propaganda, not everyone was swayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Many individuals and groups across various countries were staunchly against the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>:

*   **Political Parties** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>
    *   America's Socialist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>
    *   Italian Socialist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>
    *   British Labour Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>
    *   Russia's Bolsheviks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>
    *   Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>
*   **Ideological Groups** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>
    *   Anarchists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>
    *   Syndicalists, who advocated for Internationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>
*   **Individuals based on Religion and Humanity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>
    *   [[political_and_moral_debates_about_the_use_of_nuclear_weapons | Henry Ford]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>
    *   Valentine Bulgakov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>
*   **Poets and Intellectuals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>
    *   Rudyard Kipling, author of *The Jungle Book*, wrote "The Last of The Light Brigade" as a counter-poem to highlight the inhumane conditions soldiers faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
    *   Wilfred Owen's poems exposed the harsh realities of war, including "poisonous fumes, wounded limbs, [and] coughing blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
    *   Thomas Hardy's 1909 poem, "The Man He Killed," depicted a soldier who killed another simply because both, driven by unemployment, had enlisted and been forced to fight each other, despite having no personal enmity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

### Acts of Dissent

Not every soldier was swayed by pro-war propaganda, leading to several cases of mutiny and dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>:

*   **French Mutinies**
    An entire battalion in France once laid down their arms, refusing to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Russian Revolts**
    In Russia, soldiers actively waged war against their own rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **The Christmas Truce (1914)**
    Perhaps the most notable example was the Christmas Truce of 1914, where British and German soldiers on the battlefield spontaneously ceased hostilities to celebrate Christmas together. They exchanged food and sang songs, demonstrating that common soldiers often had no personal reason to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Commanders eventually ordered them to stop and resume fighting, imposing severe punishments for refusal, including execution by their own troops for desertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

Diet soft drinks, such as Diet Pepsi (launched in 1964) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a> and Diet Coke (launched in 1982) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, contain zero calories and zero added sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Instead of sugar, these beverages utilize [[ingredients_in_popular_soft_drinks | artificial sweeteners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Types of Artificial Sweeteners

*   Aspartame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>
*   Saccharin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>

## Controversial History and Health Concerns

[[ingredients_in_popular_soft_drinks | Artificial sweeteners]] have a controversial history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, with many studies linking them to various [[health_risks_of_soft_drinks | health risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Links to Cancer
Multiple studies have suggested a link between [[ingredients_in_popular_soft_drinks | artificial sweeteners]] and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This has led to bans in some places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. However, other organizations have published studies asserting no such links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

A study conducted in France, published on March 24, 2022, monitored 100,000 adults over 7-8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This research indicated that aspartame increases the risk of cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The official website of the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) also states a link between aspartame and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

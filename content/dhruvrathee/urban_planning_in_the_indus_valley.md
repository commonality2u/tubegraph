The Indus Valley Civilization, a Bronze Age civilization primarily located in modern-day Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Northwest India, demonstrates remarkable advancements in urban planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Though a significant amount is known about this civilization in 2022, its unique urban design sets it apart from many of its contemporaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## Early Urbanization
While early farming settlements in areas like present-day Haryana date back to 7,000 BC, featuring agricultural tools and pottery, the true beginning of urbanization in the Indus Valley is believed to have occurred after 5,500 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. This period saw the establishment of public buildings and trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. By 2,600 BC, the civilization was highly advanced, constructing multi-storied brick houses in its cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Sophisticated City Layouts
All unearthed cities of the Indus Valley Civilization share a remarkably similar pattern, indicating a deliberate and standardized approach to urban planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

### Dual Segmentation
Each city was typically divided into two main segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>:
1.  **The Lower Mount**: This area was surrounded by its own boundary wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
2.  **The Citadel (Upper Mount)**: Built on higher ground, usually to the west of the city, this fort also had its own boundary walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. The citadel housed important public spaces such as marketplaces and workshops, serving as a gathering point for residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

### Defensive Structures and Purpose
The city walls were primarily built to keep out wild animals and protect the cities from floods, ensuring safety even if river levels rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. Significantly, unlike many other ancient civilizations, there is no evidence suggesting these walls were primarily for defense against human invasion, as humans were not considered a major threat at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.

### Infrastructure and Amenities
The cities showcased advanced infrastructure and public services:
*   **Standardized Bricks**: Bricks used for construction had standardized measurements, ensuring uniformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Household Facilities**: Every house included a toilet and a bathing area, highlighting a focus on hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Drainage Systems**: Houses featured drainage systems to remove water and waste, which connected to proper gutters on the roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Public Utilities**: Cities were equipped with public wells for drinking water and designated dustbins for waste disposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Footpaths also featured trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Modern Cities**: In terms of urban planning, these ancient cities were "perhaps better than our Indian cities today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Notable Structures: The Great Bath of Mohenjo-Daro
Mohenjo-Daro, likely the capital city of the Indus Valley Civilization, is home to the iconic Great Bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. This large, multi-storied swimming pool measured 900 ftÂ² in length and 2.4 meters in depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. Constructed with burnt bricks and waterproofed with natural tar, it featured a drainage hole and a well, ensuring a constant supply of fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

## Unique Societal Structure
A significant distinguishing feature of the Indus Valley Civilization, especially when [[Comparisons with Other Ancient Civilizations | compared to Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations]], is the lack of discovered temples, mosques, or explicit religious sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Similarly, no palaces, royal tombs, or evidence of a monarch, priests, religious leaders, army, or warfare have been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. This suggests a potentially unique, advanced society that lived peacefully and without overt social hierarchy, a topic of ongoing debate among historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.

## Decline
Between 1900 BC and 1300 BC, the civilization experienced a rapid decline, marked by the cessation of city planning, lack of maintenance for sewers and drainage systems, the filling of the Great Bath with waste, and the end of trade links with Mesopotamia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. By 1800 BC, most cities were depopulated, and the standardized writing system and building practices fell into disuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. The exact reasons for this decline remain a mystery, though [[Theories on the Decline of the Indus Valley Civilization | several theories]] exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

Bollywood, while experiencing a surge in box office numbers in 2023, faces a bitter truth: a loss of soul, partly due to increased competition from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>.

## Rise of OTT and Changing Viewer Habits
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted Bollywood, as lockdowns and restrictions prevented people from visiting cinema halls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:03">[02:34:03]</a>. This period saw an unprecedented growth in OTT (Over-The-Top) platforms, with people developing a habit of watching films at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:12">[02:36:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:03">[02:41:03]</a>.

OTT platforms offered viewers numerous films at a fraction of the cost compared to cinema tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:15">[02:45:15]</a>. The introduction of free, ad-supported OTT platforms, such as Amazon Mini TV (now Amazon MX Player), further changed the landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:23">[02:50:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a>. These platforms allow viewers to access content for free, similar to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:17">[03:09:17]</a>.

## Diverse Content Offerings
OTT platforms provide a vast library of content, including:
*   **Classics:** Older films like 1972's *Aankh Micholi* are available for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:24">[03:15:24]</a>.
*   **Regional Languages:** Content in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bhojpuri, and Punjabi is accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:50">[03:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>.
*   **World Cinema:** International films such as *Mulan*, *Chinese Zodiac*, and *Dark Space* are available, often dubbed in Hindi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:07">[03:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>. This includes popular formats like kDramas and Mandarin dramas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:33">[14:30:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:10">[14:35:10]</a>.

This proliferation of content on OTT platforms has created significant challenges for Bollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:08">[03:40:08]</a>.

## Competition from All Sides
Bollywood now faces competition from both international films and regional Indian films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:08">[03:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The traditional method of remaking Tamil and Telugu films, once a reliable strategy, no longer guarantees success because audiences can easily watch the original versions on OTT platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This "ninja technique" has dried up as people can watch originals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The rise of Hollywood's corporatisation, similar to Bollywood's, also poses a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:23">[09:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:03">[09:16:03]</a>. When these two corporate models clash, Hollywood often prevails due to its larger budgets, superior VFX, and bigger sets, making it difficult for Bollywood to compete on those terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:12">[09:27:12]</a>.

## Impact on Film Quality and Audience Choice
With options like *Avengers* films, *Game of Thrones*, *Lord of the Rings*, or *Avatar* available, audiences question why they should choose a Bollywood film like *Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan*, which might feature average acting and an overdone storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:04">[12:43:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:19">[12:48:19]</a>.

Film exhibitor Vishek Chauhan describes Bollywood films as lacking imagination and having an "age-old Bollywood drama" that has dried up, often resembling older Hollywood films without a distinct Indian element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:08">[13:58:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:47">[14:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:04">[14:10:04]</a>. He emphasizes that a film should be a total package, including music, content, and emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:48">[14:14:48]</a>.

## Challenges for Small-Budget Films
The dominance of big-budget, superstar-led films, often made using a formulaic approach, leaves little possibility for smaller, content-driven films to succeed through word-of-mouth as they once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. Examples like *Bheja Fry* (₹5.4 million budget, ₹125 million earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>, *Kahaani* (₹80 million budget, ₹1.04 billion earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>, and *Badhaai Ho* (₹290 million budget, ₹2.19 billion earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a> demonstrate past successes that are now rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>.

Today, if such films do not get a theatrical release, they are labeled as "OTT films" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>. However, many OTT platforms now prefer to release a film only after its successful run at the box office, or they determine their acquisition price based on box office performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>. This creates a Catch-22, as smaller films often don't get a fair chance to compete in theaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.

Siddharth Roy Kapur, founder of Roy Kapur Films, notes that small-budget films "oil the wheels of the industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>. If only a few big blockbuster films are made annually, the industry will not be sustainable in the future and will lack the necessary workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.

## The Way Forward
For Bollywood to survive, its entire ecosystem needs to become more inclusive, providing space and support for low-budget films from production to release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>. A lower budget would allow more films to be made, create more jobs, lead to cheaper tickets, and expand the audience base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. Production houses of superstars could emulate Aamir Khan's production of *Laapataa Ladies*, a content-driven, small-budget film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>. This approach is seen as the only way to save the Hindi film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.

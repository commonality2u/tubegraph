Vibhishan, a character from the Valmiki's Ramayan, is often portrayed as a figure of intense scrutiny and even hate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. While his brother Ravan receives sympathy from some, Vibhishan is largely seen as a "traitor" or an "anti-national" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. The proverb, "The traitor in the family, cause Lanka's downfall," is often associated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This negative perception is echoed in popular culture, such as Gulzar Channiwala's song "Vibhishan," which has over 6.1 million views and features the line, "friends like Vibhishan set fire to my Lanka" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Vibhishan's Stance and Actions

In the narrative, Vibhishan chose to align with Lord Ram against his brother Ravan due to Ravan's evil deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Even Ravan's brother Kumbhkaran acknowledged Ravan's wrongdoings, stating that those who do evil are sure to face downfall and that Ravan's doom was imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. Despite knowing this, Kumbhkaran participated in the war, making him a "partner in crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. Vibhishan, however, opted to switch sides, choosing what he perceived as the path of right over loyalty to his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

## Choosing Right Over Loyalty

Vibhishan's decision to change alliances, choosing the path of right, is not a unique case and is often admired in other contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

### Parallels in Fiction and Real Life
*   **Film *Deewaar***: The honest policeman Ravi confronts his gangster brother Vijay, urging him to abandon a life of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. Ravi, who ultimately kills his brother, is seen as the hero, despite acting as a "traitor" to his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.
*   **Film *Vaastav***: The gangster Raghu is killed by his own mother, demonstrating a similar choice of right over familial loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.
*   **Nichole Schubert (2019)**: This real-life example illustrates the difficulty of such a choice. Nichole Schubert informed the police about her son's plans for a mass shooting after reading his diary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. She stated in a 2022 interview that saving even one life made the difficult decision of going against her son "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
*   **Edward Snowden**: The CIA whistleblower chose to expose wrongdoing within his country's organization, despite the repercussions, and is remembered as a hero for prioritizing truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

These examples highlight a critical question: when an organization or individual is involved in wrongdoing, should loyalty prevail, or should the path of truth and good be chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>?

## Debunking the "Pot of Elixir" Myth

One common accusation against Vibhishan is that he revealed Ravan's secret of a "pot of elixir" in his stomach, which Ram then targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. However, according to Valmiki's Ramayan, there is no mention of such a pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. This detail was added in later versions of the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. In Valmiki's Ramayan, Ravan's death is described as Ram shooting a special arrow that hit the evil-minded Ravan's heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Vibhishan's choice to be a nonconformist, prioritizing the distinction between good and evil over blind loyalty, was righteous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. As Rudyard Kipling wrote in his poem, "If you are able to save your head, while everyone else is losing theirs, You will be a man, my son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. Lanka's destruction was not caused by Vibhishan, but by the evil deeds of Ravan and Kumbhkaran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

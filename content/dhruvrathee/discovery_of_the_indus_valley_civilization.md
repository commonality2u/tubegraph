The existence of what is now known as the [[indus_valley_civilization | Indus Valley Civilization]] remained unknown for millennia, buried beneath layers of earth and time. Its rediscovery began in the early 19th century and was formally identified in the 20th century.

## Early European Encounters

The first recorded encounter with the ruins of the [[indus_valley_civilization | Indus Valley Civilization]] was by James Lewis, a soldier of the British East India Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Fed up with the company's antics, Lewis deserted the army in 1827, changed his name, and pursued his passion for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. After two years of traveling the Indian subcontinent, he arrived in the Punjab region in 1829 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

There, he stumbled upon the ruins of an ancient, unknown city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Unaware of its age or the civilization it belonged to, Lewis, due to his passion for history, began to meticulously document his findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He took notes and created drawings of the ruins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Lewis, however, did not realize that he had discovered the ancient city of Harappa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Formal Excavations and Identification

A century later, in the 1920s, more information about this ancient civilization began to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. John Marshall, then director of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), surveyed the [[urban_planning_in_the_indus_valley | ruins of Harappa]] with the assistance of Indian archaeologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These ruins were found to be over 5,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

During this period, another historical site was discovered on the banks of the Indus River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This place, containing numerous human skeletal remains, was named Mohenjo-Daro, meaning "The Mound of the Dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Further excavations revealed many more such historical sites, confirming the existence of a vast, previously unknown civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Because these ruins were predominantly found along the banks of the Indus River, the civilization was formally named the [[indus_valley_civilization | Indus Valley Civilisation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Extent and Chronology

As of 2022, extensive knowledge about the [[indus_valley_civilization | Indus Valley Civilization]] has been accumulated, becoming part of school curricula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. It is recognized as a Bronze Age Civilization, spanning present-day Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Northwest India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Over 1,400 sites have been discovered, with 900 located in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

It existed concurrently with only a few other ancient civilizations, primarily the [[comparisons_with_other_ancient_civilizations | Egyptian]], Mesopotamian, and Chinese Civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While Mesopotamia was commonly believed to be the oldest human civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, a 2016 study by IIT Kharagpur and ASI, using archaeological dating techniques, suggested that the [[indus_valley_civilization | Indus Valley Civilisation]] might be 8,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Evidence indicates farming settlements dating back to 7,000 BC were discovered in present-day Haryana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The period from 7,000 BC to 5,500 BC is known as the Pre-Harappan Phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Urbanization is believed to have begun after 5,500 BC, with the establishment of public buildings and trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. By 2,600 BC, the civilization was highly advanced, featuring multistoried brick houses with standardized measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Enduring Mysteries

Despite extensive discoveries, two significant mysteries remain concerning the [[indus_valley_civilization | Indus Valley Civilization]]:
*   The [[mysteries_of_the_harappan_language | Harappan language]] or Indus Script, which has not yet been deciphered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   The exact cause of the civilization's rapid decline and end between 1900 BC and 1300 BC, a subject of various [[theories_on_the_decline_of_the_indus_valley_civilization | theories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The process of discovery continues to shed light on this unique and advanced ancient civilization, challenging previous assumptions about human history and development.

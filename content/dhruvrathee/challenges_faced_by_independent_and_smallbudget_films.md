Despite a significant box office resurgence in 2023 with films like *Jawan*, *Pathan*, and *Dunki* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, many believe Bollywood has "lost its soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a> and is "slowly killing itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This concern stems from deep-seated issues that disproportionately affect independent and small-budget films, making it increasingly difficult for them to thrive.

## Historical Context: The Soul of Bollywood

Historically, Bollywood was known for films that touched hearts, provoked thought, and were memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Classics like *Mughal-e-Azam*, *Sholay*, *Mother India*, and *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge* were unique gems with proper stories, emotions, and substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Even smaller films like *Bheja Fry*, made on a budget of ₹5.4 million, became a hit through word-of-mouth, earning ₹125 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Films like *Kahaani* (₹80 million budget, ₹1.04 billion earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a> and *Badhaai Ho* (₹290 million budget, ₹2.19 billion earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> showcased the potential for high returns on unique concepts and strong content. These films "breathed a soul into Bollywood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a> by experimenting with diverse genres, including horror, animation, and superhero themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Current Challenges

### [[competition_from_ott_platforms_and_international_films | Competition from OTT Platforms and International Films]]

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted Bollywood, as lockdowns led people to consume content at home, boosting OTT platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The rise of free, ad-supported OTT platforms like Amazon MX Player allows viewers to watch numerous films, including regional and world cinema dubbed in Hindi, at no cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This fierce [[competition_from_ott_platforms_and_international_films | competition from OTT platforms and international films]] makes it harder for traditional cinema, especially smaller films, to attract audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### [[impact_of_corporatisation_on_bollywood_cinema | Impact of Corporatisation on Bollywood Cinema]]

The increasing [[impact_of_corporatisation_on_bollywood_cinema | corporatisation on Bollywood cinema]] has led producers to prioritize profit over creativity, resulting in a formulaic approach to filmmaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>:
*   **Reliance on proven formulas**: Avoiding anything new and sticking to what has worked before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   **Action films and remakes**: Focusing on power-packed action, sequels, remakes of super hit films, and old songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   **Superstar casting**: Casting superstars in lead roles and actors with "good face value" in side roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
*   **Copying Hollywood**: Replicating stories, scenes, and scripts from Hollywood films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Appeasing mindsets**: Avoiding thought-provoking themes or societal critiques to appease public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **Fast-paced narratives**: Catering to decreased attention spans with rapid pacing and no long, profound scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Larger-than-life spectacle**: Emphasizing big stars, sets, locations, budgets, and VFX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive marketing**: Spending heavily on marketing to ensure widespread discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

This formula, while generating blockbusters like *Jawan* and *Pathan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, often results in "mediocre" films that are not memorable or impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Filmmaker Shekhar Kapur noted that corporations are controlling creativity, and director Anurag Basu confirmed that studios dictate what films are made, often rejecting original ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. Screenwriter Chirag Garg lamented that the writing department has become mechanical, lacking passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

### [[financial_inequality_and_inflated_actor_fees in Bollywood | Financial Inequality and Inflated Actor Fees]]

Despite record earnings for the Indian box office in 2023 (₹122.26 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>, 40% of this revenue was generated by only the top 1% of films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. This highlights a dangerous level of [[financial_inequality_and_inflated_actor_fees in Bollywood | financial inequality and inflated actor fees in Bollywood]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Small and medium-budget films struggle to be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

A significant portion of a film's budget is consumed by superstar fees. For instance, 60% of the ₹1 billion budget for Akshay Kumar's *Khel Khel Mein* went directly to his fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. This leaves minimal funds for story, direction, screenplay, and dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. When a single actor commands ₹1.5 billion (as Prabhas did for *Adipurush*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>, there's little left for CGI and VFX, making it difficult to compete with Hollywood's grand productions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

### [[loss_of_originality_and_creativity_in_Bollywood | Loss of Originality and Creativity in Bollywood]]

The current trend shows a significant [[loss_of_originality_and_creativity_in_Bollywood | loss of originality and creativity in Bollywood]]. The industry largely produces films in only three genres: melodramatic action, melodramatic comedy, or melodramatic patriotic films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>. This decline in diversity means Bollywood is "losing its soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. Remakes of Tamil and Telugu films, once a reliable technique, no longer work because audiences can easily access the originals via OTT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Javed Akhtar pointed out that while actors are "great," there are no "great characters" anymore, reflecting a shift from deep, wounded anger to superficial rage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. The rapid corporatisation has replaced experienced creatives like Akhtar with young corporate MBAs in decision-making roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>, further stifling genuine storytelling.

### Difficulties in Theatrical Release and Promotion

Independent and small-budget films face immense hurdles in securing theatrical releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. They often don't get prime time slots or even a full week in cinemas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. This lack of exposure prevents word-of-mouth publicity, crucial for their success, unlike past classics like *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge* that had slow starts but gained traction over weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. Filmmaker Dibakar Banerjee stated that independent cinema is being "systematically sidelined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>, with studios promoting films based on box office earnings rather than artistic merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. Many award-winning films are not even shown in Indian cinemas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.

Furthermore, movie tickets have become prohibitively expensive, especially in cities like Delhi, where there are no affordable cinema halls for the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>. Going to the cinema has transformed from a weekly middle-class activity to a rare "picnic once in a few months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. This makes audiences less likely to risk money on lesser-known, smaller films.

## The Way Forward

Trade analyst Komal Nahta laments that "no one is thinking about the industry at large" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>, with actors focused on their bank balances and producers solely on viewership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Siddharth Roy Kapur, founder of Roy Kapur Films, emphasizes that small-budget films "oil the wheels of the industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>, and relying solely on a few blockbusters is unsustainable for the future workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.

The solution, though difficult, lies in making Bollywood's entire ecosystem more inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>. This means:
*   **Supporting low-budget films**: Giving them space from production to release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>.
*   **Increased production**: Lower budgets allow more films to be made, creating more jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.
*   **Affordable tickets**: Cheaper tickets would expand the audience base, making cinema accessible to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.
*   **Superstar-backed content-driven films**: Production houses of big stars, like Aamir Khan's backing of *Laapataa Ladies* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>, can support content-driven, small-budget films.

Ultimately, for the Hindi film industry to be saved, Bollywood needs to return to creating unique, meaningful, and content-driven films with good music, songs, and acting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>.

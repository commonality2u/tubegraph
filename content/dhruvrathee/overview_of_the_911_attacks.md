The 11th of September 2001 was a horrifying day that profoundly impacted America and, arguably, changed the world forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Even two decades later, the effects of this day are still visible in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Attacks Unfold

On the morning of September 11, 2001, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks targeted significant American landmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### American Airlines Flight 11 (North Tower)

American Airlines Flight 11, carrying 92 people (11 crew, 81 passengers), departed from Boston's international airport en route to Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Approximately 15 minutes after takeoff, it was discovered that 5 of the passengers were hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. These hijackers, including Mohamed Atta, an Egyptian pilot, overpowered the crew and passengers to take control of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Atta flew the plane directly into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City at 8:46 am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The World Trade Center, once the world's tallest building, was a monumental and historic structure, a source of pride for New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### United Airlines Flight 175 (South Tower)

Just 17 minutes after the first crash, it was confirmed that United Airlines Flight 175 had also been hijacked by 5 individuals who similarly overpowered the pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This plane was then crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

At the time of the first crash, US President George Bush was touring a school in Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. He initially believed it to be a pilot's heart attack or a horrible accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. After the second crash, his Chief of Staff, Andrew Gadd, informed him that "America is under attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Despite this grave news, President Bush remained in the classroom for another 7 minutes, continuing a reading exercise with children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This delay later drew significant criticism regarding his immediate response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### American Airlines Flight 77 (Pentagon)

Minutes after the second plane crash, news emerged of two more hijacked flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. American Airlines Flight 77, which had departed from Washington's international airport for Los Angeles, was carrying 5 hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This flight was rerouted towards Washington D.C., the capital of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The hijackers crashed Flight 77 into The Pentagon, the headquarters of the US Department of Defense, located on the outskirts of Washington D.C., at 9:37 am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. A significant portion of The Pentagon was destroyed in this impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Following this third crash, the entire airspace of the United States was shut down, with all airborne planes ordered to land at their nearest airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### United Airlines Flight 93 (Pennsylvania)

The fourth hijacked plane was United Airlines Flight 93, traveling from New Jersey to California, with 4 hijackers aboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This flight was also rerouted towards Washington D.C., and it was suspected its target was either the White House (the US President's residence) or the US Capitol (the legislative seat of the US Federal Government, comparable to the Indian Parliament) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

However, passengers on Flight 93 learned about the other attacks from phone calls with family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Realizing their fate, they bravely fought back against the hijackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Though the exact details of the struggle in the cockpit remain unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, the plane ultimately crash-landed in an empty field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The passengers' courage saved many lives by preventing the plane from hitting its intended target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Collapses of the World Trade Center Towers

Due to the intense fires and structural damage from the plane impacts, the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed at 9:59 am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. At 10:28 am, the North Tower also collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Aftermath and Responsibility

By noon of September 11, over 3,000 people had died across the incidents, and more than 6,000 were injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The terrorist group Al-Qaeda was identified as responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Initially, Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al-Qaeda, denied responsibility for the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, in 2004, he publicly acknowledged and took responsibility for the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Osama justified the attacks as a response to perceived US interference in the Middle East, its support for Israel, actions against Muslims in Lebanon, support for Russia against Muslims in Chechnya, sanctions against Iraq, and the presence of US troops in Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. His main conclusion was that these actions were taken because Muslims were being abused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

The 9/11 Commission Report identified Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani terrorist also involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, as the "Principal Architect" of the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. He, along with four other accused individuals, was incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay and remains on trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Osama bin Laden himself was eventually killed in May 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## [[Longterm Effects of the 911 Attacks on Global Politics | Long-term Impacts of 9/11]]

The 9/11 attacks had a profound and lasting impact on the lives of ordinary people worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### [[Changes in Legislation Post 911 | Changes in Legislation]]

Six weeks after the attacks, the US Congress swiftly passed the [[changes_in_legislation_post_911 | PATRIOT Act]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Many politicians passed this bill without reading it or proper discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This Act granted the US government immense power, allowing it to spy on its citizens, secretly access personal records and documents, and reduced the power of the Judiciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Critics argued it was used to silence dissenters by leveraging the threat of terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Edward Snowden's expos√© in 2013 revealed how the NSA collected daily phone records of customers without warrants or evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Airport Security Reforms

Airport security norms drastically changed after 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Before 2001, security checks were minimal, often just ID checks and basic metal detectors, with passengers needing to arrive only 15-30 minutes before flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Post-9/11, full-body scans, mandatory personal ID and passport checks, stringent bag screenings (requiring laptops and liquids to be removed), and restrictions on liquid quantities became standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Explosive detection systems were deployed nationwide after December 2002 and later globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. By early 2003, pilots were armed, and cockpit doors were reinforced against intrusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### US Military Interventions

Despite Osama bin Laden's stated reasons for the attacks, US interference in the Middle East only increased after 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. The US invaded Afghanistan to target terrorist groups, remaining there for 20 years, resulting in trillions of dollars in taxpayer money spent and numerous American soldiers and civilians killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. The US also invaded Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

### [[Rise in Xenophobia and Hate Crimes after the Attacks | Rise in Xenophobia and Hate Crimes]]

Contrary to Osama bin Laden's justification of avenging abuse against Muslims, the attacks led to an increase in attacks against Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. A new wave of [[rise_in_xenophobia_and_hate_crimes_after_the_attacks | xenophobia and hate crimes]] emerged against Muslims and South Asians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. In 2001, 481 hate crimes against Muslims were recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. Sikhs were also targeted due to misidentification with Osama bin Laden's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Balbir Singh Sodhi, who had donated to 9/11 victims, was killed in Arizona on September 15, 2001, by Frank Roque, the first victim of such hate violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Some Sikhs even shaved their beards and stopped wearing turbans for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

### Human Rights Concerns

The fear in America post-9/11 led to mass arrests without evidence, torture, and widespread human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Many Americans supported these actions, believing surveillance and the mistreatment of innocent people were justified in the "War on Terror," which critics often equated with torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

The events of 9/11 highlight that extremism breeds extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. The cycle of revenge, where actions by groups like Al-Qaeda lead to retaliatory responses by nations like the US, which then fuels further anger and terrorism, creates an "endless downward spiral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The killing of one terrorist often creates another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, as seen with the rise of organizations like ISIS after Osama bin Laden's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Furthermore, it is crucial for citizens to prevent governments from using acts of terrorism as excuses for exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The US government exploited its citizens through surveillance and the PATRIOT Act after 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. It is important not to be so blinded by fear that one loses sight of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

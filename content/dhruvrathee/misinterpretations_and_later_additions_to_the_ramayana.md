The story of the Ramayana, featuring [[qualities_and_principles_of_lord_ram | Lord Ram]], his wife Sita, and younger brother Lakshman, going into exile, Sita's kidnapping by the demon lord [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]], and the subsequent war where good triumphs over evil, often appears to be a simple narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, this story is not as simple as it seems, especially with modern interpretations challenging the "Hero Ram versus Villain [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Challenging the "Hero Ram vs. Villain Ravan" Narrative

There is a growing shift in perception, even across the political spectrum, with some developing a "soft corner" for [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. People are offering justifications for [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan's]] actions, suggesting he might not be as evil as commonly assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Conversely, [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan's]] third brother, Vibhishan, is often met with hate, labeled a "traitor" or "anti-national" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Proverbs like "The traitor in the family cause Lanka's downfall" and songs reflect this sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Worship of Ravan

Despite being traditionally portrayed as a villain, there are temples in India where [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] is worshipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Examples include:
*   A temple in Madhya Pradesh's Ravangaon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   The Dashanan [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] temple in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   A temple in Greater Noida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Temples in Rajasthan's Jodhpur and Andhra Pradesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

Worshippers at these temples chant "Jai Lankesh" and "Jai Ravan Baba" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Popular poems on YouTube also express admiration for [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]], with lines like "Let the world emulate Ram, I like being [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Debunking Justifications for Ravan's Actions

Arguments in favor of [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] often highlight his positive attributes, such as being a scholar of the Vedas and holy scriptures, a master of the Veena, and a devotee of Lord Shiva, a Brahmin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, possessing talent or high social standing does not negate criminal actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### The Problem with Identity-Based Judgement

Judging individuals based on their identity—tribe, faith, or deity worship—rather than their actions is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
> [!EXAMPLE]
> Adolf Hitler was a skilled painter, but this talent does not make him respectable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British-Pakistani terrorist involved in kidnappings and suspected 9/11 involvement, was highly intelligent, a chess champion, and fluent in five languages, but his intelligence does not make him "lesser evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Similarly, [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan's]] scholarship, devotion to Shiva, or Brahmin identity do not nullify his crimes, such as kidnapping Sita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Ravan's True Character and Crimes

According to Valmiki's [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayana]], [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] committed several atrocities:
*   **Kidnapping Sita**: This was a core crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Forcing Marich**: [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] coerced Marich to help him kidnap Sita, threatening death if he refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Marich chose to die by Ram's hand instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Killing Jatayu**: [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] mercilessly killed Jatayu when he tried to help Sita during the kidnapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

#### The Influence of [[the_addition_of_uttar_kand_to_the_original_ramayana | Uttarkand]]

The *Uttarkand*, often considered an epilogue to the [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayana]], is pointed out by scholars as a later addition and not part of the original [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. While it levies accusations against Ram (banishing Sita, killing Shambuk), it also significantly expands upon [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan's]] wrongdoings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Theft and Murder**: [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] attacked his half-brother Kuber, stealing Lanka and the Pushpak Viman (flying chariot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He then killed Kuber's peace messenger, and the demons consumed the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Cannibalism**: In *Uttarkand* 18:20, it is stated that [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] killed monks performing holy rites and drank their blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This portrays him as a "demonic murderer, robber, and cannibal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

#### Ravan as Administrator and Motive for Kidnapping Sita

Valmiki's [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayana]] provides no evidence that [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] was a good king or administrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. In fact, his sister Surpanakha criticized him (Aranyakaand, chapter 33), calling him addicted to vulgar pleasures, unguided, lustful, greedy, neglectful of his people, unable to protect his country, foolish, harsh, arrogant, intoxicated, short-tempered, evil-minded, and lacking good qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Valmiki notes that [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] acknowledged these wrongdoings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

The claim that [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] kidnapped Sita to avenge Surpanakha is also contradicted by Valmiki's [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. In Aranyakand's Chapters 17 and 18, Surpanakha approached Ram for marriage, insulted Sita by calling her "ugly, deformed, disfigured, fearful woman with a flat belly," and threatened to eat Sita and Lakshman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Lakshman then cut off her nose and ears after she attempted to kill Sita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. When Surpanakha later approached [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]], she did not ask for revenge; instead, she described Sita's beauty and lied that Lakshman cut off her nose because she tried to bring Sita to [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. She suggested [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] kill Ram to marry Sita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, indicating his motive was desire, not revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

#### Treatment of Sita

The assertion that [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] treated Sita with dignity is also false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Chapters 49-52 of Aranya Kaand and Sundarkand 22:8 and 22:9 detail how [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] threatened Sita, giving her a two-month deadline to agree to marry him, failing which she would be cooked for his breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This is not respectful behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## The Case of Vibhishan and Later Additions

Vibhishan, [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan's]] brother, who sided with Ram, is often vilified as a "traitor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This perspective prioritizes loyalty over the distinction between right and wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
> [!NOTE] Examples of admired disloyalty to wrongdoing:
> *   In the film *Deewaar*, the honest policeman kills his gangster brother, becoming a "hero" for choosing right over family loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
> *   In *Vastaav*, a mother kills her gangster son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
> *   Nichole Schubert reported her son's diary detailing a mass shooting plan to the police, choosing to save lives over loyalty to her child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
> *   CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden exposed his country's wrongdoings, seen by many as a hero for choosing truth over loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### Misinterpretations of Ravan's Death

A common accusation against Vibhishan is that he revealed [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan's]] secret of an "elixir pot" in his stomach, which Ram then targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. However, Valmiki's [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayana]] makes no mention of such a pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. This detail was added in later versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. According to Valmiki's [[historical_and_cultural_perspectives_on_ramayana | Ramayana]] (Yudhkand 108:16 and 108:17), Ram killed [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] by shooting a special arrow directly into his heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

To be a Vibhishan is to be a nonconformist, choosing the path of right over loyalty to wrongdoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Ravan]] and [[ravans_character_and_his_portrayal_in_the_ramayana | Kumbhkaran's]] evil deeds, not Vibhishan, were the true cause of Lanka's downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

The Pahalgam Terrorist Attack (2025)
On an unspecified date in 2025, a terrorist attack occurred in the Baisaran Valley of Pahalgam, known as India's mini Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This incident reportedly killed at least 26 people and injured 17, with all fatalities being male <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Casualties and Targeting
The victims included 24 Hindus, one Christian, and one Muslim (Syed Adil Hussain Shah, a local mule handler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Tourists from various places, including Jaipur and Nepal, were among the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Several Indian armed forces and intelligence officers were also present at the site, including Indian Air Force Corporal Tage Hailyang, Intelligence Bureau Section Officer Manish Ranjan, and Indian Navy Lieutenant Vinay Narwal, who was on his honeymoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Eyewitness accounts describe terrorists asking victims about their religion before shooting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. One account stated a father was shot after failing to recite Islamic verses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Rescue and Aftermath
Due to the high-altitude location, rescue operations required helicopters and mules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Locals, particularly mule handlers, played a crucial role in transporting the injured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Injured tourists were admitted to Pahalgam Hospital, with 12 reported to be in stable condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The Indian Army arrived approximately 20 minutes after the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Perpetrators
The Resistance Front (TRF), a shadow group of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. TRF was declared a terrorist organization by the Ministry of Home Affairs under UAPA's framework two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Sheikh Sajjad Gul, a member of this group, was also designated a terrorist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Intelligence assessments suspect Lashkar-e-Taiba's top commander, Saifullah Kasuri, as one of the conspirators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Initial probes suggest 4-6 terrorists carried out the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. J&K police released sketches of three Pakistani attackers based on eyewitness statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Government sources indicate that two Kashmiri youths, Adil Guri and Ahsan, who went to Pakistan in 2018, might have infiltrated India with Pakistani terrorists and were among the attackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Intelligence Failures and Security Concerns
The Pahalgam attack raises [[security_issues_in_india | security issues in India]] and questions about intelligence effectiveness, as prior inputs about terrorists scoping out hotels in the area existed in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This suggests that despite intelligence, the attack still occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

#### Parallels with Pulwama Attack (2019)
The situation draws parallels to the 2019 Pulwama attack, where the Ministry of State for Home Affairs, G. Kishan Reddy, claimed no intelligence failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, a Frontline investigation revealed 11 intelligence inputs between January 2 and February 13, 2019, warning of a 'Qisas' (revenge) attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Specific warnings included:
*   **January 24, 2019**: An input reported Mudasir Ahmad Khan's plan for a 'Fidayeen' attack and his contact with the Shahid Baba Group, which included Pulwama bomber Adil Ahmad Dar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **January 25, 2019**: Information about Mudasir Ahmad Khan's location with four foreign mercenaries in Midoora and Lam Tral villages, and their plans for an attack in Awantipora or Pampore, near Pulwama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **February 12, 2019**: A 'Top Secret' input about a Twitter handle hinting at IED blasts on J&K's security forces' route, including a video demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **February 13, 2019**: A final warning with similar information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Despite these warnings, over 2,500 soldiers were refused airlifting and sent in a single convoy, a decision later criticized by the former IG of CRPF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

#### Government Responsibility
The responsibility for national security rests with the elected government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Questions are raised regarding the effectiveness of government policies, such as Prime Minister Modi's claim that demonetization would break the back of terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Since then, multiple terrorist attacks have occurred in Jammu and Kashmir, including:
*   Nagrota Army Base attack (November 2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
*   Amarnath Yatra attack (July 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   Sunjuwan Military Station attack (February 2018) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
*   Pulwama attack (February 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>
*   Jammu Bus Stand grenade blast (March 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
*   Indian Paramilitary Police attack in Awantipora (June 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>
*   Poonch Rajouri attack (2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   Reasi attack (2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>
*   Pahalgam attack (2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>

There is a perceived lack of accountability, as seen after the 26/11 Mumbai attack, when Home Minister Shivraj Patil and Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh resigned due to public demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In the current climate, media figures like Arnab Goswami have blamed the Supreme Court rather than the government for security issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Resource Allocation and Personnel Shortages
A significant concern for [[security_issues_in_india | security issues in India]] is the shortage of personnel in the armed forces. The Defence Ministry reported to the Parliament's Standing Committee that the army has 42,095 officers against an authorized strength of 50,538, a deficit of about 8,400 officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Additionally, there is a shortage of 92,400 soldiers, leading to a total deficit of over 100,000 army personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

This shortage is attributed to a halt in army recruitment during the two years of COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Despite the existing deficit, there are plans to further reduce army strength by 200,000 over the next three years, reportedly to cut salary and pension expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This has led to allegations that the government is prioritizing cost savings over troop strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The sister of Lieutenant Vinay Narwal, a victim of the Pahalgam attack, claimed that her brother could have been saved if the army had been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

#### VIP Security vs. Civilian Security
Contrasting with the lack of security for common citizens, billionaires like Mukesh Ambani and Bollywood celebrities receive high-level Y+ and Z+ security covers, funded by taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This disparity leads to questions about the value placed on the lives of common people, who face risks from train accidents, stampedes, falling infrastructure, and terrorist attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

#### Police Workforce
There is a call to double the number of police personnel and improve training facilities to enhance law and order and [[security_issues_in_india | citizen security in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Political and Social Responses
While Home Minister Amit Shah vowed to punish those responsible for the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, questions remain about government solutions to prevent future attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Kashmir's Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attack and expressed condolences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Kashmiris observed a shutdown and held unity marches and candlelight vigils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Muslim organizations like Jamat-Ulama-e-Hind and the All India Imam Organisation condemned the attack, with calls for anti-terror messages from mosques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Several Muslim countries also condemned the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

However, concerns were raised about the BJP Chhattisgarh's social media post following the attack, which used the tragedy to highlight religious divisions, stating "They asked for the religion not the caste," "We'll remember." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

The conflict that began in October last year with [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Hamas's attack]] on Israel has expanded, involving various paramilitary groups and "te*rorist outfits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and Houthis, are considered proxies for Iran and are collectively known as the "Axis of Resistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Iran provides them with funding and support "behind the scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Key Paramilitary Groups

### Hamas
[[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Hamas]], based in Gaza, initiated the current war by attacking Israel on October 7, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This group is considered an Iranian proxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Hezbollah
Hezbollah is a Shia militant group operating primarily in South Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. It is one of the most heavily armed non-state groups globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, often more powerful than Lebanon's own army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

**Origins and Objectives:**
Hezbollah emerged in 1982 when Israel invaded Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. In 1985, they formalized their existence with a manifesto demanding the eradication of Western powers from Lebanon and the destruction of the Israeli state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Most Western countries, including the US and European nations, classify Hezbollah as a "te*rorist organisation," although the Indian government does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

**Historical and Recent Conflicts:**
*   Hezbollah was instrumental in pushing Israel out of Southern Lebanon in 2000, following Israel's 22-year occupation of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   A 34-day war between Hezbollah and Israel occurred in 2006, with no clear victor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   On October 8, 2023, the day after the [[recent_attacks_by_hamas_on_israel | Hamas attack]], Hezbollah officially declared a state of war against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   The war between Hezbollah and Israel has been ongoing openly for several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   Hezbollah's daily rocket fires on the Israeli-Lebanese border have forced over 80,000 Israelis to evacuate their cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   In September, several high-profile Hezbollah leaders and operatives were assassinated, including Ibrahim Akil, commander of Hezbollah's Special Operations Forces Unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>; Hezbollah's missile unit leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>; and top leader Hassan Nasrallah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. These assassinations were suspected to be carried out by Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   Despite these losses, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon continue, with Hezbollah also launching rockets towards Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

### Houthis
The Houthis, based in Yemen, were founded in the 1990s due to Shia marginalization and increasing foreign influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. They are considered a "te*rorist organisation" by many countries, though not by the Indian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. They oppose Yemen's government, which is supported by Saudi Arabia and Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Besides Iran, Russia is also said to fund the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

**Impact on Trade:**
The Houthis have disrupted the Red Sea by attacking passing ships with missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This has resulted in significant trade losses, estimated at nearly $1 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | Geopolitical Alliances and Proxy Wars]]
The involvement of these groups highlights the complex [[geopolitical_alliances_and_proxy_wars_in_the_middle_east | geopolitical alliances and proxy wars in the Middle East]]. Iran supports rebel groups or opposition factions in Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, while Saudi Arabia and Western countries often support the respective governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Internationally, Western countries, including the US and EU, tend to favor Saudi Arabia, while Russia and China often support Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This dynamic explains why Saudi Arabia frequently takes a stand against Iran, despite both being Muslim countries (Saudi Arabia is Sunni-dominated, and Iran is Shia-dominated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## [[iran_and_israel_conflict_and_missile_attacks | Iran's Direct Involvement]]
Prior to April, Iran was not directly involved in the war, operating primarily through its proxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, a turning point occurred on April 1, when Israel conducted an airstrike on Syria's capital, Damascus, resulting in the deaths of seven Iranian officers, including a top general from the Iranian embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Israel claimed the building was a military facility and the officer had links to Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Iran responded with a massive missile and drone attack on Israel on April 13, launching over 300 drones and missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This was the first time in decades that another country had directly attacked Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The order for this attack was given directly by Iran's Head of State, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

More recently, after a series of assassinations of high-profile Hamas and Hezbollah leaders (suspected to be by Israel) in July and September, Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani stated that these strikes were a "limited act of self-defence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Iran's latest missile attack on October 1, consisting of more than 180 ballistic missiles, was cited by an Iranian news agency as retaliation for the assassination of Hezbollah's leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## [[international_reactions_and_implications_of_the_conflict | International Reactions]]
The United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting after the April attack, with the Secretary-General urging both sides to de-escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The UN and USA have consistently condemned the escalating attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. India has expressed deep concern at the escalation, advocating for dialogue and diplomacy, and advising its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar stated that while India understands [[israels_military_response_and_international_reactions | Israel's need to respond]], any response must adhere to international humanitarian laws and ensure no damage to civilian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

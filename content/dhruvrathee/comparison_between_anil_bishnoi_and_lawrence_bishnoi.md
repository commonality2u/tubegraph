While some individuals on social media mistakenly praise a "Bishnoi" as "India's new Bhagat Singh," they often confuse two very different people: Anil Bishnoi and Lawrence Bishnoi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This article highlights the stark contrast between these two figures and their impact on society.

## Anil Bishnoi: A Champion of Wildlife

Anil Bishnoi is a 51-year-old farmer from Laksar, a village in Rajasthan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. His story, published in 'The Better India', exemplifies a life dedicated to conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

He developed a passion for saving wild animals like blackbucks after witnessing their monthly deaths in his district <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A conference by the Bishnoi community on forest and wildlife loss during his college years transformed his life's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

After completing his studies, Anil Bishnoi returned to his village, determined to protect blackbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Despite being only 20, he began gathering information on hunts from villagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. His first notable action involved a 30 km motorcycle ride on a cold winter night to intervene in a hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Though the deer was already hunted, he called the police, leading to the hunter's arrest and a case filed under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Act, 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

In another instance, he confronted hunters alone and had a gun pointed at his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Despite initial fear, he stood his ground, believing it necessary to risk his life for the species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The police eventually intervened, leading to the hunter's arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

His dedication extends beyond confronting hunters, as he addresses other causes of blackbuck deaths, such as road accidents, extreme climates, and dog attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

## Lawrence Bishnoi: A Life of Crime

In stark contrast, Lawrence Bishnoi, who studied in a college in Chandigarh, became involved in student politics that quickly escalated into violence and crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### [[Lawrence Bishnois criminal activities and gang involvement | Lawrence Bishnois criminal activities and gang involvement]]

Lawrence Bishnoi's path diverged sharply from that of a law-abiding citizen:
*   **Early Criminal Acts**: Police records show he set fire to a rival candidate's car after a student politics election fight, leading to his arrest with eight friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. While in jail, he met a weapons supplier, and upon release, his criminal activities continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **Student Politics and Crime**: After losing an election for Student Organisation President of Punjab University in 2010, he allegedly attacked his rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. He won the election in 2011, despite facing 18 charges during his college years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Law Degree**: Although he obtained a law degree in 2012, he became an accused in court rather than a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   **Escalation to Gang Leadership**: By 2013, he was allegedly involved in the killing of a rival nominee during a campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. He was caught by police in 2014 and escaped custody in 2015, only to be rearrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

*   **Extortion and Rivalries**: Lawrence's enmity with Davinder Bambiha stemmed from conflicts over extortion money and control of the Punjab music industry and Kabaddi players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Extortion involves threatening individuals for their hard-earned money, with promises of protection from other gangs if paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

*   **Notable Murders/Targets**:
    *   **Vicky Middukhera**: Close to Lawrence since student politics, murdered in 2021 by the rival Bambiha Gang for his association with Lawrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>.

### Underworld Influence on the Music Industry

Artists, particularly in the Punjabi music industry, often receive extortion threats once they gain fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. A nexus between students, politicians, and gangsters forces singers to align with one gang or face extortion from rivals, often trapping them in the criminal underworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

### Karni Sena's Bounty on Lawrence Bishnoi

Following the murder of Karni Sena President Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi, for which the Lawrence Gang took responsibility, the Kshatriya Karni Sena announced a reward of ₹11,111,111 for any police officer or even a Sabarmati Jail prisoner who kills Lawrence Bishnoi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The lives of Anil Bishnoi and Lawrence Bishnoi present a stark contrast. While Anil Bishnoi embodies selfless dedication to environmental protection and saving wildlife, Lawrence Bishnoi represents a destructive path of crime, violence, and fear. The transcript emphasizes that the "Gangster Life" often glorified in media is a harsh reality of constant fear, imprisonment, and tragic ends for individuals and their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.

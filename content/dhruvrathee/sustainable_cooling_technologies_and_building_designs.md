Recent years have seen unprecedented heat, with the summer of 2023 described as the hottest in the last 2,000 years in the Northern Hemisphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This trend continued into 2024, with January, February, March, and April all breaking records for their respective months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The last 11 months on Earth have been record-breaking in terms of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While global warming and climate change are primary drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, other local factors and solutions can help mitigate the impact of increasing temperatures. One significant contributor to local heat is the [[Urban Heat Island Effect and urban planning | Urban Heat Island Effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>.

## Addressing the [[Urban Heat Island Effect and urban planning | Urban Heat Island Effect]]

The [[Urban Heat Island Effect and urban planning | Urban Heat Island Effect]] describes how certain urban areas become significantly hotter than others, and even compared to surrounding rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. This phenomenon is largely due to:
*   **Materials:** Concrete, glass buildings, and asphalt roads absorb sunlight throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This absorbed heat is then released into the air at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.
*   **Lack of Ventilation:** Cities covered in concrete often lack proper ventilation and air circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.
*   **Vehicular Heat:** Cars release heat, contributing to the [[Urban Heat Island Effect and urban planning | Urban Heat Island effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.
*   **Air Conditioner Use:** As outdoor temperatures rise, increased use of air conditioners leads to more heat being expelled outdoors, further warming the surrounding environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

Studies in Delhi found that areas affected by the [[Urban Heat Island Effect and urban planning | urban heat island effect]], such as Connaught Place and Sitaram Bazar, were 3째C to 8째C hotter than places with more trees like Hauz Khas District Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

### Solutions for Urban Cooling

To combat the [[Urban Heat Island Effect and urban planning | Urban Heat Island Effect]], several local solutions can be implemented:

*   **Greenery:** Planting more trees and creating parks can significantly reduce temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. This is why developing a "web of roads" in a city should not be the sole indicator of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.
*   **Urban Planning:** Cities should be designed with proper walkable areas and sufficient greenery to make outdoor temperatures comfortable for pedestrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. This encourages less reliance on cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:29">[01:16:29]</a>.
*   **Car Bans and Public Transport:** Initiatives like those in Paris, where cars have been largely banned from the city center, asphalt removed, and trees planted, help reduce the [[Urban Heat Island Effect and urban planning | Urban Heat Island Effect]] and promote cycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>. Promoting public transport is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.

> "In a city if there are more places where cars are completely banned, it would be better for people." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>

## Sustainable Building Designs

Sustainable building design is another key area for mitigating heat, focusing on reducing reliance on energy-intensive cooling systems like air conditioners.

*   **Natural Ventilation:** Buildings should incorporate ventilation into their design to minimize the need for ACs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. Historically, structures in places like Dubai featured towers designed for air circulation within buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This is an [[Innovations and Technologies in Skyscraper Design | innovation and technology in skyscraper design]] that has roots in traditional architecture.
*   **Reflective Surfaces (White Roofs):** Painting roofs white can reflect sunlight, making a difference of 2째C to 3째C inside a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This simple solution applies to both urban and rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Green Roofs:** Planting grass or growing trees on roofs can also serve as an alternative to white paint for cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

### [[Innovations and Technologies in Skyscraper Design | Radiant Cooling]] Technology

For modern cooling needs, [[Innovations and Technologies in Skyscraper Design | Radiant Cooling]] is a sustainable alternative to traditional air conditioning.

*   **Mechanism:** This technology involves installing pipes in walls through which cold water flows, cooling the house without the need for an AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedent:** While considered a new technology, its concept is similar to ancient methods used in forts and monuments like the Taj Mahal, which utilized water channels around buildings to cool the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** [[Innovations and Technologies in Skyscraper Design | Radiant Cooling]] not only keeps cities cooler but also significantly reduces electricity bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## [[Future Prospects for Taller Buildings | Future Prospects]]

The urgency for implementing these sustainable solutions is high, as projections indicate that heat waves are expected to become more dangerous and impactful in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. A recent study on [[Future Prospects for Taller Buildings | Future Projections]] for the Tropical Indian Ocean showed that permanent marine heat waves could be seen in the Indian Ocean within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. By 2050, many areas could experience heat waves lasting 220 to 250 days a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. The implementation of these cooling technologies and design principles is essential for making cities livable in the face of these [[extreme_heatwaves_and_recordbreaking_temperatures_in_india_and_southeast_asia | extreme heatwaves and record-breaking temperatures]].

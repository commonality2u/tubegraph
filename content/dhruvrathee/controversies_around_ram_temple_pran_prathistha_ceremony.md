The [[Ram Mandir inauguration in Ayodhya | Ram Mandir]] in Ayodhya was inaugurated on January 22nd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> with the Praan Pratistha ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Praan means life and Pratistha means establishment, referring to the installation of an idol inside the temple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This event sparked widespread media discussion and numerous [[political_reactions_to_the_ram_mandir_event | controversies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Many prominent figures, including several political parties and all four Shankaracharyas, did not attend the ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. In contrast, Bollywood celebrities like Katrina Kaif, Rohit Shetty, Ranbir Kapoor, and Alia Bhatt received special invitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Non-attendance of BJP Senior Leaders

Veteran BJP leaders L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, who were key figures in the Ram Mandir Agitation Movement since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, did not attend the inauguration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The general secretary of the Ram Temple Trust stated that they were advised not to come due to their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Reasons for Political Parties' Absence

Several political parties rejected their invitations for various reasons:

*   **CPI(M)**: General Secretary Sitaram Yechury declined, asserting that religion is a personal matter and the government should not be affiliated with any particular religion, upholding secularism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray faction)**: Uddhav Thackeray received an invitation just two days before the event via speed post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. His party member Sanjay Raut criticized BJP, stating they "worship Ram, but rule like [[Temples and worship of Ravan in India | Ravan]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Thackeray chose to visit the Kalaram Temple in Nashik on January 22nd, a place believed to have hosted Lord Rama, Lakshman, and Sita during their exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Congress Party**: Many Congress leaders rejected their invitations, primarily citing that the temple was being inaugurated while still partially incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Their main reason for non-attendance was the accusation that BJP was politicizing the event and using Ram's name for electoral gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This stance was praised by some as a good decision, while others called it a political blunder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Shankaracharyas' Non-attendance

All four principal Shankaracharyas, heads of the four mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya approximately 1,200 years ago, did not attend the ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. These mathas are located in present-day Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Odisha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   **Puri Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati** stated that the ceremony was not in accordance with Hindu scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. He emphasized that the establishment of Ram's idol should follow the Shastras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Uttarakhand Matha Shankaracharya Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati** further explained the scriptural objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. He considers the temple as the body of God, with its peak as the eyes, the pot as the head, and the flag as the hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. According to him, it is not proper to infuse life into a "body" (temple) that lacks its "eyes" or "head" (incomplete structure), thus violating scriptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Defamation Campaigns Against Shankaracharyas

Following their decision, the Shankaracharyas faced relentless defamation from the IT cell on social media, with fake news spreading and some accounts labeling them as "anti-Hindu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

*   **False claims of visiting Ajmer Sharif**: Photos were circulated falsely claiming a Shankaracharya visited Ajmer Sharif, a Muslim religious site, to portray him as anti-Hindu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   Adi Shankaracharya's philosophy of non-duality (Aham Brahmasmi) states God is present everywhere, making visits to mosques or churches consistent with this belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   The news was false; the photo was from a Hindu Ashram, specifically Ramdev Pir's court, considered an avatar of Krishna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati confirmed he had never been to Ajmer city, let alone Ajmer Sharif <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. He also stated that visiting a Dargah would not make him a Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   The narrative contrasts this with [[Controversies and criticism surrounding Narendra Modi | PM Modi]] also having visited a Dargah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **False claims of taking money**: Another baseless rumor alleged that the Shankaracharyas took â‚¹500,000 to reject the invitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The Shankaracharya expressed shock at such defamatory news without evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

The speaker highlights that opposition to BJP or [[Controversies and criticism surrounding Narendra Modi | PM Modi]]'s decisions often leads to defamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. It is suggested that those who certify who is "Hindu" or "anti-Hindu" are not genuinely concerned with Ram's principles, but rather use Ram's name for political purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

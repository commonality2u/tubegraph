Humanity has long pondered if it is the sole [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | intelligent species]] in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. With the possibility that [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | aliens]] might also be asking similar questions about their solitude, NASA has initiated numerous projects to transmit messages to potential extraterrestrial life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Voyager Missions

In 1977, NASA launched its [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] with a mission to explore the solar system, including its outer planets and the heliopause, and to venture into [[interstellar_exploration | interstellar space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Only five [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | interstellar spacecraft]] have been launched by NASA to date: Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]], [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]], and New Horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Of these, only [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] and [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]] have successfully reached [[interstellar_exploration | interstellar space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Mission Design and Trajectory

The timing of the [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager missions]] was critical, leveraging a unique geometric alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune that occurs only once every 175 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This alignment allowed the [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] to use "Gravity Assist," a principle where the mass of a planet changes a [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft's]] speed and trajectory with minimal fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

[[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]] was launched on August 20, 1977, followed by [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] 16 days later on September 5, 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] took a shorter, faster route, reaching Jupiter first in March 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Power and Instruments

Both [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] are powered by three Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs), which convert heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium into electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Solar panels were not viable due to the vast distances and insufficient solar energy beyond Mars and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Each [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | probe]] carries ten scientific instruments, including:
*   A two-camera imaging system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   Spectrometers to measure hydrogen abundance and ultraviolet activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
*   A magnetometer for planetary magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   A high-gain antenna for communication with Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Instruments to measure radiation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>

### Key Discoveries

The [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager missions]] provided groundbreaking [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | discoveries]]:
*   **Jupiter's Rings**: [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] captured clear photos of Jupiter and its moons, revealing Jupiter's rings for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Volcanic Activity on Io**: [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] discovered active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io, the first time humans observed active volcanoes on another planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **New Moons**: The [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager missions]] increased the known number of Jupiter's moons from 13 to 16, and later [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | discoveries]] have brought the total to 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] also discovered three new moons of Saturn: Atlas, Prometheus, and Pandora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Titan**: [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] highlighted Saturn's moon Titan as the only object in our solar system, besides Earth, with clear evidence of liquid water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

After passing Saturn, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]] continued towards Uranus (1986) and Neptune (1989), becoming the first and only man-made object to fly by these planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] changed its trajectory to leave the Ecliptic Plane, accelerating to over 60,000 km per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### The Pale Blue Dot

On February 14, 1990, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] captured the famous "Pale Blue Dot" photo from about 6 billion kilometers away, showing Earth as a small blue speck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. It also took a "family portrait" of the inner solar system, including Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. After these photos, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1's]] cameras were shut down to conserve power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Entering [[interstellar_exploration | Interstellar Space]]

In 2004, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] passed the Termination Shock, where solar wind suddenly decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. The solar wind forms a protective bubble called the Heliosphere, which shields the solar system from [[interstellar_exploration | interstellar radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The outer boundary of this bubble is the Heliopause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

On August 25, 2012, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] officially left the Heliosphere and entered [[interstellar_exploration | Interstellar Space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This was confirmed by its plasma wave instruments, which detected a high electron density compared to the Heliosphere due to [[interstellar_exploration | interstellar wind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. NASA confirmed this milestone in September 2013, making [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] the first man-made object to cross the limits of the solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Coincidentally, this occurred on the same day [[apollo_11_moon_landing_recount | Neil Armstrong]] passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

[[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]] followed six years later, entering [[interstellar_exploration | interstellar space]] on November 5, 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## Messages to Aliens

Both [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] and [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 2]] carry messages intended for [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | aliens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. These efforts were preceded by Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, which carried simpler messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

### The Pioneer Plaque

The Pioneer missions carried a small, gold-anodized aluminum plate known as the Pioneer plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This 15 cm by 23 cm plate has five engraved diagrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>:
*   **Galactic Map**: Shows the Sun's position relative to 14 Pulsars, requiring advanced understanding to decode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Solar System Diagram**: Depicts the Sun and planets, with an arrow pointing to the third planet (Earth) as the origin of the [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   **Spacecraft Silhouette**: A silhouette of the Pioneer [[spacecraft_technology_and_discoveries | spacecraft]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **Human Figures**: Drawings of a man and a woman, attempting to show how humans look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

### The Voyager Golden Record

The messages on the [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager missions]] are much more detailed, stored on 12-inch gold-plated copper discs that serve as phonograph records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. These "Golden Records" carry both voices and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

The contents are divided into four sections:
1.  **Scenes from Earth**: 115 images and diagrams providing information about Earth, its species, and basic mathematical, chemical, and physical definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Images include the composition of Earth's atmosphere, chemical elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus), DNA structures, and microscopic details of cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Notably, no negative aspects of human life, such as conflict, are depicted, presenting an "ideal version of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.
2.  **Greetings from Earth**: Greetings spoken in 55 human languages, along with printed messages from then-American President Jimmy Carter and UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
3.  **Music from Earth**: 28 audio recordings of musical selections from various cultures and eras, including an Indian song based on Raag Bhairavi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
4.  **Sounds of Earth**: 21 audio recordings of natural sounds and human activities, such as winds, waves, and animal calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Decoding the Golden Record

To enable [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | aliens]] to play the phonograph, NASA scientists included instructions in the box using diagrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. However, the storage of images presented a greater challenge. In 1977, storing 115 images on analog disks was not possible with the [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyagers']] limited computer systems (69 KB of data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. NASA projected photos onto a screen, recorded them with a television camera, and converted the video signals into audio waveforms, storing the images in audio form on the disks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. To view these images, [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | aliens]] would need to reverse this complex process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

## The Future of the Voyagers

As of October 2024, [[nasas_voyager_missions | Voyager 1]] is approximately 24.7 billion kilometers from Earth, traveling at over 60,000 km per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Its power supply is gradually depleting, with scientists estimating it might be entirely depleted by 2025, potentially severing communication with Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. However, the Golden Record within it is expected to be preserved indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

Anil Ambani, once the 6th richest person in the world in 2008 with a wealth of $42 billion, has faced a dramatic downfall, accumulating debts to the tune of ₹1,720 billion by 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. His struggles are marked by legal battles, mounting debts from Indian and Chinese banks, and a ban from the Indian securities market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. This decline is deeply intertwined with [[the_ambani_brothers_feud_and_its_impact_on_their_empire | a largely unknown fight]] between him and his elder brother, Mukesh Ambani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Early Career and Family Influence

Initially, under the guidance of their father, Dhirubhai Ambani, Anil took on the role of Reliance's public face, handling public relations, corporate affairs, lobbying, and marketing with the government due to his extroverted nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. However, Dhirubhai showed a clear preference for Mukesh, making him Vice Chairman of Reliance in 1991, while Anil remained Joint Managing Director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

A significant factor influencing [[influence_of_family_dynamics_on_the_Ambani_brothers | family dynamics]] and Dhirubhai's preference was Anil's decision to marry Tina Munim, a glamorous [[financial_inequality_and_inflated_actor_fees_in_bollywood | Bollywood celebrity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The conservative Ambani family initially opposed this marriage, with Dhirubhai even orchestrating an Enforcement Directorate (ED) raid on Tina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Despite the objections, Anil was adamant, and they married in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. In contrast, Mukesh married Neeta Dalal, chosen by his mother, who became the "real daughter-in-law" of the family, while Tina remained an outsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## The Ambani Brothers' Feud and Its Impact

The [[the_ambani_brothers_feud_and_its_impact_on_their_empire | feud between the brothers]] intensified as Mukesh began taking over more of Reliance's activities and placing his loyalists in key positions, especially in the new telecom venture, Reliance Infocomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Anil felt sidelined and unappreciated, despite his role in managing politicians, bureaucrats, and global fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

After Dhirubhai's passing in 2002, tensions escalated, leading to Anil's financial powers being restricted by the Reliance Board in July 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Mukesh was also uncomfortable with Anil's increasing [[role_of_political_connections_in_anil_ambanis_business_decisions | political connections]] with the Samajwadi Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

The feud became public in late 2004, leading to media scrutiny of Mukesh's dealings and corporate governance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The government, including then-Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, had to intervene due to the national impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

In June 2005, a family agreement was reached, largely arbitrated by their mother Kokilaben, dividing the Reliance empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Mukesh received flagship companies like RIL, while Anil received Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Energy, and Reliance Capital, along with a 10-year non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Mukesh broadly received 60%-70% of the assets, and Anil 30%-40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Initially, Anil's net worth tripled to $45 billion by 2007, nearing Mukesh's $49 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Major Business Setbacks

Anil's initial boom was short-lived.

### Reliance Power IPO and MTN Deal
In January 2008, Anil Ambani launched Reliance Power's IPO, raising ₹120 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. The stock crashed by nearly 20% the very next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Anil claimed Mukesh's companies were behind this, selling shares through Mauritius-based entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

Another major setback was the failed merger of his Reliance Communications with South African telecom company MTN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Mukesh opposed the deal, citing the non-compete agreement's "right of first refusal" clause, ultimately causing MTN to back out due to the infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

### Other Contract Losses
Anil Ambani's company, despite being the highest bidder, lost the privatization contract for Delhi and Mumbai airports due to an alleged conflict of interest, which he attributed to Mukesh's political pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Similar issues arose with coal-based methane extraction contracts, further solidifying Anil's belief that Mukesh was behind his business failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## The Gas Wars and Legal Battles

The most significant [[mukesh_and_anil_ambanis_legal_battles_over_business_conflicts | legal battles]] stemmed from the "Gas Wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. The 2005 settlement granted Mukesh gas exploration rights and Anil power generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Mukesh had promised to supply gas to Anil's Dadri power plant at $2.34 per unit, but the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas intervened, insisting the government sets natural resource prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

In 2007, an empowered group of ministers approved a gas price of $4.21, nearly double the agreed rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Anil took the matter to court, with the Bombay High Court initially ruling in his favor in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. However, Mukesh's company appealed to the Supreme Court, and the government also filed a petition asserting its right to determine gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Anil accused the UPA government and the Petroleum Ministry of favoring Mukesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

During this period, a shocking incident occurred: Anil Ambani's helicopter was found sabotaged with stones and pebbles in its fuel tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. The technician who discovered it was later found dead, fueling speculation about corporate rivalries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that gas is national property and only the government can decide its price, overturning the Bombay High Court's decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. This judgment severely impacted Anil Ambani's companies, causing their share prices to crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. In May 2010, the brothers officially scrapped their non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

## Dadri Power Project Failure

Anil's ambitious Dadri power project, which necessitated the gas supply, also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Land acquisition for the project, initially pushed through by the UP government using emergency provisions and ignoring farmers' rights, faced legal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. In 2009, the Allahabad High Court ruled in favor of the farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. By 2014, Anil informed the Supreme Court of his disinterest in the project due to gas supply difficulties and agreed to return the land, incurring billions in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

## Telecom Business Challenges

Anil's telecom business, Reliance Communications, faced severe challenges. Inheriting a competitive sector that required massive investment, Anil's decision to focus on CDMA technology proved costly, as it was incompatible with 4G advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. His company accumulated ₹300 billion in debt from 3G investments alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

Further troubles included:
*   A failed ₹500 billion merger deal with GTL Infratech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

By 2017, Reliance Communications' debt had reached ₹430 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

## Mounting Debts and Legal Troubles

The debt continued to mount, leading to creditors chasing Anil Ambani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. In 2018, Ericsson sued him for default, and the Supreme Court gave him a deadline to repay ₹5.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. Faced with potential imprisonment for contempt of court, Mukesh Ambani intervened at their mother's request, paying off the dues and saving Anil from jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

In September 2019, Reliance Communications was declared insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. Anil's companies started accruing significant debts from 2014, reaching ₹1,720 billion by 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. His business decisions were described as driven by ambition rather than strategy, often relying on [[role_of_political_connections_in_anil_ambanis_business_decisions | political connections]] to secure funding from public sector banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

To manage debt, he sold assets like the Big Cinemas multiplex chain in 2014 and the Mumbai City Power Distribution business to Gautam Adani in 2018 for ₹188 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. Despite these sales, many of his power generation projects remain stuck due to issues like gas supply, tying up investments of ₹1,200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

Unlike Mukesh, who received core businesses like oil and gas with stable cash flows, Anil inherited "cash-hungry" businesses requiring constant innovation and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. His success was dependent on a continuous flow of funding, which dried up after the 2008 global financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

In 2020, three Chinese banks filed a lawsuit in London's High Court against Anil for an unpaid loan of $925 million taken in 2012 for Reliance Communications, for which he was a personal guarantor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Anil claimed his net worth was zero and he had nothing left to sell, but the judge refused to believe him, suggesting undeclared assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

In February 2022, SEBI banned Anil Ambani from being associated as a director in any listed entity due to diversion of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. He resigned from the Boards of Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power in March 2022, and in August 2023, SEBI banned him from the Indian security market for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

## Current Status

Today, Anil Ambani is rarely seen publicly, reportedly embracing a more religious and spiritual life, having given up on material success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. He has been advised to declare bankruptcy but hesitates, hoping for a future comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. His story serves as a stark contrast to the [[jamsetji_tatas_business_ethics_and_innovations | Tata family]]'s business approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

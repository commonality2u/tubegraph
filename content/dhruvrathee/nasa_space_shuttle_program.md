The Space Shuttle Program, officially known as the Space Transportation System (STS), was a human spaceflight program developed by NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:16">[06:16:16]</a>. It marked the fourth program in human spaceflight, following Project Mercury, Project Gemini, and the [[Apollo program | Apollo program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:25">[06:25:25]</a>. The STS program began in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:31">[06:31:31]</a> and became the longest human spaceflight program in history, running until 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:34">[06:34:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:38">[06:38:38]</a>.

## Program Philosophy: Reusability

A primary focus of the NASA Space Shuttle Program was reusability, aiming to launch the same space shuttle multiple times to avoid the need for building new shuttles for each mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:39">[06:39:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:42">[06:42:42]</a>. The STS program was specifically designed for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:18">[07:18:18]</a>. After every flight, a thorough process of inspection, repair, and refurbishment was conducted on the shuttles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:23">[07:23:23]</a>. The concept of reusability itself was not deemed faulty and was not the cause of the [[columbia_space_shuttle_disaster | Columbia disaster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:17">[07:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:34">[07:34:34]</a>.

## Space Shuttles

The program primarily utilized two main space shuttles initially:
*   **Challenger** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:50">[06:50:50]</a>
*   **[[columbia_space_shuttle_disaster | Columbia Space Shuttle]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:51">[06:51:51]</a> â€“ The Columbia was the first space shuttle to journey into space in April 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:01">[07:01:01]</a>. It successfully completed 27 missions before its final, tragic flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:06">[07:06:06]</a>.

Following the [[columbia_space_shuttle_disaster | Columbia disaster]], other space shuttles, including Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavor, were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:53">[06:53:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:55">[06:55:55]</a>. Many of these shuttles are now preserved in museums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:58">[06:58:58]</a>.

## Notable Missions and Experiments

### STS-87 (First Flight of Kalpana Chawla)
In November 1997, Kalpana Chawla embarked on her first space flight aboard the Columbia, as part of the STS-87 mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:57">[05:57:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:38">[07:38:38]</a>. During this 2-week mission, she orbited the Earth more than 250 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:14">[06:14:14]</a>. As a Mission Specialist and the main operator of the robotic arm, her role included deploying the Spartan satellite, intended for studying the sun's outer layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:44">[07:44:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:47">[07:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:49">[07:49:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:52">[07:52:52]</a>. An initial issue where the 1,360 kg satellite went out of control was later determined not to be her fault, but rather another crew member's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:04">[08:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:06">[08:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:25">[08:25:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:27">[08:27:27]</a>.

### STS-107 (Final Flight of Columbia)
The STS-107 mission, the final flight of the Columbia Space Shuttle, launched on January 16, 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:32">[09:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:35">[09:35:35]</a>. Originally planned for 2001, the mission experienced 13 delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:46">[09:46:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:49">[09:49:49]</a>. The crew of seven astronauts, led by Commander Rick Husband, included Kalpana Chawla as a Mission Specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:57">[09:57:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:02">[10:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:05">[10:05:05]</a>.

For 16 days, the crew conducted approximately 80 experiments around the clock in shifts, focusing on life sciences, material science, and fluid physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:16">[10:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:22">[10:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:25">[10:25:25]</a>. Kalpana Chawla's focus was on microgravity, studying combustion, fire suppression, crystal growth, and even prostate cancer growth in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:31">[10:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:33">[10:33:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:36">[10:36:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:38">[10:38:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:39">[10:39:39]</a>. A collaboration with Spacehab allowed universities, companies, and government agencies globally to conduct research in space through these astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:05">[11:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:09">[11:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:13">[11:13:13]</a>. Experiments requested by children from six schools in Australia, China, Israel, Japan, and the USA were also performed, observing reactions of spiders, silkworms, fish, bees, and ants in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:20">[11:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:25">[11:25:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:29">[11:29:29]</a>. A peculiar discovery was that the scent of flowers changes in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:41">[11:41:41]</a>.

Approximately 30% of the experiment data was transmitted to Earth and saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:50">[11:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:53">[11:53:53]</a>. Remarkably, a live group of roundworms, stored in aluminum canisters, survived the [[columbia_space_shuttle_disaster | disaster]] with minor heat damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:15">[12:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:18">[12:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:21">[12:21:21]</a>. Descendants of these roundworms were later sent on the Space Shuttle Endeavour, the second-to-last STS program mission in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:32">[12:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:34">[12:34:34]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Program

The Space Shuttle Program was continued until the International Space Station became fully functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:40">[18:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:43">[18:43:43]</a>. It officially concluded in July 2011, having carried out 135 missions over its 30-year span <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:46">[18:46:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:49">[18:49:49]</a>. Over these three decades, 14 astronauts tragically lost their lives in accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:56">[18:56:56]</a>.

NASA has paid tribute to the crew members, including Kalpana Chawla, by naming the Mars landing site "Columbia Memorial Station" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:45">[19:45:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:49">[19:49:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:52">[19:52:52]</a>. Numerous asteroids between Mars and Jupiter have also been named after the crew members, including "51826 Kalpana Chawla" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:55">[19:55:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:58">[19:58:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:01">[20:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:04">[20:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:06">[20:06:06]</a>.

The Budget 2024, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23rd, 2024, elicited significant public backlash, even from staunch supporters of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A common sentiment among the furious public was that the government appeared eager to extract money from the middle class while extending continuous benefits to its millionaire and billionaire allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Critics highlighted that [[financial_inequality_and_inflated_actor_fees_in_bollywood | income inequality]] in the nation had worsened to levels not seen even during the British Raj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Public Reaction to Budget 2024

Public sentiment rapidly shifted, with individuals who previously supported a "dictator Modi" by June 17th, by July 23rd were expressing dismay and asking not to be treated like beggars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Others who felt "Now I can die peacefully" on June 9th, by July 23rd, labelled it "Worst government I have seen in terms of tax issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Comedian Abhijit Ganguly's viral tweet summarized the frustration: taxes are levied on earnings, spending, and even investments, with an additional cess on the tax amount itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

A viral flowchart illustrating the tax logic showed a 30% direct tax on salary, 20% tax on short-term investment returns (12.5% for slower earnings), and GST ranging from 12% on basic items to 28% on luxury items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## [[Impact of Capital Gains Tax Changes | Capital Gains Tax Changes]]

The most heavily criticized aspect of the budget was the changes to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. CGT is levied on profits from selling assets like property or investments such as stocks and mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

There are two types of CGT:
*   **Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG):** Applies to assets bought and sold within one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** Applies to investments held for more than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Increases in Capital Gains Tax
The new budget increased both STCG and LTCG taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:
*   **STCG** increased by 5%, from 15% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **LTCG** increased by 2.5%, from 10% to 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
However, the exemption limit for LTCG was raised from ₹100,000 to ₹125,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

These changes directly impact individuals investing in the stock market or mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Traders in Futures and Options also faced bad news, with Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on Futures increasing from 0.0125% to 0.02% of the transaction value, and on Options increasing from 0.0625% to 0.1% of the option premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Government's Justification for CGT Increase
The government's rationale for increasing these taxes might be found in the Economic Survey of 2023-2024, presented on July 22nd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Page 65 of the survey states that "If equity market claims on the real economy are excessively high, it is a harbinger of market instability rather than market resilience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This suggests the government views the stock market as turning into a bubble, and excessive growth could lead to instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

This marks a shift from the government's previous stance, where a growing stock market was often presented as an indicator of national development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The current policy aims to discourage excessive stock market activity, particularly risky Futures and Options trading, which often leads to significant losses for uninformed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Tax Changes on Non-Financial Assets (Property)

For non-financial assets like land or property, the LTCG tax rate appears to have decreased from 20% to 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. However, the government has removed the indexation benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Impact of Removing Indexation Benefit
Indexation adjusted the cost of acquisition for inflation, reducing the taxable capital gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. For example, a house bought for ₹2 million twenty years ago, whose inflation-adjusted value is ₹6 million today, would have had its LTCG calculated on the profit above ₹6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. With indexation removed, the original ₹2 million will be the baseline, leading to a much higher taxable gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This change does not apply to properties bought before 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

#### Example Calculation:
If a property was bought in 2004 for ₹2 million and sold in 2024 for ₹12.4 million (assuming a 9.3% annual increase in housing prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>):
*   **Old System (with indexation):** The inflation-adjusted cost (using CII) would be ₹6.42 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Taxable gain: ₹12.4 million - ₹6.42 million = ₹6 million (approx) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. LTCG tax at 20%: ₹1.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **New System (without indexation):** Taxable gain: ₹12.4 million - ₹2 million = ₹10.4 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. LTCG tax at 12.5%: ₹1.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

In this realistic scenario, the new system results in a loss of about ₹100,000 for the taxpayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This has raised concerns that people may resort to cash dealings, increasing black money circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Those who invested in delayed housing projects over the past 2-3 years, where properties haven't appreciated drastically, will suffer further losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Discouraging Property Speculation
The government's intention behind this policy change is likely to reduce speculation in property prices and curb a "Real Estate bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This could potentially make housing more affordable for the lower-middle class who are struggling to buy their first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The policy contrasts with statements from figures like Manoj Tiwari, who during elections, spoke of increasing property values by 2-3 times in his constituency, which would benefit wealthy multi-property owners but negatively impact first-time homebuyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Angel Tax Abolition

The budget proposed the removal of Angel Tax, which was levied on startups issuing fresh shares at a price higher than their fair market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This decision was widely praised, even by opposition parties, who claimed they had long advocated for its removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

## Income Tax Modifications and Inequality

Minor changes were made to Income Tax, primarily benefiting the middle class on a small scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. The Standard Deduction increased from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Income tax slabs were also adjusted, for instance, the 5% tax rate now applies up to ₹700,000 (previously ₹600,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. However, the overall benefit for a middle-class citizen is considered negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

Historically, between 2006 and 2012, previous governments frequently increased the 0% and 20% slab rates to aid the middle class, a practice largely absent in the last 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Similarly, LTCG tax was 0% in 2004 under Dr. Manmohan Singh's premiership and was only reintroduced by the Modi government in 2018, now further increased to 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

A major criticism persists regarding the uniform 30% tax rate applicable to both individuals earning more than ₹1.5 million and those earning over ₹10 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This contributes to the perception that the government favors millionaires and billionaires, often leading to it being labeled as the "Adani-Ambani government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Shift in Government Revenue Sources

Analysis of the budget document reveals a significant shift in government revenue sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   Income Tax contributes 19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   GST contributes 18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   Corporate Tax contributes merely 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Before 2014-15, corporate tax was the primary source of government revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Over the years, corporate tax has been gradually reduced, with a greater emphasis placed on collecting taxes from individual income tax payers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Government Schemes and Implementation Concerns

The Finance Minister announced five schemes with an outlay of ₹2 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>:
1.  **First Time Employment Support:** Up to ₹15,000 for first-time job seekers registered with EPFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
2.  **Manufacturing Sector Benefits:** More benefits for employees and employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
3.  **Employer Support:** Government contribution of up to ₹3,000 per month for two years in EPFO for employers who hire more employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
4.  **Skilling Scheme:** To skill 2 million youth in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
5.  **Internship Opportunities:** One million youth to receive 12-month internships in top 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

The internship scheme was notably also part of the Congress manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. However, concerns remain about the implementation of these schemes, as the Finance Minister indicated they would be a "nudge" rather than compulsory for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## [[Regional Budget Allocations and Political Implications | Regional Budget Allocations]]

The budget saw criticism for its distribution of funds among different states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Andhra Pradesh and Bihar received significant allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   ₹150 billion for the development of Amravati, the capital of Andhra Pradesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   ₹600 billion for various infrastructure projects in Bihar, including expressways, power plants, and new airports, along with ₹115 billion for flood mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. Bihar also received the largest share under the Tourism Budget, with plans for world-class facilities at Vishnupad Mandir and Mahabodhi Mandir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

This disproportionate allocation is seen as the BJP government's attempt to appease its allies, TDP and JDU, especially with upcoming elections in Bihar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Rahul Gandhi termed this a "Seat Conservation Budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, contrasting with the past favoritism shown towards Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## Conclusion: Intensifying Income Inequality

The budget highlights a worsening trend of [[financial_inequality_and_inflated_actor_fees_in_bollywood | income inequality]] in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Data shows that the share of income for the top 10% has consistently increased, while the middle class's share has decreased over the past 10-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. The current level of income inequality is described as worse than during the British Raj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

To address this, the government needs to prioritize the growth of the middle class and promote small businesses over large corporate entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. There is a strong argument for taxing billionaires more instead of burdening the middle class, which could lead to better resource distribution and environmental preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The future impact of these new government policies on [[economic_disparities_and_political_propaganda_in_india | economic disparities]] remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

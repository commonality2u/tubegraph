On November 24, 1971, the [[db_cooper_hijacking_incident | DB Cooper hijacking incident]] unfolded on a Northwest Orient Airlines flight from Portland to Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A man identifying himself as Dan Cooper (later mistakenly known as [[the_mystery_and_unresolved_questions_about_db_cooper | DB Cooper]]) hijacked the plane, claiming to have a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The airline's president, Donald Nairob, made the decision to comply fully with Cooper's demands to avoid negative publicity and financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Initial Investigation and Evidence Gathering

After coordinating with the FBI, a Seattle bank was contacted to arrange the $200,000 in cash that Cooper demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The money consisted of 10,000 $20 bills, totaling $200,000, and the serial numbers of these notes were meticulously recorded by the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

After Cooper jumped from the plane over Washington State, the FBI was informed and immediately began their [[investigation_of_airplane_accidents | investigation of airplane accidents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Upon inspecting the aircraft in Reno, police found no trace of Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. The only items left behind were a tie with a clip, some torn parts of parachutes (which Cooper used to cover the money bag), and personal items like cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Investigators also found 66 unidentified fingerprints belonging to neither the crew nor the passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. However, Cooper's briefcase, the money bag, and the parachutes he used were all missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

The FBI officially began its investigation to find Cooper, which continued for 45 years until its official closure in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Despite the extensive efforts, the case remains unsolved, making it one of the greatest mysteries for the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Locating Cooper and the Search Area

Initially, investigators believed there was "no chance of Cooper surviving" the jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. This assessment was based on several factors:
*   **Altitude and Darkness**: Jumping from 10,000 feet in pitch darkness at 8 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Weather Conditions**: Wearing unsuitable clothes (pants and shirt) in the rain, with heavy black clouds at 5,000 feet, impairing visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.
*   **Wind Speed**: The estimated wind speed at the time of the jump was 320 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
*   **Cold Water and Weight**: The very low November temperatures in the region meant that falling into a lake would quickly lead to hypothermia within minutes, compounded by the 10kg weight of the cash strapped to Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

However, the FBI's perspective shifted when several copycat hijackers, who used similar tactics, survived their jumps, even under worse conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. The fact that Cooper dismissed instructions for using the parachutes, claiming he "knew how to use them," also suggested he might have survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.

Defining the precise search area was a major challenge for the FBI due to numerous variables: unknown wind speed, darkness, exact plane location at the jump, and the height and direction of parachute deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Their best estimate placed the landing near Lake Merwin in Washington State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. To refine this, the FBI conducted a practical experiment, pushing a 91 kg sled out of a Boeing 727 flying under similar configurations to estimate the landing zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

Extensive search efforts were conducted: door-to-door inquiries in local farmhouses, petrol boats on Lake Merwin and Lake Yale, and even a company using a submarine to search 200 feet under Lake Merwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. Despite these efforts, no body, parachute pieces, or money were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

## The Discovery of Money and its Impact

To encourage public assistance, the FBI published the serial numbers of the stolen notes in local newspapers, offering a $1,000 reward for the first person to find one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. This offer remained for three years, but no notes were found during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.

In 1979, pilot Tom Bohan, who had been flying 4 minutes behind Cooper's aircraft on the night of the hijacking, contacted the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. Bohan claimed the FBI's drop zone calculations were off by 80 degrees and suggested searching near the drainage area of the Washougal River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.

A few months later, Bohan's suspicion was confirmed when an 8-year-old boy found $5,800 in $20 bills on the bank of the Columbia River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. These notes, some still in bundles with rubber bands, matched the serial numbers of the money given to Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. While this discovery validated Bohan's hypothesis about Cooper's landing area, further searches yielded no additional money, body, or parachute pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. FBI agent Richard Tosaw believed Cooper must have drowned in the river's cold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>.

## Identifying Cooper: Sketches, Forensics, and Suspects

One of the central questions for the FBI was [[theories_and_suspects_in_the_db_cooper_case | DB Cooper's identity]]. They had limited information to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>. A key piece of evidence was the golden tie clip left behind, which contained specific microscopic particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>. In 2009, a research team used new technology, including electron microscopy, to analyze these particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. They found unalloyed titanium with traces of aluminum and titanium antimony alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. These findings suggested Cooper worked in a chemical or metal manufacturing plant, or an aeronautical engineering company, possibly even Boeing itself, as unalloyed titanium was used in aircraft fabrication facilities at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.

The FBI created multiple sketches of Cooper based on descriptions from passengers and flight crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. The initial sketch from November 28, 1971, was deemed inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. A new sketch was made a year later, also not very accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. The third and final sketch, released on January 2, 1973, was confirmed as accurate by an air hostess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

Larry Carr, who led the investigative team from 2006-2009, believed Cooper was an aircraft cargo loader in the Air Force, as they received basic jump training and understood how to deploy parachutes and aircraft stairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36:00">[20:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>. This led the FBI to compile a list of over 800 potential suspects, with 20 considered seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>.

### Key Suspects

*   **Richard McCoy**: An army veteran who, five months after Cooper's hijacking, hijacked a Boeing 727 in a strikingly similar manner, demanding parachutes and $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>. He was arrested two days later and sentenced to 45 years in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>. A book, "DB Cooper, The Real McCoy," published in 1991 by former FBI agent Russell Caleme, suggested McCoy was Cooper, a belief shared by the FBI at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>. However, the FBI today does not officially consider McCoy as DB Cooper because his description did not match the sketch, and evidence later showed he was in Las Vegas and at home with his family during Cooper's hijacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:00">[22:36:00]</a>.
*   **Robert Rackstraw**: A Vietnam War veteran with a history of fraud, aircraft theft, and explosives possession, though he was often found not guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>. TV producer Thomas Colbert, with a team including former FBI agents, authored "The Last Master Outlaw" (2016) and produced a History Channel documentary, "DB Cooper: Case Closed," arguing Rackstraw was Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:00">[22:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:00">[23:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>. Rackstraw was an initial suspect in the 1970s and made joking comments to the media about being the hijacker, and his face matched the sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. However, the FBI removed him from the suspect list after 1979 due to insufficient evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>. Colbert contended that the FBI should have continued to investigate him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. Coincidentally, the FBI closed the case on July 12, 2016, the day after Colbert launched his book on Rackstraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>. Rackstraw passed away in 2019 due to natural causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.

Despite extensive efforts and the passage of decades, the [[the_mystery_and_unresolved_questions_about_db_cooper | mystery and unresolved questions about DB Cooper]] remains unsolved, with no conclusive answers as to Cooper's true identity, whereabouts, or ultimate fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35:00">[24:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>.

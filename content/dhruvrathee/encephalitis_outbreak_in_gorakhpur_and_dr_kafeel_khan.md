The film "Jawan" depicts a critical scene set in a government hospital where young children die from encephalitis due to a lack of oxygen supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The movie portrays a sincere doctor, Iram, who tries to save the children but is later framed by the government with false accusations and imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This cinematic portrayal is inspired by a real-life incident known as the Gorakhpur tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The Gorakhpur Tragedy (August 2017)

In August 2017, a devastating incident occurred at BRD Medical College, a government hospital in Gorakhpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Within three days, 63 children died because the hospital's piped oxygen supply ran out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Dr. Kafeel Khan's Role and Aftermath

Dr. Kafeel Khan, a pediatrician at the hospital at the time, discovered the dwindling oxygen supply and attempted to inform the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Receiving no response, he took it upon himself to procure oxygen at his own expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He is widely regarded as a real-life hero for his efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

However, when news of the incident reached the media, the blame was shifted onto Dr. Kafeel Khan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The government accused him of medical negligence and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Consequently, he was suspended from his job, arrested, and spent nine months in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In an interview, Dr. Khan recounted being mercilessly beaten and starved for four to five days during his imprisonment, suffering injuries that prevented him from sleeping on his back for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

> "They used to make me naked, they used to beat me with a stick. They didn't give me food and water for 4-5 days!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>

### Legal Proceedings and Inquiry Findings

In April 2018, Dr. Kafeel Khan was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court, which stated there was no evidence of his wrongdoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. A 2017 inquiry panel, set up to investigate the allegations against him, also concluded that the accusations were baseless and inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The panel's report specifically noted that his honest efforts led to the delivery of over 500 jumbo oxygen cylinders to the hospital on August 11th and 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Parallels with "Jawan" and Broader Issues

The film "Jawan" mirrors the real-life situation by showing the doctor resorting to providing Ambu bags to parents when other options ran out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. During the Gorakhpur tragedy, reports confirmed that parents were indeed using Ambu bags in a desperate attempt to save their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, with many witnessing their children's deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Dr. Kafeel Khan described the tragedy as a "man-made" disaster, asserting he was made a scapegoat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Over 30 letters had been sent to the authorities of BRD Medical College and the UP government regarding pending bills of 6.3 million rupees to oxygen suppliers, warning against disruption of supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Just one day before the tragedy, on August 9th, Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Adityanath visited the hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The incident highlighted the dire state of government hospitals in India and their impact on public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. While the film suggests hospitals nationwide could be improved in just five hours with political will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, in reality, it's believed such improvements could realistically take two to three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Health insurance is considered a necessity for individuals and families to secure themselves against uncertainties, especially given the prevalence of various illnesses and diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Experts emphasize that health insurance is "the need of the hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

## Current Landscape in India

India faces significant challenges in its healthcare sector:
*   **Medical Inflation** Medical inflation in India has reached 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   **Out-of-Pocket Expenditure** According to the 2021 Finance Commission Report, 70% of health expenditure is borne out of pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. This leads to approximately 60 million Indians being pushed into poverty each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Low Insurance Coverage** A 2023 report by the National Insurance Academy, unveiled by IRDAI, indicates that 73% of the Indian population is not covered by health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

In response, IRDAI is working towards its vision of "Insurance For All by 2047" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

*   **Financial Security** It ensures financial support when it is most needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

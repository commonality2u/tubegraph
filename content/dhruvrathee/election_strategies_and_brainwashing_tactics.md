Political campaigns often employ various strategies and tactics, including [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | propaganda techniques]] and [[whatsapp_and_media_brainwashing_tactics | brainwashing tactics]], to influence public opinion and secure electoral victories. These methods can range from shaping a leader's public image to controlling information dissemination through media and digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## The Cult of Personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>

A significant tactic in modern politics is the creation of a "cult of personality" around a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This involves emotionally manipulating the public into believing a leader is a messiah or even divine, often despite their failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Fabricated Narratives of Humility and Poverty

Leaders may present exaggerated or false narratives about their humble origins to connect with the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
Narendra Modi's claims include:
*   **"Faqir" (Holy Beggar) Image**: Modi has stated he is a "faqir" and will leave with only the bare minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This contrasts with observations of him wearing expensive sunglasses worth ₹140,000 and traveling in a ₹120 million Mercedes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He also changed outfits multiple times a day during foreign and domestic visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
*   **"Tea Seller" Story**: Modi has claimed he came from an extremely poor family and sold tea in trains during his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This story was also told to Time magazine in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Contradictions**: Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, Modi's biographer, clarified that Modi's claims of poverty are grossly exaggerated and taken out of proportion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Modi's childhood photos show him wearing suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. His younger brother, Prahlad Modi, stated that their father sold tea, making Narendra the "son of a tea seller" rather than a tea seller himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. Additionally, a canteen at Vadnagar railway station, run by Modi's father, was beautified by the Railways Minister, suggesting he was a canteen contractor rather than a simple tea seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Camera Anomaly**: Modi claimed to have used a digital camera in 1987-1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, despite the first commercially available digital camera being released in the US in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### Portrayal of Sacrifice: Abandoning Family for the Nation

A key element in building a leader's image is the narrative of personal sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Abandoning Wife and Family**: Pro-government media and [[the_influence_of_whatsapp_in_political_brainwashing | WhatsApp]] propagate the idea that Narendra Modi abandoned his wife and family for the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Modi himself repeats this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
    *   **Critique**: This narrative is criticized as anti-woman and illogical, contrasting with figures like Lal Bahadur Shastri and Mahatma Jyotirao Phule who contributed greatly while maintaining family lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Unlike Lord Buddha, who sought to thank his wife after enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, Modi reportedly keeps his siblings and extended family at a distance, with family members stating they are "asked to stay away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> and were not invited to his oath ceremony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. This contrasts with his attendance at celebrity and oligarch weddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### Deification and Divine Incarnation

Political figures are sometimes compared to deities to elevate their status and foster blind devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Modi as God**: Numerous politicians have compared Narendra Modi to God, calling him "God's gift to India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, "God incarnate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, and even "Lord Ram" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Temples have been built in his honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Parallels**: This tactic has historical parallels, such as Adolf Hitler being compared to Jesus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Contortion of Religious Figures**: To align a leader's image with religious figures, the characteristics of deities may be contorted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. For instance, the traditional image of Lord Ram has been altered to an "angry Ram" iconography to align with a "hate-filled agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. False quotes like "Violence is the foremost duty" have been inserted into Hindu scriptures and circulated via [[whatsapp_and_media_brainwashing_tactics | WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Brainwashing and Emotional Manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>

The process of [[the_influence_of_whatsapp_in_political_brainwashing | brainwashing]] on a large scale involves four key departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>:
1.  **Pride and Arrogance**: Instilling a sense of superiority (e.g., "You are great because you are a Hindu") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Victimization**: Highlighting perceived historical victimhood (e.g., "Your ancestors were victims for thousands of years") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
3.  **Fear**: Creating a sense of danger and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
4.  **Messiah Portrayal**: Presenting the leader as the sole savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Discrediting Opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>

A common [[propaganda_techniques_in_media | propaganda technique]] is to portray opponents as incompetent fools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **"Pappu" Narrative**: Rahul Gandhi is often portrayed as an "incompetent Pappu" through out-of-context and edited clips circulated by IT cells, especially on [[the_influence_of_whatsapp_in_political_brainwashing | WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Suppression of Debate**: While Rahul Gandhi has given lectures at various universities and engaged in unscripted interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, PM Modi has not held a single press conference or unscripted interview in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. A challenge for a one-on-one debate between Modi and Gandhi was accepted by Gandhi but not by Modi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## Media Control and Visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>

The principle of "out of sight is out of mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> is applied by ensuring the leader's constant visibility.
*   **Ubiquitous Image**: Narendra Modi's face is omnipresent on newspapers, radio, TV channels, social media, petrol pump hoardings, and government scheme advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. His image even appeared on Covid vaccine certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Advertising Expenditure**: The government reportedly spent over ₹64.91 billion on advertisements in 8 years, including ₹7.1 million daily for newspaper ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This massive spending contributes to the [[role_of_media_and_misinformation_in_shaping_public_opinion | shaping of public opinion]].
*   **Pro-Government Media**: News anchors who support the government also contribute to this constant positive portrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Hiding Poverty**: During events like the Namaste Trump event in Gujarat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a> and the G20 summit in Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, walls or green screens were built to hide slums and restrict the movement of poor people, showing a deliberate effort to control public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Impact and Consequences

*   **Blind Devotion**: These tactics can lead to extreme devotion, where supporters express unwavering loyalty despite personal hardships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. For example, a BJP worker, Mangal Vajpayee, despite lacking basic amenities like electricity and sewage, still expressed no complaints and called himself a devotee of BJP, believing Modi to be God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Others have stated they would vote for "a dog" if it ran on a BJP ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Income Inequality**: Despite claims of working for the poor, the past decade has seen increased wealth for a select few, such as Gautam Adani, while 800 million people remain dependent on free grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Income inequality in India is reported to be the highest in 100 years, worse than during British rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Concrete Plans**: The government is criticized for not presenting clear plans for employment, inflation control, or poverty eradication, instead extending free ration schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Dehumanization of the Poor**: Hiding poor populations behind screens or walls for foreign dignitaries is seen as dehumanizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Manipulation of Religion**: The manipulation of religious texts and figures for a "hate-filled agenda" can alienate religious communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Recruitment of Corrupt Politicians**: The need for the BJP to recruit politicians accused of large-scale corruption from other parties suggests that the "Modi magic" alone is no longer sufficient to win elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This highlights issues related to [[media_bias_and_misinformation_in_indian_politics | media bias and misinformation in Indian politics]] and the ongoing [[electoral_bond_scam | Electoral Bond Scam]].

### Call to Action
There is an emphasis on combating misinformation and protecting democracy, urging people to share information, vote, and encourage others to vote against "hate and lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

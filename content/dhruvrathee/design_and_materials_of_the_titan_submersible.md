The Titan submersible, operated by OceanGate, was a unique vessel designed for deep-sea expeditions, particularly to the [[titan_submersible_mission_to_titanic_wreck | wreck of the Titanic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This form of adventure tourism was extremely expensive, with each passenger spending over ₹20 million for a few hours of the tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The high cost was due to the immense depth of the Titanic wreck, located 3,810 meters (12,500 feet) below the surface of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Submersible vs. Submarine

It is important to distinguish between a submarine and a submersible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. While similar, submarines possess their own power and can independently enter and exit the sea from a port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Submersibles, like the Titan, require a support ship on the surface, such as the Polar Prince, to launch them into the water and recover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## OceanGate and its Expeditions

The entire operation was managed by OceanGate, a private company founded in 2009 by aerospace engineer Stockton Rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The company's objective was to offer deep-sea expeditions as tourism for affluent individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. OceanGate began offering [[titan_submersible_mission_to_titanic_wreck | Titanic tours]] in July 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In addition to the Titan, OceanGate owned two other submersibles: Antipodes, capable of reaching 304 meters, and Cyclops, capable of 500 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, the Titan was uniquely designed to descend to 4,000 meters, making it the sole submersible suitable for visits to the [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] wreck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Design Specifications

The Titan was engineered to withstand the extreme pressures of the deep ocean, where the pressure at 12,500 feet (the [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]]'s depth) is nearly 400 times the surface pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

*   **Capacity and Size**: The Titan could accommodate five people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Its total length was approximately 6.7 meters, and it weighed over 10,400 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Hull Materials**: The main body, or Hull, was constructed from carbon fiber, an experimental design choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Two titanium caps were attached at each end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Typically, submarines and submersibles are made from steel, titanium, or aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Thrusters**: The submersible featured four electric thrusters on the exterior—two horizontal and two vertical—for operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Viewport**: The Titan's viewport was notably the largest installed in any private submersible to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Control and Internal Features

*   **Control System**: The Titan was uniquely controlled using a video game controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. While the US Navy also uses Xbox controllers for some submarine functions, the entire Titan was operated this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Interior Layout**: There were no seats inside the submersible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. A small, unpartitioned toilet was located beside the viewport, requiring other passengers to turn away when in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Due to GPS inoperability at deep-sea depths, communication with the support ship relied on a text messaging system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. OceanGate had previously stated they used Starlink's satellite internet service for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Entry/Exit**: The submersible's hatch could only be locked and opened from the outside, meaning those inside were unable to exit independently, even if on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Safety Concerns and Failure

The Titan's experimental carbon fiber design was a significant point of contention. No one had previously tested carbon fiber's properties at such extreme ocean depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This choice was later deemed unsuitable for this application by ocean explorer Robert Ballard, who discovered the [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] wreck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

Stockton Rush, OceanGate's CEO, expressed views prioritizing innovation over strict safety regulations. He criticized the US Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 for "needlessly prioritizing passenger safety over commercial innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. In an interview, he stated:

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> "At some point, safety just is pure waste. I mean, if you just want to be safe, don't get out of bed, don't get in your car, don't do anything."
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> "I've broken some rules to make Titan. I think I've broken them with logic and good engineering behind me."

He intentionally disregarded rules regarding the use of carbon fiber and titanium in the submersible's construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

Warnings about the Titan's safety and design issues were raised by industry professionals. In January 2018, David Lochridge, OceanGate's Director of Marine Operations, voiced safety concerns and sought a safety assessment and certification for the submersible, which OceanGate refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. He claimed the company was unwilling to invest in safety measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Additionally, in March 2018, 36 industry leaders, deep-sea explorers, and oceanographers collectively wrote to Stockton Rush, warning that his experimental approach and lack of quality checks could lead to a severe accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Another specialist emailed Rush, advising more conservative safety practices and cautioning that Rush was endangering himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

The incident drew parallels to the [[safety_measures_and_failures_on_the_Titanic | RMS Titanic]]'s "unsinkable" claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Just as the [[history_and_construction_details_of_the_rms_titanic | Titanic]] tragically sank despite such beliefs, the Titan met a similar fate due to design flaws and disregard for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

The eventual "catastrophic implosion" of the Titan, caused by the immense deep-sea pressure, confirmed the structural failure of its carbon fiber hull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The titanium caps remained intact, while the carbon fiber body was shattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. This tragedy highlighted the critical importance of adhering to safety standards and regulations in engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

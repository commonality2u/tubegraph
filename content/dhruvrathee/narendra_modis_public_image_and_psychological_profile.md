From: [[dhruvrathee]] <br/> 

In 1996, psychologist Ashis Nandy interviewed [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]] for several hours. Nandy was profoundly affected by the interview, leading him to assess [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]]'s mentality, which he later characterized in stark terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Public Image: Real vs. Fabricated

The public image of [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]] is often presented through media and WhatsApp, creating a "fake image" for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. His true personality and mentality, however, are described as potentially shocking to his supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Inconsistent Stances

[[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]] has displayed inconsistent stances on issues, particularly regarding religious communities:
*   **Communal vs. Secular Branding**: After the 2002 riots, he was branded as 'Communal [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]]', an unwavering Hindu opposed to Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, he has also been viewed as a secular man focused on development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Contradictory Actions**:
    *   While making speeches about avoiding mutton and fish during Sawaan, his party accepts donations from Halal Beef Exporting Companies via electoral bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   He has praised Islam and Prophet Muhammad, stating that Allah's 99 names do not advocate violence and that Islam's message is peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. He has also affirmed that all minorities are an integral part of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   He has claimed that his family celebrated Eid and received food from Muslim neighbors, and that during Moharram processions, they would pass under the Tajiya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   Despite his communal speeches, he has sometimes presented himself as a peace messenger, promising not to divide the country on religious lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. In a 2014 tweet, he declared "Secularism is in our blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
    *   He has stated that if he ever used Hindu-Muslim rhetoric for politics, he would cease to be fit for public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Strategic Adaptability**: He adjusts his rhetoric based on the region or political necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For instance, in Rajasthan, he spoke against "intruders" who "have more kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, but in Bihar, he became a "peace messenger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    *   In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP emotionally manipulates people with the holy cow narrative to stop cow slaughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, while in Kerala, they promise quality beef for votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. In Goa (2015), Amit Shah explicitly stated there were no plans to ban beef in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### 'Connections' and False Claims

*   **Kolkata Metro**: Claimed to have visited as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, despite the metro beginning operation in 1984 when he was 34 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Rebirth in Bengal**: Stated he wished to be reborn in Bengal to appear relatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Abandoned Slogans and Unfulfilled Promises

*   Demonetisation, once hailed as a "surgical strike against black money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, is no longer used for political campaigning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   The three farm laws, initially termed a "historic achievement" for farmers, were repealed, and neither the laws nor their repeal are used for votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   Promises of doubling farmers' income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> and "neither be corrupt nor allow others to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> are not frequently mentioned anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   Campaigns like Make in India, Made in India, Adarsh Gaon, Smart City, Bullet Train, Skill India, Mudra Loan, Look East Policy, and promises of millions of jobs are no longer prominently featured on election posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Avoidance of Scrutiny
[[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]] has not held a single press conference or unscripted interview in 10 years, avoiding questions from journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. He avoids open debates, such as the one challenged by Rahul Gandhi, instead relying on Hindu-Muslim narratives and "connections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Influencers known for "filthy language" are invited to his home and followed on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

### Self-Obsession and Cult of Personality
[[narendra_modis_image_and_cult_of_personality|Narendra Modi's image and cult of personality]] is evident in several actions:
*   **Personalization of Achievements**: Olympic medalists' posters feature [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]]'s photo prominently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Renaming Landmarks**: The Sardar Patel stadium was renamed after [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]], with its ends named after Ambani and Adani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   **Exclusive Presence**: During the Ram Mandir inauguration, only [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]] was prominently featured, unlike the Akshardham temple inauguration which included various dignitaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **Photographic Opportunism**: He has been observed moving people out of camera view for his photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **Self-Promotion**: His photo is printed on free food bags and COVID vaccine certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Government schemes, roads, and hospitals are named after him (e.g., Namo Kisan Samman Diwas, Narendra Modi Medical College) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.
*   **Staged PR**: Photoshoots with ducks, feeding peacocks, morning exercise routines, beach and gym photoshoots, and wild safari photoshoots illustrate his self-obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Desire for Worship and Psychological Dominance
Political strategist Prashant Kishore states that the BJP wants more than just votes; they seek "full control of your mind" and ideological and psychological dominance, expecting worship and adherence to their dictates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

### Authoritarian Political Policy
[[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]]'s approach combines economic policies favoring "rich friends and loyalists" with social policies like "divide and rule" to manage dissent from the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. For those who still oppose, the political policy is authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

*   **Labeling Critics as Traitors**: This is described as a "formula of D!ctatorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Critics, from singers to journalists, face vile insults, threats, and physical attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   **Suppression of Criticism**: The goal is to make [[narendra_modis_political_journey_and_roles|Narendra Modi]] and his allies (like Brij Bhushan Singh and Ajay Mishra Teni) "beyond people's criticism," expecting people to "endure everything quietly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

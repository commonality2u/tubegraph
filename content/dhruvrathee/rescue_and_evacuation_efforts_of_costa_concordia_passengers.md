On January 13, 2012, at 7:15 PM, the **Costa Concordia**, one of the world's largest Italian cruise ships, set sail for a 7-day European tour with 4,252 people on board, including passengers and crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Just 2.5 hours after departure, at 9:45 PM, a sudden piercing noise was heard, followed by a blackout and the ship began tilting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This marked the beginning of a chaotic and delayed [[search_and_rescue_operations | rescue and evacuation]] effort.

## Initial Misinformation and Delay
Despite the severity of the incident, passengers were initially informed via intercom that there was only an electrical failure on the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The ship's engine had failed, but the captain, [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Francesco Schettino]], concealed this fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Passengers began to realize the true danger as the ship tilted further, fearing another incident similar to the [[investigations_and_legacy_of_the_titanic_disaster | Titanic's]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The collision with rocks, which tore a 70-meter-long wound in the hull, happened at 9:45 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Water rapidly flowed into the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Despite the chief engineer informing Captain Schettino of the dire situation by 9:52 PM, Schettino announced to passengers that it was merely a "simple blackout" and "nothing to worry about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

At around 10:00 PM, Schettino made the decision to turn the ship towards [[role_and_actions_of_captain_francesco_schettino | Giglio Island]], believing it would be safer to sink near land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This U-turn caused the ship to tilt to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It wasn't until 10:22 PM—over 30 minutes after the collision and only after repeated calls from the Italian Coast Guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>—that Captain Schettino finally informed the Coast Guard of the collision and requested tugboats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

A general emergency alarm was not raised until 10:33 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, and the order to abandon ship was given by Captain Schettino at 10:59 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>—more than an hour after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Passenger and Crew Initiatives Amidst Chaos
Prior to the captain's official announcement, some passengers had already fled using lifeboats, while others jumped into the water and swam towards Giglio Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Dissatisfied with Captain Schettino's behavior, some crew members rebelled and began evacuating passengers into lifeboats 10 to 15 minutes before the official order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Challenges During Evacuation
The evacuation was hampered by several factors:
*   **Ship Tilt**: As the ship tilted by 30 degrees, then 40, and 50 degrees, lower cabins submerged, and items were strewn across upper decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Finding exits became incredibly difficult for those on the non-submerged side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Language Barriers**: Many crew members did not speak Italian, the primary language of most passengers, hindering clear communication during the emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Lack of Training**: Most crew members were service staff, not trained for emergency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Heroic Actions of Crew and Civilians
Despite the challenges, many crew members and civilians displayed immense bravery:
*   **Karnaatha Rameshana**: The only woman in Concordia's 11-member security staff, she personally seated a blind woman on a lifeboat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Russell Rebello**: An Indian waiter, he continuously helped passengers onto lifeboats until the very end, tragically drowning while assisting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. He reportedly gave up his own life jacket to save a passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Mario Pellegrini**: The deputy mayor of Giglio Island, a civilian, bravely went to the sinking ship, jumping into a lifeboat to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. He used ropes to [[rescue_and_problemsolving_strategies_in_apollo_13 | rescue]] people trapped in "wells" of water inside the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Roberto Bosio**: Another ship's captain who was on board the Concordia as a passenger, he did not flee the ship and continued to help people until the end, starting the evacuation even before Schettino's official announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

## Official [[search_and_rescue_operations | Rescue Operations]]
Around 2,500 to 3,300 people safely reached Giglio Island in the early stages of the evacuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. By 11:38 PM, approximately 400 people were still trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The Italian Coast Guard helicopters and fire and [[rescue_efforts_and_the_sinking_aftermath | rescue]] services boats arrived, saving hundreds from underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

At 12:42 AM, Coast Guard Commander Captain Gregorio De Falco famously called Captain Schettino, ordering him to return to the ship and coordinate the [[rescue_efforts_and_the_sinking_aftermath | rescue]] effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Schettino refused, leading to him being called "Captain Coward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

The official [[search_and_rescue_operations | rescue operation]] continued for 2 to 2.5 weeks, involving the Italian Navy, Coast Guard, and Fire and Rescue Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. [[search_and_rescue_operations | Rescue]] divers were crucial, as water pressure prevented people from opening cabin doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. On January 14, a South Korean couple was rescued after being trapped in their cabin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

## Post-Evacuation Support on Giglio Island
The 700 residents of Giglio Island opened their homes, schools, churches, and canteens to provide shelter, blankets, and dry clothes to the more than 4,000 survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Many survivors suffered from hypothermia, and all were desperate to locate family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## Casualties and the Impact of Delay
A total of 32 people died in the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Most fatalities occurred because people were trapped and drowned in their cabins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Had passengers been informed promptly, more lives could have been saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

Captain Schettino, in contrast to the heroic actions of others, abandoned the ship at 11:19 PM, being among the first crew members to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. He later falsely claimed he fell into a lifeboat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. In 2017, he was sentenced to 16 years in jail for manslaughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. The total cost of the disaster for the operating company, Costa Crociere, a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation, reached $2 billion, including compensation for passengers and families of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

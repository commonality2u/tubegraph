In recent times, there has been a significant shift in the landscape of news channels compared to the Congress government and the Vajpayee government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The notion that "the truth is being revealed" is contrasted with "the walls of lie" growing daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Decline of Indian Media Credibility

The credibility of Indian media has seen a notable decline over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Around 2007, media persons in India were highly respected, but this has since changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. India's World Press Freedom ranking is 138 out of 180 countries, significantly lower than developed countries which are typically in the top 20-30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Foreign audiences often find Indian news channels more akin to comedy entertainment shows due to the argumentative and fact-deficient nature of debates, especially on religious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Mainstream media has been observed to have outsourced its duties and responsibilities to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This means individuals now have to personally risk themselves to expose the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Influence and Misinformation

### Circulation of Fake News and Misinformation
Many political parties have mastered the technique of faking news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. In India, media often approves statements without verifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Fake messages related to religion, country, caste, planning, and history are widely circulated via [[the_influence_of_whatsapp_in_political_brainwashing | WhatsApp]], often leading people to believe them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This has contributed to an "empire of lies" that has altered the views of readers and viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Media Bias and Agenda Setting
Indian media often prioritizes certain narratives. For example, a news channel might highlight a vague statement by Rahul Gandhi over a significant development like the Finance Bill legalizing corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. In such cases, the names of political donors may not be revealed, sometimes even framed as an example of transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

During demonetization, some Hindi newspapers printed statements from Jaitley and Rahul Gandhi side-by-side, leaving it to the public to decide the truth, rather than the media fulfilling its responsibility to find and question the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Suppression and Censorship
Exposing powerful politicians who are surrounded by "untrue words" can be a self-sacrificing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Media channels tend to suppress individuals who speak against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Attempts at censorship include using copyright claims to shut down channels or prevent the public use of video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. A law was even passed that prevents criticism of the Prime Minister and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Troll armies are used to abuse and censor individuals through comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

## Role of Independent Journalists and YouTubers

Given the state of mainstream media, individuals like Dhruv Rathee, a YouTuber with a large following, have taken on the role of exposing fake news and scams from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. He started creating videos in 2016 out of frustration with the fake news and photoshopped images circulating in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Independent platforms often face challenges:
*   **Lack of Support**: Media outlets generally do not support those who speak against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Personal Risk**: Exposing truth requires personal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Dhruv Rathee keeps his location confidential due to threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Crowd Funding**: Dhruv Rathee relies on crowd donations, with around 500 supporters, mostly Indians and NRIs, funding his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

Despite these challenges, there is a perceived impact, with many viewers reporting that Dhruv Rathee's videos have changed their views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. He views himself primarily as a YouTuber and an artist who loves making journalism-related videos, rather than a qualified journalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Comparison with International Media
In contrast to India, media in other countries, like the Washington Post in America, track the promises made by politicians such as President Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The Washington Post published an article on November 2nd, 2018, stating that Trump made 6,420 false promises in 649 days of his tenure, averaging five lies a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. India could also maintain such records, but many mainstream media outlets are associated with political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Foreign media channels generally have calm discussions, focus on facts, and avoid unnecessary arguments, especially on religious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They are very aware of their work and understand the responsibility of the government, media, and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

## Societal Impact
The [[influence_of_media_on_social_behavior_and_norms | influence of media on social behavior and norms]] is evident in the polarization seen globally. Social media creates "bubbles" where individuals are shown content aligning with their existing views, further reinforcing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. In India, mainstream media contributes to this division, while abroad, social media plays a similar role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

There is a growing interest in history after 2014, with less concern for present issues, and some people demand content on past scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. The public and media need to understand what topics are truly important for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

Ultimately, it is the viewers' responsibility to look at both sides of a story and evaluate the facts presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

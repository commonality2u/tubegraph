The identity of the woman depicted in the iconic Mona Lisa painting has long been a subject of fascination and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. While various [[theories_and_debates_surrounding_the_mona_lisa | theories]] have emerged over time, strong evidence now points to a specific individual.

## Initial Revelation and Naming

The first significant revelation regarding the woman's identity came from Italian artist Giorgio Vasari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. In 1550, Vasari wrote an autobiography of [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Leonardo da Vinci]], stating that the woman was Lisa Gherardini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. She was married to Francesco Giocondo, a silk trader residing in Florence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Vasari believed Francesco had commissioned the portrait of his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

This account is the origin of the painting's two most famous names:

*   **Mona Lisa:** Derived from "Madonna Lisa," where "Madonna" traditionally meant "Madam" in Italian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. "Madonna" was later shortened to "Monna" (double N) and then "Mona" (single N) in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Thus, "Mona Lisa" signifies "Madam Lisa" or "Lady Lisa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **La Gioconda:** After her marriage, Lisa Gherardini became Lisa Giocondo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Interestingly, the Italian word "Giocondo" translates to "light-hearted" or "cheerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, which aligns with the painting's famous smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. In French, it is written as "La Joconde" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Debated Identities and Confirmed Evidence

Despite Vasari's account, people in 1550 were skeptical, and many [[theories_and_debates_surrounding_the_mona_lisa | theories]] emerged suggesting the woman was someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Some speculated she was [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Leonardo da Vinci]]'s mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> or an Italian queen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The most intriguing theory proposed that the painting was a self-portrait of Da Vinci, imagining himself as a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. This idea was promoted by artist Lilian Schwartz in 1987, who used digital tools to highlight similarities between Da Vinci's face and the Mona Lisa's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

However, modern research has largely confirmed the identity of Lisa Giocondo. A professor in Florence conducted 25 years of research, examining archives, and in 2004, discovered clear evidence to prove this fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Lisa Giocondo's Background

The research confirmed several details about Lisa Giocondo:

*   **Family Connections:** The Da Vinci family had a close relationship with Francesco Giocondo's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Leonardo da Vinci]]'s father and Lisa's husband knew each other well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Marriage Details:** Lisa's marriage was registered on March 5, 1495 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. At the time, Lisa was 16 years old, and Francesco was approximately 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   **Age at Painting:** When the Mona Lisa was painted, Lisa was 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Commissioning Reasons:** It is believed that the painting was commissioned for one of two reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>:
    *   The purchase of Francesco and Lisa's new home in 1503 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
    *   The birth of their second son in December 1502 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. The latter seems more probable because Lisa had lost a daughter three years prior, in 1499 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Mourning Veil:** A veil over Lisa's hair in the painting is often interpreted as a mourning veil, worn when a family member has passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

### The "Two Mona Lisas" Theory

The "two Mona Lisas" theory further informs our understanding of Lisa's appearance in the painting. When a second Mona Lisa painting, known as the Isleworth Mona Lisa, was revealed in 1914, it showed a notably younger version of the woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. This led experts to theorize that [[the_artistic_techniques_of_leonardo_da_vinci_used_in_the_mona_lisa | Leonardo da Vinci]] may have worked on two versions of the portrait, with the Isleworth version being an earlier work where he experimented with his style, hence the younger depiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

Despite the ongoing [[theories_and_debates_surrounding_the_mona_lisa | debates]] surrounding details, the overwhelming evidence confirms that the world-famous Mona Lisa depicts Lisa Gherardini, also known as Lisa Giocondo.

On February 1, 2003, [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA's Columbia Space Shuttle]] was returning to Earth after a two-week mission in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Seven astronauts were aboard, including Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While their families awaited their return with anticipation, for NASA, it was considered a routine flight, being the 28th flight of the Space Mission Columbia program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, this mission ended in tragedy, becoming known as the [[investigation_and_lessons_from_the_columbia_disaster | Columbia disaster]].

## The Final Flight: STS-107

At 8:44 AM, the space shuttle re-entered Earth's atmosphere, with systems initially appearing normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) Charlie Hobaugh was communicating with the shuttle from the Space Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A few minutes later, Hobaugh discussed tire pressure readings with Mission Commander Rick Husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Suddenly, the line cut out, with only the word "Roger" being heard from Husband before communication was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Despite repeated attempts, no further contact could be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Unbeknownst to the [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] team on the ground, an explosion had occurred in the Columbia Space Shuttle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Soon after, calls to the Kennedy Space Center urged staff to watch the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Eyewitnesses observed the shuttle break apart in the sky over Texas at 9:12 AM, appearing like a blazing comet that shattered into multiple pieces falling to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Within hours, [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] realized the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. President George Bush addressed the nation, confirming that the Columbia was lost with no survivors, and all seven astronauts were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Among them was 40-year-old Indian-born American Kalpana Chawla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Kalpana Chawla: A Journey to Space

Kalpana Chawla was born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, Haryana, India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Her parents, Banarasilal and Sanjyoti Chawla, had immigrated from Pakistan during the partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. She was their youngest child and chose her own name, "Kalpana," meaning imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

From a young age, Kalpana was interested in space, inspired by planes flying in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Despite advice from her father and professors against pursuing a career path deemed unsuitable for girls, she remained determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, followed by a Master's degree from the University of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. In 1988, she completed her PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

At 26, Kalpana Chawla began working at [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA's]] Ames Research Center, specializing in Fluid Dynamics Aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. She held several pilot licenses for airplanes, gliders, and seaplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. After becoming an American citizen in 1991, she was selected by [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] for astronaut training in 1994, from a pool of 4,000 applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### First Space Flight: STS-87

In November 1997, after three years of training, Kalpana Chawla embarked on her first space flight aboard the [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | Columbia program]] flight STS-87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. As a Mission Specialist, she was the primary operator of the robotic arm, responsible for deploying the Spartan satellite, which was meant to study the sun's outer layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. During this mission, the satellite went out of control, and she was initially unable to retrieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. However, after three days and a spacewalk, the satellite was recovered, and [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] scientists later praised her efforts, confirming it was not her fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

This successful mission made Kalpana Chawla the first Indian-origin woman and the first South Asian-American woman to go to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The then Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral congratulated her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Kalpana described her experience of looking at the stars and galaxy, feeling a connection not just to a piece of land, but to the Earth and the solar system as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The 16-day flight also involved scientific experiments, such as observing plant reproduction in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Second Space Flight: STS-107

Kalpana Chawla's second and final flight, Mission STS-107, was launched on January 16, 2003, after being delayed 13 times since its original planning in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The crew of seven astronauts, led by Commander Rick Husband, included Kalpana Chawla as a Mission Specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Their mission involved conducting non-stop experiments for 24 hours (in shifts) for 16 days in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Around 80 experiments focused on life sciences, material science, and fluid physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Kalpana Chawla's focus was on microgravity, including combustion in space, fire suppression, crystal growth, and prostate cancer growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Experiments on cells in space showed they grow in three dimensions, similar to cancer tumors in the body, providing insight into tumor behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

Spacehab collaborated with [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] for this mission, allowing universities, companies, and government agencies worldwide to conduct research in space through the astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Children from six schools across different countries also had their experiments conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. These experiments included observing spiders, silkworms, fish, bees, and ants in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. An interesting discovery was that the smell of flowers changes in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. About 30% of the experiment data was transmitted to Earth and saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

Notably, a live group of roundworms in aluminum canisters survived the [[investigation_and_lessons_from_the_columbia_disaster | disaster]] with minor heat damage, and their descendants were later sent on the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## The Space Shuttle Program (STS)

The STS, or Space Transportation System, was the official name of [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA's space shuttle program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. It was the fourth program to include human space flights, following Project Mercury, Project Gemini, and the [[challenges_and_incidents_during_apollo_13 | Apollo program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Starting in 1981, it became the longest human space flight program in history, running until 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. A key focus of the program was reusability, aiming to launch the same space shuttles repeatedly to avoid building new ones for each mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

The program primarily used two main space shuttles: Challenger and Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. After the [[investigation_and_lessons_from_the_columbia_disaster | Columbia disaster]], Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour shuttles were also utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Columbia was the first space shuttle to launch in April 1981, completing 27 successful missions before the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The STS program was specifically designed for reusability, with extensive inspection, repair, and refurbishment processes after each flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Cause of the Disaster

The [[investigation_and_lessons_from_the_columbia_disaster | Columbia disaster]] was not due to pilot error, crew mistakes, or the inherent reusability of the shuttle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. The astronauts had no idea of the impending accident until minutes before it occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. At 8:58 AM, the backup flight software displayed messages indicating four wheels on the left side of the shuttle had lost pressure, a minute before contact was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

The actual cause was a "minor reason" that originated 16 days before the accident, during the shuttle's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
After 81 seconds of Columbia's launch, a small piece of foam, approximately 60 cm long and 40 cm wide, weighing only 750 grams, separated from the external tank and struck the left wing at an estimated speed of 700-900 km per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

Several days after this incident, some [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] engineers requested images from American spy satellites to assess the damage to the shuttle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. However, this request was refused by the Chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Ron D. Dittemore, the STS Program Manager, later resigned in April 2003, acknowledging his mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. A book by space journalists Michael Cabbage and William Hardwood, *Comm Check* (2008), confirmed that the Department of Defense was prepared to use its spy cameras, but officials declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### Investigation Findings

An internal commission, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), was formed to investigate the [[investigation_and_lessons_from_the_columbia_disaster | disaster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Its thorough report, released in August 2003, detailed the causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. The report highlighted [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA's]] negligence, specifically William Readdy's (human spaceflight chief) failure to accept the offer of spy satellites to monitor the damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. As a result, the damage was not investigated, and the mission proceeded for 15 more days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

When the shuttle re-entered Earth's atmosphere, the damage on the left wing, which was a small hole, expanded due to the extreme conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Air began to leak, compromising the thermal protection system that maintained the shuttle's internal temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. As the hole grew larger, a suitcase-sized piece of insulation broke off, exposing a significant portion of Columbia to external fire and gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This caused the left wing's sensors to fail, followed by tire pressure readings disappearing, leading to the spacecraft breaking apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The incident, caused by a small piece of foam, resulted in seven fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

The CAIB report also noted that such foam strikes were common, having been observed in 65 out of 79 prior missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The critical issue was that this specific piece of foam hit "the wrong place at the wrong time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

A December 2008 report, the *Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report*, indicated that the astronauts died within seconds due to cabin pressure disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. They did not suffer from heat or damage during the violent disintegration of the shuttle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. The report stated that even with better cabin equipment, the astronauts could not have been saved, as "the crew's subsequent exposure to hypersonic entry conditions was not survivable by any currently existing capability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

Following the [[investigation_and_lessons_from_the_columbia_disaster | Columbia disaster]], [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] paused its space shuttle program for two and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Crucially, the design of the foam ramp was changed to prevent similar incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. The space shuttle program continued until the International Space Station became fully functional, finally wrapping up in July 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Over its 30-year run, the program conducted 135 missions, with 14 astronauts losing their lives in unfortunate accidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

Kalpana Chawla's impact on millions of lives remains significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Her passion for science education led her to arrange for students from her secondary school in Karnal, Tagore Bal Niketan Senior Secondary School, to participate in [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA's]] Summer Space Experience Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Since 1998, two girls from her school annually attended the Foundation for International Space Education's United Space School in Houston, where Kalpana Chawla would invite them to her home for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

[[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA]] paid tribute to Kalpana Chawla and the other crew members. The landing site of [[nasa_space_shuttle_program | NASA's]] Mars rover was named Columbia Memorial Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. Additionally, asteroids between Mars and Jupiter were named after the crew members, including asteroid 51826 Kalpana Chawla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

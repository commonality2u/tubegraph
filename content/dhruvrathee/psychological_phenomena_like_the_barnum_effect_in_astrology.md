Despite a lack of scientific basis, millions continue to believe in astrology. This widespread belief can often be attributed to several psychological phenomena and techniques employed by astrologers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## The Desire for Certainty
One primary reason for belief in astrology stems from the inherent uncertainty of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. People crave certainty, security, and a guaranteed good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Astrological predictions, especially positive ones, offer a sense of security and happiness, which can be particularly appealing to individuals with "weak minds" who are disinclined to question or doubt the astrologer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Swami Vivekananda reportedly noted that such beliefs are a sign of a weak mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Cold Reading
Astrologers frequently use a technique known as [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | cold reading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This involves making generalized statements that appear specific to an individual, allowing the person to interpret them in a way that resonates with their own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

For example, a statement like "Your fate will take a turn for the better when you turn 30" is broad enough to encompass various positive life changes such as a new job, marriage, or the birth of a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Similarly, stating that "An incident happened in your childhood that has left a lasting impact on your life" is universally applicable, as everyone has significant childhood experiences, be it the loss of a pet, a family member, or instances of bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. When confronted with such statements, individuals often feel the astrologer is remarkably accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

## The Barnum Effect (Forer Effect)
Another significant psychological phenomenon at play is the Barnum Effect, also known as the Forer Effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### Forer's Experiment
In 1948, psychologist Bertram R. Forer conducted a famous experiment to demonstrate this effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. He gave a personality test to 39 students, promising a unique personality sketch based on their answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. A week later, each student received a paper with 13 qualities, and they were asked to rate how accurately these qualities described their personality on a scale of 0 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

The surprising result was that 34 out of 39 students rated the accuracy at 4 or higher, with an average accuracy of 4.26 out of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The twist, however, was that **all students had received the exact same personality sketch** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Despite this, they believed the description was uniquely tailored to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

### Why the Barnum Effect Works
Forer concluded that people tend to believe generalized descriptions are specifically about them, especially if the descriptions are presented as individualistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. This happens for two main reasons:
1.  **Desire for Positive/Sympathetic Information**: People prefer to hear positive or sympathetic things about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
2.  **Belief in Uniqueness**: Individuals like to think of themselves as special and unique, even though, in reality, people are not as unique as they perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

Astrologers exploit this by providing vague yet flattering statements that appear to describe profound insights into a person's character. For instance:
*   "You have so much capacity you have not tapped into yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   "You need some variety in your life, that's why you do not like anyone restricting you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   "You've seen that revealing everything about yourself to someone is not good. Often you doubt whether you made the right decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   "You are very kind-hearted. Always adjusting for other people's sake, because the thing that matters most to you is the love and respect of the people. But as a consequence, people take advantage of you. They think of you as an emotional fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

These statements, while universally applicable to many, make individuals feel deeply understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

## Picking Up Clues
Astrologers also use sharp observation skills, similar to mentalists, to gather information about their clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. They pay attention to details such as:
*   **Dressing style**: Formal, casual, type of t-shirt, designer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   **Physical appearance**: Weight gain or fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
*   **Language and demeanor**: Use of plain Hindi, regional languages, English words, confidence, or vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

These observations allow them to make accurate guesses about a person's diet, hobbies, job, economic status, and education level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Felicity Carter, a former astrologer who later exposed her methods, revealed that she often heard the same stories about problems in romance, work, or the desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. With experience, she could often deduce a client's problem from their appearance alone, leading to seemingly miraculous insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

## Outright Fraud
In some cases, astrologers resort to outright [[techniques_used_by_astrologers_to_deceive_people | fraud]], obtaining personal information through secret channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Shyam Manav, founder of the Akhil Bharatiya Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (an organization that debunks superstitions), demonstrated this trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. He recounted an instance where a rickshaw driver subtly extracted information from him on the way to an astrologer's office. Later, the astrologer dramatically revealed this information, falsely claiming it was obtained through psychic means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

> These techniques and psychological phenomena are commonly used by astrologers worldwide to deceive people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Understanding them helps in recognizing that one's future is largely within their own control, despite external circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

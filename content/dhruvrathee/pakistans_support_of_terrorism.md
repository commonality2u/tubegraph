Pakistan's history of supporting and sponsoring terrorism on its soil makes it difficult to trust its army and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Despite agreements, Pakistan has consistently violated ceasefires and international protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## Ceasefire Violations and Retaliation
An [[indiapakistan_ceasefire_and_violations | India-Pakistan ceasefire]] was agreed upon for the evening of May 10th, 2024, starting at 5:00 pm, halting all military action from land, air, and sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This agreement was publicly announced by Donald Trump on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. However, just hours later, Pakistan initiated ceasefire violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

In response to the [[pahalgam_terrorist_attack_details | Pahalgam terrorist attack]], for which Pakistan's terror group TRF (a shadow group of Lashkar-e-Taiba) took responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, India launched Operation Sindoor. This operation targeted nine specific terrorist sites in Pakistan, chosen based on credible intelligence to avoid civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

In retaliation for Operation Sindoor, Islamabad attacked civilian villages along the Line of Control, demonstrating that the Pakistan government and military support terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Pakistan carried out unprovoked firing on the LoC and bombarded Indian civilian houses with mortars and shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. In the border town of Pooch, at least 16 people were killed and 59 injured, of whom 44 were civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This included the deaths of 14-year-old and 12-year-old children from a single family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Evidence of State Sponsorship of Terrorism
India's Operation Sindoor targeted well-known terror sites that are listed by both Indian authorities and the international intelligence community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>:
*   **Markaz Taiba, Muridke:** Headquarters of Hafiz Saeed (designated terrorist by UN in 2008, US bounty in 2012) and the nerve center of Lashkar-e-Taiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Markaz Subhan Allah, Bahawalpur:** Base of Masood Azhar (designated terrorist by UN in 2019) and headquarters of Jaish-e-Mohammed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Sadna Bilal Camp, Muzaffarabad:** Used for training Lashkar and Jaish recruits by Pakistan's Special Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Sawai Nala Camp, Muzaffarabad:** Where terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack were trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Other Sites:** Included initial induction, indoctrination, and training centers for terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

### Admissions and Denials
Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif admitted that for the last three decades, Pakistan has been doing "dirty work" for America, the West, and Britain by backing, supporting, training, and funding terrorist organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan also admitted that jihadist outfits have existed and operated in Pakistan for decades, stemming from the US-led Afghan war against the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

Despite these admissions of past mistakes, Pakistani officials often enter "denial mode" regarding current issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. Khawaja Asif claimed that Lashkar-e-Taiba no longer exists in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor highlighted Pakistan's "master of denial" habit, citing its initial denials regarding the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

### Continued Terrorist Activity and State Complicity
Evidence suggests that Pakistan's claims of shutting down terror groups are false:
*   **Jaish-e-Mohammed's Expansion:** Satellite imagery from late 2022 shows that Jaish-e-Mohammed's base in Bahawalpur has doubled in size since 2011-12, now spreading over 18 acres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. This expansion accelerated after Pakistan was removed from the [[role_of_international_organizations_like_fatf_in_monitoring_pakistan | FATF grey list]] in October 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
*   **Open Operations:** Jaish-e-Mohammed's hideouts in Bahawalpur, Markaz Subhan Allah and Usman-o-Ali Mosque, are openly operating as indoctrination and training centers for terrorists, with one complex just 8km from a Pakistani military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.
*   **Land Acquisition:** In October 2022, Jaish-e-Mohammed purchased 4 acres of new land to expand its Bahawalpur complex, with the land sold by the local numberdar to Abdul Rauf, brother of Masood Azhar (designated terrorist by US in 2010) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
*   **State Funerals for Terrorists:** Photos show Abdul Rauf leading funeral prayers for killed terrorists, with Pakistani military personnel and the Pakistan flag on coffins in the background, implying state funerals for terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
*   **Child Radicalization:** A Jaish-e-Mohammed children's magazine, "Muslim Bacche," was found encouraging 600 children in a madrassa to support jihad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   **Lashkar-e-Taiba's Narco-Trafficking:** Lashkar-e-Taiba uses narco-trafficking to weaken India by selling drugs to its youth and funding terror activities with the proceeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. A 2021 seizure of over 2900 kg of heroin at Mundra Port (worth â‚¹21000 crores) was part of this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. Another 70 kg of heroin was seized near Mundra Port in July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Terror Operations:** Lashkar-e-Taiba, formed in 1986, has been linked to numerous terror operations, including the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament, July 2006 Mumbai local train blasts, and played a role in the 26/11 attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. Lashkar terrorist David Headley coordinated with Pakistani intelligence officers for the 2008 Mumbai attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>.
*   **Jamaat-ud-Dawa:** Lashkar-e-Taiba's charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, is considered the same entity by the US, Australia, and the UN, and despite being banned by Pakistan in 2019, it aligns with the Pakistani security establishment's nationalist Islamist agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. It has even been used by the Pakistan government to implement its agenda in Balochistan and fight the Islamic State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

## Impact on Pakistan
The [[impact_of_terrorism_on_pakistans_internal_security_and_society | impact of terrorism on Pakistan's internal security and society]] is severe:
*   **Internal Attacks:** Terrorist organizations like Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) have carried out attacks within Pakistan. The TTP claimed responsibility for the horrific 2014 [[impact_of_terrorism_on_pakistans_internal_security_and_society | Peshawar school attack]] that killed at least 132 innocent children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. The TTP has killed over 80,000 Pakistanis in the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Both TTP and Baloch insurgents have killed Pakistani Army personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Declining Safety:** Pakistan ranks 140th out of 163 countries in the 2024 Global Peace Index, indicating extreme unsafety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>. The Centre for Research and Security Studies (an Islamabad-based think tank) reported that 2024 has been the deadliest year for Pakistan Security Forces in a decade, with 40% more attacks than the previous year. Out of 905 incidents, 444 were Islamist terrorist attacks, killing 685 soldiers and police officers, and 927 civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.
*   **Political Instability and Economic Hardship:** Pakistan's politics are characterized by power-hungry politicians, a disregard for the constitution and democracy, and no Prime Minister having completed a full 5-year term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. This instability, coupled with economic struggles, has led to stampedes during free food and flour distribution, resulting in deaths and injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.

These issues highlight that Pakistan has become a "hell" due to its continued support for terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.

The [[james_webb_space_telescope_discoveries | James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)]] utilizes advanced infrared imaging and spectrography to explore the universe, providing unprecedented views and data on distant celestial bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These technologies allow scientists to observe phenomena like star formation and death, distant galaxies, and the atmospheric composition of exoplanets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## James Webb Space Telescope and Infrared Capabilities

The JWST is designed to primarily work with the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Its wavelength capture range is from 0.6 to 28 micrometers, with a small overlap with visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This capability is crucial because the longer wavelengths of infrared light can penetrate through gas and dust clouds, allowing scientists to see objects that would otherwise be obscured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Infrared Cameras
The JWST is equipped with two main infrared cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>:
*   **Near Infrared Camera (NIRCAM)**: Captures shorter infrared wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Images taken with NIRCAM often show dust clouds clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI Cam)**: Captures longer infrared wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Due to its longer wavelength capture, MIRI Cam can peer through dense dust clouds, muting their appearance and revealing objects at the center, such as the two stars within the nebula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Spectrography Instrument
In addition to its cameras, the JWST is equipped with a **Near Infra-Red Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. A spectrograph is an instrument that measures the intensity of various wavelengths of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Principles of Spectrography

Spectrography relies on the principle that different elements and molecules absorb or emit light at specific, unique wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. By analyzing the "fingerprint" of light — which wavelengths are absorbed or blocked — scientists can deduce the chemical composition of a distant object, even without a direct image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### How it Works
*   **Light Absorption**: When light passes through a substance, certain wavelengths are absorbed. For example, chlorophyll in plants absorbs red and blue light, making leaves appear green (the wavelength it doesn't absorb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Similarly, water absorbs red, yellow, and orange wavelengths, making oceans appear blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: A spectrograph measures which wavelengths are blocked or absorbed as light passes through an atmosphere or material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. By comparing these absorption patterns to known patterns of molecules, scientists can identify the presence of specific elements or compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The graph shows light wavelengths on the X-axis and the amount of light blocked on the Y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Discoveries through Infrared Imaging and Spectrography

### Understanding Star Life Cycles
Infrared imaging has provided incredible insights into [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | star life cycles]].
*   **Stellar Death**: Images show the death of a star, specifically a [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | planetary nebula]] formed by a dying star releasing clouds of gases and dust over thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Two stars are seen orbiting each other, with the brighter one being younger and the dimmer one dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Stellar Birth**: The "Cosmic Cliffs" of the [[star_life_cycles_and_nebula_formation | Carina Nebula]] show regions where stars are being born, appearing as growing infant stars (red dots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Glimpse into the Early Universe
JWST's first photo of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 provides a glimpse 13 billion years into the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **[[galaxy_formation_and_gravitational_lensing | Gravitational Lensing]]**: Galaxies closer to the camera distort the light from behind them due to their strong gravitational force, creating a magnifying effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This phenomenon allows scientists to see more distant objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The redder galaxies in the image are farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Characterizing Exoplanets and the [[search_for_extraterrestrial_life | Search for Extraterrestrial Life]]
One of the most significant applications of spectrography is in [[understanding_exoplanets_and_habitability | understanding exoplanets and habitability]].
*   **WASP-96B**: The NIRISS instrument analyzed the light from WASP-96B, an [[understanding_exoplanets_and_habitability | exoplanet]] 1,150 light-years away, for 6.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The resulting light curve confirmed the presence of water (H2O), haze, and clouds in its atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. However, with a temperature exceeding 530°C, WASP-96B is not considered habitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

*   **TRAPPIST-1E**: The JWST is expected to analyze TRAPPIST-1E, an [[understanding_exoplanets_and_habitability | exoplanet]] only 40 light-years away (380 trillion km) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. It is considered the most promising candidate for habitability found so far due to its similarities to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>:
    *   Orbits an ultra-cool dwarf star, TRAPPIST-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
    *   Its temperature remains within the habitable zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
    *   Dimensions similar to Earth: radius 91% of Earth's, mass 77%, density 102%, and surface gravity 93% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
    *   Confirmed solid rock surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
    *   Liquid water can exist on its surface without freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Scientists will check TRAPPIST-1E's atmosphere for a specific combination of carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, which could indicate the presence of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The criteria for an [[understanding_exoplanets_and_habitability | exoplanet]] to sustain life are believed to be the presence of liquid water, a solid surface, and a specific combination of gases in its atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

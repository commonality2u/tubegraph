The oarfish, a creature typically found in the deep ocean, holds a significant place in Japanese folklore, often associated with impending natural disasters.

## The Oarfish in Japanese Beliefs
There is a centuries-old Japanese belief that the appearance of an oarfish above water is a sign of a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This belief specifically links oarfish sightings to earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. A notable instance cited is the devastating 2011 earthquake in Japan, which was preceded by the discovery of approximately 20 dead oarfish bodies on the Japanese coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Recent Sightings and Shifting Perspectives
Oarfish are typically found deep in the sea, usually around 1 kilometer (approximately 0.6 miles) below the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Until a few years ago, spotting an oarfish was considered a rare event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, with the first live oarfish only being filmed in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

However, recent years have seen an increased frequency of oarfish appearances, leading to the questioning of these traditional stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Notable sightings include:
*   **January 2023** In Japan, a fisherman retrieved a strange, long fish from his net, which was later identified as a Deep Sea Oarfish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The fish was approximately 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) long, with a sticky, rubbery white body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The fisherman released it back into the sea due to the legend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **2023** A fisherman reportedly caught 50 oarfish in a single haul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **2024** Oarfish were spotted three times in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **February 2025** A live oarfish was sighted in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The increased frequency of these sightings, alongside other [[deep_sea_creatures_and_their_habitats | deep sea creatures]] being spotted at the surface level, has raised questions about their sudden appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. One theory is that these creatures are migrating from the deep sea to surface waters due to changes in their habitat, such as oxygen shortages caused by climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

Conquest's Second Law posits that any institution not explicitly right-wing will inevitably become left-wing over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Tyler Cowan discussed his perspective on this law, its applicability, and the nature of political definitions.

## Tyler Cowan's Perspective on Conquest's Second Law

Cowan expressed skepticism about the universal truth of Conquest's Second Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Limited Applicability and Counter-examples
While acknowledging that a version of the law might have held true for the United States during a significant part of the post-war era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, Cowan emphasized it is not a universal phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
He provided counter-examples:
*   **The World Bank:** Described as "quite sort of Centrist statist in the 1960s," it became "fairly neoliberal" by the 1990s. Cowan noted this transformation is complex and not a simple case of the law holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Historical Periods:** Cowan questioned whether periods like the French Revolution through the 1830 restoration showed a consistent move to the left, finding it unconvincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Figures like Napoleon also defy easy left-right categorization [[napoleons_influence_and_parallels_to_startup_founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Explanations for Political Shifts in the US
For the American context where the law appears more applicable locally, Cowan suggested that the shift of the American intelligentsia to the left can be understood through:
*   **Educational Polarization:** He referred to political science literature on this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Political Realignments:** Factors such as "Republicans act wacky Or democrats sort more [and] the issues realign in particular ways" contribute to these local trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Cowan clarified that he does not believe there's something inherent in intellectual life that makes people left-wing; rather, these shifts are particular to the current moment [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Challenges to the Definitions of "Left-Wing" and "Right-Wing"

A significant part of Cowan's critique revolves around the ambiguity and historical contingency of the terms "left-wing" and "right-wing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

*   **Lack of Stable Definition:** He argued that "left-wing is not even well defined," making it difficult for Conquest's Law to hold consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Historical Contingency vs. Universal Categories:** Cowan mentioned a debate with Mark Andreessen, highlighting his own view that "left-wing" and "right-wing" are not "universal historical categories" [[historical_analysis_of_world_war_i_and_world_war_ii]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. He questioned how these terms would apply to medieval times or even 17th-century England, finding such applications "unsatisfying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Fluidity of Political Axes:** He emphasized the "lot of fluidity in how these axes play out over real issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Redefinition of "Left":** The host referenced Byrne Hobart's idea that "if the left keeps winning then just redefine what the left is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. An example discussed was Prohibition, initially a left-wing cause, while today the opposite stance (anti-prohibition) is considered left-wing [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Cowan concluded that due to these definitional issues and historical counter-examples, Conquest's Second Law is often "not so economical" in explaining institutional shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

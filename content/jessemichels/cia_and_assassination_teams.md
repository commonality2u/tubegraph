Danny Sheen suggests that the [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) has been involved in major American historical events, including assassinations. He claims to have an understanding of these events due to his extensive legal career, representing individuals involved in various conspiracies and having access to sensitive files. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>

## Formation of the Central Intelligence Agency
The [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | Central Intelligence Agency]] was reportedly the "brainchild" of individuals at Brown Brothers Harriman, an investment company composed of wealthy Gilded Age families. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a> Robert Lovett, a senior partner at Brown Brothers Harriman, is credited with writing the original memo to President Truman recommending the creation of the [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | Central Intelligence Agency]] with a covert operations capacity, authorized under Section 5412. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:15">[01:50:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:25">[01:50:25]</a>

## The S Force: An Assassination Team
An assassination team, code-named "S Force," was allegedly created in 1960 by then-Vice President Richard Nixon. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a> This force was initially intended to eliminate Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and Che Guevara. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>

The formation process reportedly involved:
*   Nixon contacting Howard Hughes, who was a secret consultant to the National Security Council and involved in sensitive military programs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>
*   Hughes assigned his lawyer, Bob Mayu, to set up the team. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>
*   Mayu then contacted mafia figures Johnny Roselli and Sam Giancana. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:29">[01:39:29]</a>
*   Santos Trafficante, a mob boss in Havana with connections to heroin trafficking, was brought in. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a> Trafficante selected 15 former gunmen, who had been recruited by the [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | Central Intelligence Agency]] for "Operation 40," a covert operation against Cuba aimed at destroying its economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:14">[01:43:14]</a>
*   Paul Helwell, head of the Southeast Asia Supply Corporation and a full-time [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | Central Intelligence Agency]] operative, was involved in the partnership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>
*   Sheffield Edwards, the chief of security for the [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | Central Intelligence Agency]], greenlit the creation of this assassination team. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:34">[01:42:34]</a>

## JFK Assassination and the S Force
President John F. Kennedy was reportedly unaware of the S Force until June 5, 1963. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:52">[01:45:52]</a> The motivation for JFK's assassination is tied to his private communication with Nikita Khrushchev following the Cuban Missile Crisis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:32">[01:47:32]</a> Kennedy and Khrushchev secretly agreed to begin disassembling the nuclear warheads of their respective arsenals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:05">[01:48:05]</a>

Allen Dulles, the first civilian head of the [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | CIA]], vehemently opposed this plan, viewing Kennedy as a "traitor" for attempting to dismantle the primary military capacity of the United States. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:27">[01:49:27]</a> Dulles returned to Brown Brothers Harriman and, with their "green light," tasked the existing S Force with assassinating Kennedy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:35">[01:59:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:40">[01:59:40]</a>

Key details of the assassination theory include:
*   Roger Morales, an S Force member, is identified as the key shooter from the grassy knoll. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>
*   Lee Harvey Oswald was allegedly intended to take a shot, but not kill Kennedy, to create a pretext to blame Cuba. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:43">[02:02:43]</a>
*   Dallas Mayor Earl Cabell (brother of [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | CIA]] officer Charles Cabell, who had authority in Project Blue Book) was involved in rerouting JFK's motorcade. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:28">[02:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:40">[02:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:45">[02:01:45]</a>
*   Jack Ruby, a "mob guy," killed Oswald. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:45">[02:03:45]</a> Ruby reportedly tried to speak directly to Earl Warren about what was really happening. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:24">[02:04:24]</a>
*   Lyndon B. Johnson and George H.W. Bush were allegedly notified beforehand about the assassination. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:53">[01:59:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:28">[02:00:28]</a>

## Watergate and Assassination Connections
The Watergate break-in is also linked to these assassination teams. The four individuals involved in the break-in were "S Force guys," including E. Howard Hunt (liaison to Operation Mongoose and allegedly involved in the JFK assassination) and Frank Sturgis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:24">[02:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a> Nixon's "Smoking Gun" conversation refers to concerns that investigating the money trail from Bernard Barker's pocket would lead back to the "Cuban guys" trained in assassination in Mexico, thus connecting to the Kennedy assassination. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:08">[02:22:08]</a>

James McCord, a CIA wiretapping specialist involved in Watergate, blew the whistle because he believed he was being "sold down the stream." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:37">[02:29:37]</a> He was told the DNC break-in was a national security matter related to anti-Vietnam demonstrations, not a political one. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:53">[02:29:53]</a> Lee Bailey, McCord's lawyer, was one of four attorneys on retainer for the [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | Central Intelligence Agency]] for operatives caught stateside in covert operations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:15">[02:28:15]</a>

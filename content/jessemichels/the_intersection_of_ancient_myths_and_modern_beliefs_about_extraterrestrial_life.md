The speaker and guest discuss the evolution of beliefs regarding non-human entities, suggesting that modern perceptions of aliens have roots in ancient myths and religious experiences.

## Historical Perceptions of Non-Human Entities
Historically, humanity has always been surrounded by phenomena now referred to as "aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. These entities were previously known by different names, including muses, angels, demons, jinn, sylphs, fairies, boulder grinders, gnomes, and elves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

Terence McKenna pondered whether these phenomena are "autonomous fragments of psychic energy temporarily escaped from the controlling power of the ego" or if they "actually exist in some kind of like freestanding autonomous reality with which we occasionally have congress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The speaker suggests that modern experiences might be a result of "widening the doors of perception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

## The Roswell Divide
According to Diana Pasulka, a religious studies professor and author of *American Cosmic*, a significant shift occurred around 1947, the year of the Roswell incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Before 1947, people reported seeing angels, demons, or other figures from contemporary folklore like jinn or leprechauns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Post-1947, the prevailing "mythos" shifted, and people began to report seeing aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This concept is explored further in [[historical_religious_contact_experiences_and_modern_ufos]].

## Precursors to Modern UFO Sightings
Even before the 1940s, in the late 19th century, there were widespread sightings of "airships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. These were described as strange configurations in the sky, sometimes resembling hot air balloons, and were reportedly piloted by humanoid beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. These "airship" occupants would occasionally descend, converse with people on farms, and then depart in technology comprehensible at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. These events can be seen as precursors to modern alien visitation accounts.

## The Transformative Nature of Contact Experiences
These modern visitation events are described as a "modern mystery event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While some experiencers report trauma and even "radiation burns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, others are "transformed for the better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. These positive transformations can manifest as an "overwhelming sense of love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, akin to a "gnostic hierophany or revelation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. This transformative aspect draws parallels with the effects of psychedelics and other "breakthrough moments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

The speaker speculates that if there is an "ambassadorial program" between an invisible world and our own, it has "been around for forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, merely taking different forms and guises throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

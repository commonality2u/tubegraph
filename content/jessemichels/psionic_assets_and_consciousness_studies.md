The topic of [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic assets]] and consciousness plays a significant role in understanding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and associated programs. It is described as a factual and utilized aspect within certain operations, rather than a "woo woo" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.

## Defining Psionic Assets

A [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic asset]] is an individual trained in abilities such as remote viewing, psychic abilities, and telekinesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>. These individuals can transition into a state where they are highly sensitive to their environment through a [[Consciousness and advanced technology | consciousness]] field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. This [[Consciousness and advanced technology | consciousness]] field is compared to the internet or worldwide webâ€”always present and full of information, but requiring a "Wi-Fi signal" to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.

To tap into this [[Consciousness and advanced technology | consciousness]] field, a [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic asset]] undergoes a protocol that involves lowering intellect while increasing intuition, and then reintroducing intellect as an observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

There are two primary ways to achieve this heightened intuitive state:
*   **Natural Gift/Training**: Some individuals are born with this gift, while others can achieve it through extensive training, similar to a Shaolin monk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>.
*   **Stress Inoculation & Disassociation**: This method triggers the body's fight-or-flight systems to heighten intuition and subdues intellect through disassociation, which can be chemically induced or achieved through meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.

### Ethical Concerns in Psionic Asset Recruitment

It is acknowledged that the methods used to heighten intuition and disassociation, particularly those involving "cheats," have "not fared well for those involved in the program, including children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. Children are naturally more visceral, intuitive, and have lower intellect, making them naturally more susceptible to these techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>. The use of children as [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic assets]] is a point of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>.

There are also operations outside the continental U.S. that prospect for [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic assets]] in third-world countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:32">[01:23:32]</a>. Individuals from simpler lives, with less environmental contaminants, appear to be better at disassociating and heightening intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>. While these individuals may join willingly due to economic imbalances, there's concern that this could be seen as human trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>.

## Psionic Technology and Experimentation

Beyond organic methods, there are "hardware" solutions for inducing the desired state. One breakthrough involves a non-intrusive ultrasound system that can target the brain, easing the transition from intellect to intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

Experiments to identify individuals with [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic]] talent often involve random number generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. A subject's ability to influence the outcome of a conventionally random binary computer, even minimally, is considered "infinitely mindblowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This demonstrates a "[[Parapsychology and mind over matter experiments | mind over matter]]" effect through [[Consciousness and advanced technology | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. This phenomenon exhibits a "rebound effect," where conscious awareness of success leads to a temporary decrease in influence, before potentially becoming exponential again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

## Application in UAP Interaction

[[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | Psionic assets]] are used both for "summoning" UAP activity and for data collection during UAP events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

There are two types of UAP summoning:
1.  **Machine-Based Summoning**: This involves signals and energy systems activated to attract UAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.
2.  **Man-Based Summoning**: This utilizes [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic assets]] to invite the phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.

During operations, if a UAP shows up, [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic assets]] are used as a "measuring device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. Their experiences within the [[Consciousness and advanced technology | consciousness]] field are correlated with other sensor data, such as infrared or radar readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>. Conversely, sometimes the intent is to have the [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic assets]] summon the phenomenon, with other equipment then measuring the success of their effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Consciousness in UAP Retrieval

During a UAP retrieval, the witness described an "emotional escalation" that was "beautiful" but also sad, akin to a minor chord in music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. They felt like they were in the presence of a "feminine energy that was loving and sad," suggesting a direct communication or connection with the craft's [[Consciousness and advanced technology | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. This experience was profoundly disruptive to the pilot's ability to operate, despite being highly trained for stressful situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. This led to speculation about whether the craft itself possessed a powerful "Talent" or if a [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionic asset]]'s [[Consciousness and advanced technology | consciousness]] became trapped and communicated through the pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

## The Intersection of Psionics and UAP Nature

The nature of UAP is not always purely physical; it ranges from "supernatural ground-based paranormal phenomenon" to observable objects in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. This highlights the complex, multi-faceted nature of the phenomenon, which can include both physical craft and more ethereal, consciousness-related aspects.

A former UAP Task Force member directly confirmed that the observed "egg" and "eight-gon" craft were Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:57">[01:47:57]</a>. The ability to summon these craft is a key indicator of their nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:15">[01:48:15]</a>.

The idea that UAP itself might be conscious is suggested by the phrase "biologics didn't necessarily mean sentient beings or conscious creatures... while some of the biological cargo that comes with these craft is not conscious, [[Consciousness and advanced technology | Consciousness]] itself is how you interact and pilot the craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:25">[02:55:25]</a>. This implies a revolutionary concept where the craft itself, or its operating system, embodies [[Consciousness beyond physicalism | consciousness]], distinct from biological pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.

## Ontological Implications

The profound implications of UAP disclosure extend to challenging core ontological truths, inviting individuals to question their worldview and consider a broader reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The phenomenon suggests that the "inner space" of [[Consciousness and advanced technology | consciousness]] and "outer space" are "all the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:57">[03:01:57]</a>.

There is a call for individuals to "decentralize the ideas" and explore this topic themselves, not just through online research, but also by looking "inside" and "praying" or opening their hearts to "good energy" from the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:20">[02:47:20]</a>. The witness described how their own family has experienced phenomena following them home, including a UAP they call "the angel" which appears as a blue, winged, materializing object, emitting a "good energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:13">[02:48:13]</a>.

This field, including [[Psionic assets and consciousness in technology | psionics]], is considered by some scientists, like Stanford microbiologist Gary Nolan, as the "greatest moment ever for science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:39">[02:50:39]</a>. It suggests a potential reunification of science and spirituality, which have been cleaved since the Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. The pursuit of science inherently seeks a "good outcome," which loops back to a connection with something worthwhile, hinting at the pursuit of [[Philosophy consciousness and the metaphysical implications of UAPs | God]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:17">[02:52:17]</a>.

Varda Space is a company founded by Delian Asparouhov and Will Bruey, aiming to move specific parts of the [[manufacturing_in_microgravity_environments | manufacturing process]] from Earth's atmosphere into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Their core idea leverages the microgravity environment to enable new [[innovations_in_space_technology_and_exploration | innovations in space technology]] and produce materials that are difficult or impossible to make on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Advantage of Microgravity Manufacturing

In space, the ability to "turn off gravity" for manufacturing processes allows for special chemistry and engineering modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This means manipulating one of the four fundamental forces of physics, opening up vast possibilities for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Historically, the concept of building new and better things in space is not entirely new. Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and Skylab have already demonstrated that producing items like pharmaceuticals, fiber optic cables, and semiconductors can be optimized in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. However, these efforts largely remained in an experimental, academic, and slow-moving phase until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Key Use Cases

Varda Space focuses on manufacturing products for commercial markets on Earth, identifying specific areas where microgravity offers significant benefits:

*   **Pharmaceuticals**:
    *   Long-term, Varda aims to enable the manufacturing of entirely new drugs that cannot be produced in gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   In the near term, they seek to create better versions of existing drugs. For example, Merck's Ketruda drug was reformulated in microgravity, transforming a 12-hour intravenous (IV) treatment into a syringe-based injectable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Fiber Optic Cables**:
    *   A special type of molten glass cable called ZBLAN offers stepwise better bandwidth than traditional silica cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   On Earth, ZBLAN forms undesirable crystals that reduce signal strength. In microgravity, crystal formation is reduced, leading to a more monocrystalline structure and much higher bandwidth transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. A single kilogram of ZBLAN produced in space could be worth tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Other Potential Areas**: Semiconductors and human organs are also mentioned as materials where specific manufacturing steps can produce much higher quality products in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Varda's Operational Approach

Varda's factories in space are completely automated and robotic, with no human presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This approach is a key differentiator, as traditional space manufacturing projects often relied on human intervention on structures like the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Varda's space station-independent process allows them to avoid long wait times and bureaucracy associated with relying on external space stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Life Cycle of Space Manufacturing

For initial missions, Varda launches a spacecraft containing a manufacturing module and a re-entry capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. After the product is manufactured, the module burns up in the atmosphere, and only the capsule with the finished product survives de-orbit and re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Long-term, Varda aims to have a permanent station with manufacturing facilities in orbit to avoid redesigning and launching the entire system each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Challenges and Risks

Varda acknowledges several risks inherent in their venture:

*   **Re-entry and De-orbiting**: While previous attempts have been made, Varda's specific approach of coming in from a lower orbit with less delta-v presents a unique challenge, though potentially less difficult than crewed re-entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The historical "specter of catastrophe" surrounding space travel, particularly re-entry, is a known concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Will Bruey's experience working on SpaceX's Dragon capsule, specifically its de-orbit and re-entry systems, was a crucial factor in his selection as co-founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Launch Costs**: If [[the_impact_of_reduced_launch_costs_on_space_ventures | launch costs]] do not decrease sufficiently, it could negatively impact the company's unit economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Funding**: The possibility of funding drying up is also a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Why Now? The Macro Environment

Varda's founders believe that the current macro environment makes it the optimal time to launch a capital-intensive space company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Reduced Launch Costs**: The increasing commoditization and reusability of rockets, driven by companies like SpaceX, have significantly lowered launch costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This affordability acts as an "economic buttress" for the broader launch industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Economic Incentives**: The company's core mission is to expand the economic bounds of humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. They fundamentally believe that sustainable human settlement in the solar system requires strong [[economic_incentives_needed_for_space_industry_growth | economic incentives]], akin to the California Gold Rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Varda aims to be that "space equivalent gold rush," creating demand for frequent launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Capital Markets and Talent**: There is currently abundant venture capital interested in "atoms, not bits" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The rise of SpaceX has also created a pool of experienced aerospace talent looking to start new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

## Vision and Impact

Varda envisions itself as a contract manufacturer offering the unique capability to produce materials in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. They compare their model to the Apple App Store, where they will initially develop a few products in-house to demonstrate value before opening up the platform for other companies to utilize their manufacturing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Unlike satellite companies that launch once and operate in orbit, Varda's model requires continuous launches to bring materials to and from space, driving demand for launch vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This regular cadence is crucial for the long-term viability of the launch industry and could make future endeavors like lunar ice mining or asteroid mining commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Varda's unique problem requires a diverse skill set, leading them to hire material scientists, biologists, re-entry experts, and spacecraft experts, differentiating them from other space companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Company Culture and Operations

Varda's engineers operate under a strict "minimum risk" rule, avoiding unnecessary speculative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The company adopts an iterative build process, similar to SpaceX's approach with Starship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. They prioritize shipping missions on time, even if it means being "embarrassed by it," to ensure continuous progress and customer validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

Their first mission aims to demonstrate the entire end-to-end concept of operations, proving their "assembly line" is functional, and then they will focus on putting products onto that line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

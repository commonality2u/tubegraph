The "future human hypothesis" posits that supposed "aliens" are in fact humans from the future who have mastered time travel and are visiting the past [01:04:04]. This theory offers an explanation for the [[UFOs and Human Consciousness | UFO phenomena]] [01:04:04].

## Proponents and Core Ideas

Dr. Michael P. Masters, a biological anthropologist and professor at Montana Tech University, is a leading proponent of this theory [00:41:09]. He has authored books such as *Identified Flying Objects*, *The Extratempestrial Model*, and *Revelation: The Future Human Past*, in which he develops a framework explaining that "aliens" are future humans [00:46:00].

Other notable figures who support this hypothesis include:
*   **Navy Commander George Hoover:** Stated that beings involved in the Roswell crash were time-traveling humans [01:55:01].
*   **Herman Oberth:** The "father of German rocketry" and Wernher Von Braun's mentor, suggested UFOs don't traverse vast cosmic distances but "jump from one time space coordinate to another" [02:00:00].
*   **Steven Spielberg:** May have included [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | time travel]] hints in *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, with World War II pilots appearing unaged [02:10:55]. According to Deadpool Creator Robert Liefeld, Spielberg pondered in 1993, "What's easier to believe, that we are being monitored by aliens from another world or that we are monitoring ourselves and studying us from the future?" [02:27:06]
*   **Tom DeLonge:** The Blink-182 frontman and To The Stars Academy founder, stated in a Newsweek article that these phenomena "aren't coming from other planets, these things might be coming through time" [02:41:00].
*   **Paul Hynek:** One of J. Allen Hynek's sons, questioned why these beings would find or care about us unless we were their ancestors or they were set to inherit the planet [02:52:00].

## Characteristics of "Aliens" and Human Evolution

The hypothesis suggests that the physical characteristics commonly attributed to "gray aliens" align with potential [[biological_evolution_and_future_humans | human evolution]]:
*   **Eyes:** Often described as slits, possibly due to increased screen time in the future [01:13:00].
*   **Noses and Ears:** Gray aliens have very small noses and ears, consistent with a reduced reliance on senses essential for hunter-gathering like smell and hearing [01:23:00].
*   **Childlike Appearance:** The concept of neoteny suggests distant descendants of a species might resemble its current children, and gray aliens are frequently described as childlike, often around three feet tall [01:28:00].
*   **Human-like Qualities:** They can breathe our air, engage in sexual reproduction with us, and speak our languages [00:33:00]. This suite of characteristics "scream[s] time traveling future humans" [00:36:00].
*   **Friendly Interactions:** A study referenced by Dr. Masters, involving 3,500 to 5,000 "contactees" or "experiencers," found that 52% encountered hominid-like creatures, and 85% of those interactions were friendly or neutral [06:11:00]. This suggests a "care for us" potentially to "Ascend into them or ensure their own sustenance" [06:57:00]. Conversely, those who interacted with less human-like forms reported more negative experiences [07:07:00].

One argument against this is that advanced extraterrestrials could bioengineer beings to look like humans for "ease of communication and acceptance" [09:50:00]. However, Dr. Masters questions why they would create something that looks like our distant future selves rather than exactly like us [10:28:00]. His recent book, *Revelation: The Future Human Past*, explores the idea of robotic or biologically constructed "avatars" created through advanced [[genetic_data_and_its_implications_for_future_technologies | genetic manipulation]] [10:41:00].

## Evidence for Time Travel and Intent

### UFOs as Time Machines
The physical characteristics and reported effects of UFOs align with time travel theories:
*   **Form Follows Function:** The saucer-shaped or disc-shaped craft are consistent with the function of manipulating spacetime, as predicted by physics [07:06:00, 20:00:00].
*   **Electromagnetism:** Strong electromagnetism is often reported around UFOs [03:14:00]. If time travel involves traversable wormholes, significant electromagnetic fallout would be expected [17:11:00].
    *   UFO researcher Steve Mea notes a "ridiculous correlation" between electromagnetic and geomagnetic anomalies and significant UFO instances over 200 years [16:44:00].
    *   Places like Skinwalker Ranch, known for paranormal activity, exhibit high electromagnetic activity, suggesting they might be "launch and landing pads for UFOs" [17:33:00, 18:29:00].
*   **Spacetime Manipulation:** Saucer-shaped craft are consistent with manipulating spacetime [18:04:00]. Theories by Frank Tipler, stemming from Einstein's 1915 paper, suggest that rapidly rotating rings, spheres, or discs could enable time travel by tipping light cones through rotation [21:03:00]. These craft are often seen rotating and "popping in and out of SpaceTime" [21:19:00].
*   **Time Anomalies:** Experiencers often report "missing time" or time anomalies [03:09:00].
    *   Corporal Armando in Chile (1970s) disappeared for 15 minutes but experienced five days pass for him, indicated by his wristwatch and beard growth [22:26:00].
    *   Travis Walton reportedly grew a beard after his abduction experience, and trees around his abduction site grew faster [22:46:00].
    *   Linda Jones in Manchester, UK, observed grass growing rapidly under her feet while fleeing a UFO [23:04:00].
    *   Amy Ryaans was transported 790 km away and experienced 5-7 days on board a craft, only to be dropped off at a petrol station near her original location, seemingly returning closer to the time she was taken [23:17:00].
*   **Internal Mechanics:** Udo Wartena, a miner, was reportedly shown counter-rotating flywheels inside a UFO that generate an electromagnetic field crucial for anti-gravity propulsion and spacetime manipulation [24:06:00].

### The [[genetic_data_and_its_implications_for_future_technologies | Intertemporal Breeding Program]]
A consistent theme in abduction cases, especially from the 1970s to 1990s, is the extraction of human gametes and the implantation/removal of fetuses [13:54:00].
*   **Antonio Vilas Boas (1957):** Described "mating" with a future human extraterrestrial being [13:06:00]. The woman had human-like features, suggesting a shared species with the ability to reproduce [15:21:00].
*   **Barney Hill:** Reluctantly stated that sperm samples were taken from him [13:20:00].
*   **Jim Penniston (Rendlesham Forest Incident, 1980):** Recalled a contact experience where beings wanted to maintain genetic diversity and prevent being "wiped off the planet" by taking samples from current humans [13:29:00]. He was told they came from 8,000 years in the future and faced reproductive problems [15:06:00].

This interest in human genetics is contextualized by declining human fertility:
*   Average male sperm count is 59% of what it was in 1973 [12:31:00].
*   Testosterone has been dropping 1% year-over-year since the 1980s [12:38:00].
*   Pesticides have been linked to significantly lower sperm counts [12:47:00].
*   A 2011 study showed average sperm count down to 47 million per milliliter, with fertility issues starting below 40 million [14:46:00].
*   Humanity is becoming [[biological_evolution_and_future_humans | domesticated]], with selection for more pro-social behaviors since the advent of agriculture [12:29:00, 16:01:00].

### "Gifted" Technology and Advanced Materials
David Grusch, a UFO whistleblower, mentioned that some non-human "crashed or landed" vehicles were "gifted" to humans, providing a technological advantage [24:48:00]. These craft reportedly contain "super weird" heavy elements like europium and californium in "Atomic Arrangements that make like no sense" [25:11:00]. These "metamaterial properties" are not yet understood by current human science [25:40:00].

Early inventors like Townsend Brown, known for anti-gravity research, were also interested in [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | time travel]] [26:16:00]. His confidant, Morgan, reportedly confirmed that his "gravitator" machines were in fact "time machines" [27:11:00].

## Personal Experiences and Broader Implications

### Dr. Masters' Experience
Dr. Masters recounts a personal experience with "future human visitors" [04:03:00]. After feeling exhausted and considering quitting his UFO research, two individuals physically approached him [30:06:00]. They communicated telepathically, stating, "We know you've been thinking about quitting lately and we'd really prefer you didn't do that" [31:30:00]. He realized they knew his unvoiced thoughts [31:37:00]. They then offered to "black [his] eyes out and give [him] three things that will be important at a future time" [33:00:00]. Upon agreement, his eyes "went black" and he felt "all of this information coming in my brain" [34:02:00]. He couldn't access this information but felt it was deposited [34:22:00]. He concluded he had been interacting with them in various ways throughout his life, including the "little voice in my head" that guided his academic path [33:27:00, 29:27:00]. This suggests a form of [[Theories on NonHuman Intelligence Among Humans | non-human intelligence among humans]] or "walking among us" [38:08:00].

### [[Consciousness and advanced technology | Consciousness]], [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | Time Loops]], and Remote Viewing
The connection between UFOs and psychic remote viewing is explored [38:40:00]. The brain might function as a "room temperature Quantum system" that collapses probabilistic quantum reality into classical reality, as hypothesized by Roger Penrose [40:07:00].
*   **Quantum Computers:** In some interpretations, quantum computers may be able to send information back in time [40:47:00]. This suggests that remote viewers' brains might be "super robust quantum computers" sending future UFO sightings back in time, creating a "pre-memory of your future knowledge state" [41:01:00].
*   **Time Loops:** The concept of a [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | Time Loop]] is exemplified by Carl Jung's scarab beetle story, where a future event (the patient's dream) influences the present (Jung finding a beetle), creating a causal loop [41:32:00]. Similarly, UFO experiences, often described as dream-like, might be "glitching into the future" and affecting life in ways that cause events to manifest [42:24:00]. Remote viewing, in this view, is primarily precognition, relaying information back to one's past self [42:48:00].

## The "Cosmic Timeline War" and Future Outlook
The "future human hypothesis" also touches on the potential for a "cosmic timeline war" [48:46:00]. On one side, advanced humans from the future, living in a "trans temporal Dimension," struggle to communicate with present-day humans [48:51:00]. On the other, forces seek to exploit human consciousness through distractions and tribalism [49:01:00].

UFOs appearing around nuclear programs and attempting to monitor, shut down, or activate facilities would make "complete sense in the context of future humans trying to maintain their ideal timeline and maybe even ensure their own existence" [49:46:00].

Humanity may be on the "precipice of a massive revolution in human consciousness," where we either evolve together or "bifurcate and still evolve there but in a very different way" [50:22:00]. The ancient practice of cranial deformation, ubiquitous throughout the world, which resulted in head shapes reminiscent of "gray alien" physiology, may have been due to ancestors being "instructed by the gods to do this more like them" [46:21:00, 46:51:00].

Ultimately, the idea is that [[UFOs and Human Consciousness | humans report seeing UFOs]] in heightened states of consciousness, possibly when they are "closest to their future selves" [50:47:00]. This suggests that "God's finger is extended to its maximum but Adam's finger is slightly contracted," meaning "God is always there but the decision is left to man to reach out" [50:54:00]. This relationship may exist with our future selves, and it is up to us to "reach out" [51:07:00].

The decreasing cost of space launches is fundamentally reshaping the space industry, making new ventures economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Historically, high launch costs have limited the scope of space-based operations, but advancements like reusable rockets and [[innovations_in_space_technology_and_exploration | commoditized launch services]] are changing this landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## Driving New Business Models
The reduction in launch costs has created an environment where it's now the best time to start a deeply capital-intensive space company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This is because capital is more accessible, and the fundamental infrastructure costs are declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Companies like [[varda_space_and_their_approach_to_space_manufacturing | Varda Space]] are prime examples, leveraging this new economic reality to pursue [[manufacturing_in_microgravity_environments | space manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

### The Need for Demand
While falling launch costs are beneficial, they alone are not enough to sustain the industry's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. There needs to be an economic driver to ensure continued validation, use, and increased cadence of launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Without this, the industry risks stagnation, similar to past programs like Saturn V or the Space Shuttle, which no longer launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Economic Incentives and Space Settlement
The core mission of [[varda_space_and_their_approach_to_space_manufacturing | Varda Space]] is to expand the economic bounds of humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The belief is that humanity can only become multi-planetary or settle the solar system sustainably through [[economic_incentives_needed_for_space_industry_growth | economic incentives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This is likened to historical events like the California Gold Rush, where economic motivation drove sustained interest and infrastructure development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. [[varda_space_and_their_approach_to_space_manufacturing | Varda]] aims to be the initial step in a "space equivalent gold rush," providing the economic incentive to address very large markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Companies that require frequent launches, such as [[varda_space_and_their_approach_to_space_manufacturing | Varda]], can create the demand necessary to further drive down launch costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Unlike satellite companies that launch once and then operate in orbit, [[varda_space_and_their_approach_to_space_manufacturing | Varda]]'s model of returning products to Earth necessitates a regular launch cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This continuous demand can eventually make other ambitious ventures like lunar ice mining or asteroid mining commercially viable, which are not currently venture-backable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in the Space Market
The space market is projected to reach one trillion dollars by 2030, but this growth is not inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The market can be broadly divided into imaging (government reconnaissance, national security, commercial) and internet services (like Starlink) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. However, these sectors still face challenges, such as the limited size of the imaging market and the speculative unit economics of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) internet due to expensive ground stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

For the space launch market to grow and for costs to continue decreasing, more demand for launch vehicles is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Traditional satellite launches typically don't require subsequent launches once the satellite is in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Companies like [[varda_space_and_their_approach_to_space_manufacturing | Varda]], which profit from repeatedly sending materials into space and returning them, provide the necessary economic impetus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. For a vision like interplanetary colonization to come to fruition, companies like [[varda_space_and_their_approach_to_space_manufacturing | Varda]] are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

## A New Era for Deep Tech Investment
The current macro environment, characterized by significant venture capital and a focus on "atoms over bits" as per the Founders Fund manifesto, allows for more investment in deep tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Companies that demonstrate legitimate progress can raise substantial capital and operate on longer, milestone-based business cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This favorable investment climate further supports the development of capital-intensive ventures in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

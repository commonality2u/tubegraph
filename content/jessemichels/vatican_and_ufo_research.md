The Vatican has a historical and ongoing connection to phenomena often interpreted as UFOs, particularly through the lens of religious and spiritual experiences. Religious studies professor Diana Pula, known for her books *American Cosmic* and *Encounters*, explores these historical parallels and the involvement of the Catholic Church in understanding unexplained aerial phenomena.

## Historical Context and Interpretation
Dr. Diana Pula, a religious studies professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, has conducted extensive research into historical cases of divine or angelic contact reported by Catholic figures such as nuns, priests, brothers, and saints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Her research often involves translating original texts of these experiences, which sometimes differ significantly from official Church interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### St. Francis of Assisi and "UFO" Similarities
One notable case is that of St. Francis of Assisi, a 12th-century Italian friar. The popular narrative describes him seeing Christ under the appearance of a seraph or angel on Mount La Verna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. However, early English translations by Thomas of Celano describe Francis encountering "a sound in Fury," "atmospheric Sparks," and a "flaming torch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Telepathic communication occurred, during which Francis was treated harshly and wounded by "rays of light" that ripped through his hands, later interpreted as Christ's stigmata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Pula notes that these descriptions, including "radiation damage," bear a striking resemblance to modern UFO experiences where people report burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This suggests that phenomena interpreted as divine or angelic contact in the past could be analogous to modern UFO encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>.

### Nuns, Orbs, and Shifting Interpretations
Another example involves Sister Maria, a young nun in the late 1800s, who reported a shining, flame-like object emerging from her cell wall and hovering above her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. The Mother Superior, witnessing the same event, determined it to be a soul stuck in purgatory in need of prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This historical account is directly compared to a 20th-century experience by Melissa, who saw a ball of light move through her apartment, described in John Mack's 1994 book *Abduction* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Pula posits that these two experiences may be the same phenomenon, with differing overlaysâ€”one religious, the other paranormal or extraterrestrial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This highlights how cultural context shapes the interpretation of anomalous events.

## The Vatican Observatory and Space Programs
Diana Pula's book *American Cosmic* details her journey, including an experience with "Tyler," a pseudonym for a mission controller in the Space Force, at the Vatican Observatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

### Tyler's Conversion Experience
Tyler, who had been studying the topic of UFOs but was initially skeptical, didn't consciously understand the full implications of his work in alleged secret space programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. His professional life trajectory was described as "incredibly lucky," receiving ideas for biomedical innovations from a mysterious "machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Pula observed that Tyler followed specific "protocols" that reminded her of religious practices like prayer or meditation, focusing on his biophysical state to "connect" and receive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

At the Vatican, Tyler met Father K, who blessed Pula's "American Cosmic" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. Father K took Pula and Tyler on rounds at a hospital, where they assisted in rights of healing for terminally ill patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. This profoundly impacted Tyler, leading him to reflect on his own life and dedicate himself to helping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

During their visit to the Vatican Observatory, run by a Jesuit monk astronomer, Tyler became deeply moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. The observatory is populated by individuals similar to those in space programs, but who are also deeply religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. International Space Agency people, including young astrophysicists, were also present and recognized Tyler, despite his secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. This convergence of his space background with a profound encounter with Catholic faith and ancient scientific texts (like Copernicus's first editions) led to a conversion experience for Tyler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. He began to interpret the signals he received as being more in line with the experiences of saints he and Pula had been studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

## UFOs and Religious Interpretations
Pula's research suggests that UFOs, often seen as a modern phenomenon, can be understood within a broader historical context of anomalous experiences that societies interpret through their prevailing belief systems. The contemporary "alien" motif, such as "grey aliens" or "flying saucers," may simply be the modern "meme library" through which humans process a timeless, "higher platonic thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:56">[04:00:56]</a>. This aligns with the idea that the "eyes can only see what the mind is prepared to comprehend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The connection between UFOs and religion is profound, merging "nuts and bolts" science with angels, demons, and spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>. Pula asserts that this represents a "new form of religion" that is growing due to its charismatic ability to marry science and spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The intersection of the Vatican, Catholic history, and UFO phenomena reveals a complex narrative where ancient religious experiences and modern UFO sightings may share common underlying phenomena. Diana Pula's work emphasizes the importance of historical context, human interpretation, and the potential for a "re-enchantment of the world" through these experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>. It suggests that the study of UFOs is not just about technology or extraterrestrial life, but also about the enduring human encounter with the unexplained and the evolving nature of belief systems. The [[Involvement of Pope Pius XII and Vatican in UFO retrieval | involvement of Pope Pius XII and Vatican in UFO retrieval]] and [[Mussolini Nazi and Vatican connections with UFOs | Mussolini, Nazi, and Vatican connections with UFOs]] are part of a broader historical and philosophical inquiry into the nature of reality and consciousness itself.

This perspective challenges the "disclosure" narrative as a solely new phenomenon, pointing out that indigenous cultures and ancient traditions have long possessed knowledge and ceremonies related to non-human intelligences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. The focus on "nuts and bolts" in contemporary UFO discourse may distract from the deeper, more profound [[ufos_and_religious_connection | religious connection]] and consciousness-based aspects of the phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>. The [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | religious interpretations of UFOs]] indicate a forcing function that compels individuals to self-examine and confront realities beyond their programmed understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.

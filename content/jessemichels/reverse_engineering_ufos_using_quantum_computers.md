Deep Prasad, a 26-year-old founder, is leading a startup called Quantum Generative Materials with the goal of [[ufo_reverse_engineering_and_crash_retrievals | reverse engineering UFOs]] using [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. His company has raised $15 million for this endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Prasad argues that there are too many global anomalies related to UFOs to ignore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Approach to Reverse Engineering

Since direct access to UFO materials is not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, Prasad's approach relies on data collected by the Pentagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. The Department of Defense (DoD) has hundreds of optical, radar, and infrared detections of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. From these records, the DoD has identified five consistent [[observable_properties_of_ufos_and_new_physics | observable properties]] among UFO sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

### Observable Properties of UFOs

These properties include:
*   Sudden and instantaneous acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>
*   Hypersonic velocity with no signatures (e.g., no sonic boom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>

These observed behaviors, particularly traveling at speeds greater than five times the speed of sound without disturbing the air, suggest that the physics used to describe macroscopic bodies do not apply to these objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. According to Eric Weinstein, a colleague, these properties exhibit "wholly [[observable_properties_of_ufos_and_new_physics | new physics]]," not just new engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Prasad believes these five observables point to UFOs engaging in quantum macroscopic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This implies that Einstein's theories may not be the final word if visitation is taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### Quantum Macroscopic Behavior

Quantum physics typically governs the properties of very small things like atoms, photons, and electrons, which exhibit "spooky" phenomena such as entanglement, tunneling, and wave-particle duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Prasad posits that UFOs could be large, macroscopic quantum objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, essentially more advanced materials whose emergent properties cannot be modeled with current physics and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

An example of macroscopic quantum behavior is superconductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. While the first superconductor was discovered in 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, it took 40 years to understand that it was due to quantum mechanical behavior occurring at the macroscopic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. This applies to low-temperature superconductors; the physics of high-temperature superconductors remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This suggests that when a material "breaks the laws of physics," it's often due to an emergent property of underlying quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Role of [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | Quantum Computers]]

Prasad's initial goal with [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | quantum computing]] was to simulate and predict new materials before they are created in a lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. He aims to determine if a new combination of atoms will be the next semiconductor, solar cell, or battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

To achieve this, [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | quantum computers]] can potentially solve the Schrödinger's many-body equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Solving this equation would reveal everything about a material, including its speed of sound, resonance frequency, heat capacity, and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. However, classical computers can only solve this equation for about three atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>, limiting its usefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Prasad believes that [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | quantum computing]] can overcome this bottleneck and simulate metamaterials that exhibit the five [[observable_properties_of_ufos_and_new_physics | observable properties]] of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

### Quantum Computing Principles

Traditional technology engineers around quantum effects as side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | Quantum computers]], however, leverage these effects by creating and manipulating quantum systems to simulate other quantum systems, as nature itself is quantum mechanical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

The fundamental unit of information in a classical computer is a bit (1 or 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. In a quantum system, it's a qubit, which can exist in a superposition of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. A qubit is not simultaneously 1 and 0, nor is it not-1 and not-0; it's in a superposition state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. This allows for significantly more information storage: 10 qubits require 2 to the power of 10 classical bits to represent their entire quantum state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a> because qubits can be entangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. For example, fully entangled 97 electrons in a caffeine molecule would require 2 to the power of 97 classical bits to describe, which is more atoms than on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. Nature performs this "bookkeeping" effortlessly, leading to ideas like the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | Quantum computers]] simulate nature more accurately, storing more exact information, though the precise mechanism of how they store information remains somewhat of a black box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Current Status

The main bottleneck for building fully functional [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | quantum computers]] is their extreme sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. Qubits rely on maintaining superposition, but they decohere if interfered with by anything from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. This requires specific, energy-intensive environments to maintain coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Due to these challenges, Deep Prasad initially uses a [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | quantum computer]] simulator rather than quantum hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Predictions

Deep Prasad's work and blog explore several philosophical and societal implications:

### Evolution of Science and the Interactive Universe
The modern scientific method, attributed to Sir Francis Bacon, assumes the universe is static and observations are repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. However, anomalies like the Tic-Tac UFO, which are not repeatable, challenge this assumption and suggest that the scientific method needs modification to account for an "interactive universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. Studying anomalies is crucial for the progression of scientific paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.

### Why Some People See UFOs
Prasad offers two answers to why certain people see UFOs, while others do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>:
1.  **Crazy Theory (Cellular Automata):** He speculates that UAP sightings are part of a larger "cellular automata" game or strategy, where individual events contribute to a complex emergent phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>. This "game" could be orchestrated by a more intelligent organism to push society towards a new, complex state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Rational Answer:** Not elaborated upon in this segment.

### Future of UAP Research
Prasad predicts that within the next 10 years, enough scientific and "post-scientific" evidence will be collected to acknowledge that humans are not the only intelligent or super-intelligent life forms on this planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>. This acceptance could lead to a world where religious stories and metaphysical truths merge with scientific understanding, making the world a more "magical" place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>. He emphasizes the naiveté of concluding that everything about the universe is known, especially since current physics describes only 5% of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>.

### Impact of [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | Quantum Computers]] on Society
Prasad believes that within 15 years, [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | quantum computers]] will become powerful enough to render RSA encryption obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>. RSA encryption is the backbone of secure digital communication, including bank accounts and messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>. This development would expose the world's information and make most cryptocurrencies obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>. Such an event would force global cooperation as everyone would lose their leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>.

### AI and Its Evolution
If [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | quantum computers]] didn't exist, Prasad would focus on artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>. He believes AI will become generative, no longer needing human input for its end state, once fundamental machine learning models improve beyond current neural networks and AI has a physical body to interact with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>. He disagrees with near-term doomsday scenarios of sentient killer robots, instead highlighting the more insidious, present danger of AI in consumer apps like TikTok, which subtly manipulate human behavior and can lead to adverse outcomes like increased suicides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>.

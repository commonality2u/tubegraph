Dr. Diana Pasulka, a religious studies professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, explores the deep connections between historical religious experiences and modern UFO phenomena. Her work, particularly the books *American Cosmic* and *Encounters*, has significantly influenced discourse on [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] by suggesting that these phenomena may be a "new form of religion" or a "new religiosity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Historical Parallels and Reinterpretations
Pasulka, with a background in classics and Catholic history, began documenting historical cases of direct divine or angelic contact reported by nuns, priests, brothers, and saints while researching her 2014 book *Heaven Can Wait* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. By conducting her own translations of these accounts, she found striking commonalities with contemporary alien contact experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Saints and Angels vs. Modern Encounters
*   **St. Francis of Assisi**: The popular narrative describes St. Francis seeing Christ as a seraph or angel on Mount La Verna in the 12th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. However, original translations by Thomas of Celano depict Francis encountering a "sound in fury," "atmospheric sparks," and a "flaming torch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Telepathic communication occurred, in which Francis was "treated harshly" and wounded by "rays of light," leading to his wounds being interpreted as Christ's stigmata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Pasulka notes that these descriptions, including "radiation damage," bear strong resemblances to modern [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Angels, Demons, and Aliens**: Pasulka questions if modern "gray aliens" are merely the angels or demons of times past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Similarly, "flying saucers or discs" could be interpreted as the "flaming chariots" or "burning shields or wheels of antiquity," such as those seen by Ezekiel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This perspective suggests that the underlying phenomena might be consistent, but our "overlay" or "meme library" for interpreting them changes with the cultural context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Orb Phenomena**: A 19th-century account describes Sister Maria in a Catholic convent being awakened by a "shining object like a flame" emerging from her wall and hovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. The Mother Superior interpreted it as a soul from purgatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This is compared to a 20th-century account by Melissa in John Mack's *Abduction* (1994), who saw a "ball of light" move through her apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Pasulka posits that these are the "same thing," but one has a religious overlay, and the other is interpreted as paranormal or extraterrestrial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## UFOs as a "New Form of Religion"
Pasulka suggests that [[UFOs and religious connection | UFOs and religious connection]] is leading to a new form of religion because it bridges the gap between scientific understanding and spiritual belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This perspective acknowledges both the "nuts and bolts" (physical craft) and the "angels and demons" (spiritual/metaphysical) aspects of the phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:39">[21:37:39]</a>.

### The Forcing Function and Personal Transformation
For Pasulka, the UFO phenomenon acts as a "forcing function" that compels individuals to re-evaluate their lives and "go on the straight and narrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:12">[26:12:12]</a>. Encounters can be transformative, leading to increased sensitivity to reality and a commitment to personal "salvation" in a human sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>. This echoes historical religious accounts where contact experiences led to profound changes in individuals, such as St. Francis of Assisi's life becoming one of hardship and spiritual growth after his encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:43:00">[27:43:00]</a>.

The idea of "purity" or preparedness for contact is also explored, drawing parallels to traditions like the Merkabah tradition in Judaism or Socratic philosophy, where specific disciplines or intellectual purification were required to access higher knowledge or truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. However, Pasulka cautions against actively seeking such contact, describing it as potentially dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>.

## [[UFOs and Human Consciousness | Consciousness]] and the Space Program
Pasulka's research connects UFO phenomena to [[UFOs and Human Consciousness | human consciousness]], particularly through her interactions with a pseudonymous NASA mission controller named Tyler. Tyler reportedly used specific protocols to mentally download information for biotech innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. These protocols, including sufficient sleep and hydration, aimed to prepare his "biophysical self" to connect with signals that provided information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

### Vatican Observatory and Tyler's Conversion
A significant moment in Pasulka's book *American Cosmic* is Tyler's visit to the Vatican Observatory. During this visit, surrounded by Catholic astronomers who integrated their faith with scientific pursuits, Tyler had a profound "conversion experience," realizing the deep meaning of his work and dedicating himself to helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>. This convergence of Catholic faith and space exploration highlights the potential for the [[the_merging_of_science_and_spirituality_through_ufo_phenomena | merging of science and spirituality]] within the UFO discourse.

### Mysticism in Space Exploration
Historically, figures involved in space programs have shown connections to mystical or spiritual beliefs. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a father of Russian rocketry, constructed a "cosmic religion" around space, including beliefs in human immortality, colonization of the Milky Way, and time travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:36:00">[55:36:00]</a>. His American counterpart, Jack Parsons, involved in early rocketry, famously stated, "science is a form of magic and not vice versa" after reading *The Golden Bough* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. These historical links suggest that the development of space technology has been intertwined with spiritual or esoteric understandings. Pasulka's research also revealed that specific iconography, including Greek goddesses and Roman Empire Latin, were used in NASA launches, suggesting a parallel, perhaps unrecognized, religious dimension to the space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Challenging the "Nuts and Bolts" Narrative
Pasulka argues that the prevailing focus on "nuts and bolts" explanations for [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] can distract from the deeper [[UFOs and Human Consciousness | consciousness-based]] and parapsychological aspects of the phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. She criticizes the concept of "disclosure" as a "colonial concept" that assumes Western governments hold all knowledge, ignoring centuries of indigenous and non-Western understanding and experience with these phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>.

### From Skepticism to Encounter
Pasulka's own journey from an "analytical, rigorous academic" who was initially skeptical of [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] to someone who has experienced anomalies herself illustrates the transformative nature of engaging with this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. She emphasizes that while media and popular culture can influence how people describe their experiences (e.g., Betty and Barney Hill's alien descriptions influenced by *Outer Limits* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> or the *2001 Space Odyssey* monolith as a potential "digital screen" manipulating reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>), a genuine phenomenon also exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The existence of both "scoops" (psychological operations) and a real phenomenon is a "both/and" situation, making the topic complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## [[Philosophy and modern UFO discourse | Philosophy]] and the Re-enchantment of the World
The [[Philosophy and modern UFO discourse | UFO discourse]] prompts an epistemological paradigm shift, challenging the modern secularized worldview. Pasulka references the concept of the "invisible College" (a term with Rosicrucian roots) that sought to "marry the science and the spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

She cites French [[Philosophy and modern UFO discourse | philosopher]] Jacques Vallée, who suggested that UFOs act as control systems using intermittent reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Vallée's interest in Fallen Angels and Demons further emphasizes the non-terrestrial and possibly spiritual nature of these control systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Pasulka and Vallée both suggest that the UFO phenomenon, by physically manifesting what should only exist in the "spirit world," shatters the Western materialistic worldview, leading to a "re-enchantment of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>. This challenges the "cold scientific paradigm" that has dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>.

### The Role of AI and the Future
Pasulka’s friend Simone believes that the advent of AI signals a new "revelation," which could redistribute power and serve as a definitive revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>. The perception of AI, whether as sentient or merely statistical, has significant sociological repercussions, much like the belief in [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>. The phenomenon forces a form of self-examination, moving individuals out of established "programs" or belief systems to confront deeper realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.

Dr. Gary Nolan, a microbiologist and geneticist at Stanford, is deeply interested in the subject of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), also known as UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A distinguishing factor for Dr. Nolan is his claim to possess what may be UAP parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## CIA Approach to Dr. Nolan

Just a few years ago, the [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | CIA]] approached Dr. Nolan for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Nolan initially believed it to be a joke, looking for a camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The agency stated they had "asked around" and determined that Nolan had "built the best tool called scitov" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The agency's primary interest was to determine if individuals who reported UFO contact exhibited any neurological and physiological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This initiative highlights [[the_role_of_military_and_intelligence_agencies_in_ufo_investigations | military and intelligence agency involvement in UFO investigations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### "Invisible College" and MRI Analysis

Nolan was introduced to a group of individuals he referred to as the "invisible college," including [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Jacques Vallee]], [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Hal Puthoff]], Eric Davis, [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Robert Bigelow]], and Colm Kelleher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Many of these individuals had claimed interactions with UFOs and were described as "Department of Defense and intelligence people," considered "reasonably credible individuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | CIA]] provided Nolan with MRIs of some of these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Upon examining the MRIs, Nolan observed a specific area of the brain that appeared "disturbed or different" in many subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This area, located between the head of the caudate and the putamen, showed increased neural density and was larger in these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

These individuals were also described as "highly functioning" and capable of making "snap decisions," suggesting a strong intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Notably, family members of these individuals also possessed this unique brain structure, indicating a potential genetic component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Nolan postulates that this structural difference might enable individuals to "see" or "recognize" UAPs and avoid dismissing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Theories on Perception and Reality

Nolan suggests that human senses act as a filter, limiting perception to prevent the brain from being overwhelmed by reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. He is sympathetic to the model that sensory organs are reductive rather than productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This brain area might allow for better interpretation of phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Research into this brain region includes studies on Japanese chess masters, where the caudate and putamen showed activity during intuitive, brilliant moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Nolan's lab is also studying this area in individuals with autism and schizophrenia, as it can be damaged in these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. He notes that schizophrenics perceive and hear things others do not, raising questions about whether they are "crazy" or simply unable to "turn off" a "transmitter" of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

This [[strategic_dynamics_surrounding_ufo_disclosure_and_government_involvement | government interest]] and Nolan's work underline the ongoing [[role_of_military_and_government_in_ufo_secrecy | debate and investigation into UFO phenomena]] and their potential implications.

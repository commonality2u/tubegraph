Remote viewing is a practice that involves organizing one's perceptual experiences and consciousness to access and perceive locations, persons, and objects that are not directly accessible through conventional senses or memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:06">[03:26:06]</a>. This ability challenges the classic understanding of consciousness, which is often believed to be limited by the five senses and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:50">[03:48:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:11">[03:50:11]</a>.

## Origins of Remote Viewing

The concept of [[remote_viewing_and_parapsychology | remote viewing]] gaining structured attention began in 1972 when laser physicist Hal Puthoff conducted experiments with New York City-based psychic Ingo Swann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:07">[05:42:07]</a>. Swann, who had experienced out-of-body phenomena since childhood, believed this ability could be developed into a rigorous protocol for viewing distant objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. His accurate remote viewing of readouts on a highly shielded cork detector captured the attention of high-ranking officials in the defense department, leading to the initiation of the [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate Project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

## The [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate Project]]

The [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate Project]] was a [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_spying | psychic spy]] program run by the CIA from 1972 to 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Its objective was to use remote viewers, essentially psychics, to gather intelligence, such as locating Russian nuclear bases and missing American hostages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. The program had notable successes early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate Project]] was officially declassified in 2017, and its files are available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Notable Successes

### Joe McMoneagle and the Typhoon Submarine
Joe McMoneagle, widely known as "Remote Viewer Number One," demonstrated astonishing accuracy in his sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. In 1979, he was tasked with remote viewing a seemingly impenetrable building in a Russian shipyard off the White Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. McMoneagle described a massive nuclear submarine under construction, specifically noting its ballistic missile tubes were positioned in front of the sail (superstructure), a design feature unheard of at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. His description was initially dismissed as crazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. However, eight months later, Russia publicly revealed the Typhoon, the largest submarine ever built, which indeed had its missile tubes in front of the superstructure, exactly as McMoneagle had described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

### Rosemary Smith and the Downed Spy Plane
In the same year, 1979, Rosemary Smith helped locate a downed Tu-22 spy plane in Zaire, which contained highly sensitive Russian cryptographic equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Both American and Russian forces were searching for it, but satellite imagery was insufficient to penetrate the triple-canopy forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Dale Graf, a [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate]] lead, gave Smith a map of the entire African continent and a picture of the plane, asking her to find its crash site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. She identified a three-square-mile area on the map, within which the plane was subsequently found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. President Jimmy Carter later recalled being shocked by the accuracy of the psychic medium who channeled the plane's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

### Paul Smith and the USS Stark Incident
Paul Smith, another remote viewer involved in the [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate Project]], had several successes of his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. In 1987, during the Iran-Iraq War, he was tasked with describing what was most important to know within the next few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. Smith described an American destroyer-like vessel being approached by an aircraft that dropped two "little cylinders with stubby wings" making roaring sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. These objects eventually struck the vessel, which then became "full of smoke and flames" and "bent and crumpled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. Days later, Smith learned from the Washington Post that the USS Stark had been hit by Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi jet, precisely matching his remote viewing description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. This information, if acted upon, could have potentially saved 37 American lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Context

Despite these successes, integrating [[remote_viewing_and_parapsychology | parapsychology]] into mainstream science presents challenges. The ability to perceive things at a distance, unexplainable by physicalism, suggests that a "transmission concept of consciousness" is more plausible than a brain-localized model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. However, [[remote_viewing_and_parapsychology | extrasensory perception (ESP)]] is difficult to explain within the current physicalist paradigm, which leads to its exclusion from mainstream acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. Skeptics, though a minority, control major publication organs, often suppressing competing worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

## Remote Viewing Techniques

Training for remote viewing involves recognizing a very subtle signal that is not yet fully understood where it originates from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. A key aspect of training is learning to identify and disregard "mental noise" or "analytical overlay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. This happens when the left brain attempts to interpret or solve the problem based on incomplete impressions, leading to false conclusions (e.g., mistaking crisscrossing metal girders for a bridge instead of the Eiffel Tower) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. Joe McMoneagle famously stated he would "send his ego off to do something else" during sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. This highlights a "zen component" where the focus must be on the process rather than the outcome, requiring the viewer to not care whether they succeed or fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

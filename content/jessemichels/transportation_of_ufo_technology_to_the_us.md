The Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, was reportedly in charge of the initial custody of UFO technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Magenta Crash in Lombardy, Italy

According to David Grusch, a [[UFO crash retrieval | magenta crash]] occurred in Lombardy, Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. James Jesus Angleton, an OSS operative, was involved in Italy at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Following the crash, Benito Mussolini reportedly contacted Adolf Hitler to inquire if the technology belonged to the Nazis, leading to their collaborative involvement with the retrieved material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Transfer to the US

A consistent narrative suggests that after the Lombardy magenta crash and the Nazis' involvement, the Vatican, specifically Pope Pius XII, played a role in back-channeling the technology through the OSS, ultimately transferring it to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Once in the US, the technology was reportedly worked on at Wright Airfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Influx of Nazi Scientists

The urgency to acquire Nazi scientists, particularly those deeply involved in exotic flight principles and [[UFO Physics and Advanced Technologies | UFO technology]], was part of the effort to study this retrieved material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Hans Kammler, who was in charge of highly classified VFA programs for the Nazis, is known to have made his way to the US, reinforcing this narrative of early [[UFO crash retrieval | UFO crash]] involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

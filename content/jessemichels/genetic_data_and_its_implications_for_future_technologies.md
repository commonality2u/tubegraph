Genetic data and its applications are rapidly advancing, presenting both opportunities for medical breakthroughs and complex [[emerging_technologies_and_their_ethical_implications | ethical implications]]. Companies like Lux Capital, a venture capital firm, actively invest in [[biotech_industry_advances_and_investments | hard science and tech]] that push the boundaries of what is possible, often inspired by science fiction concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Variant Bio: Unlocking Outlier Traits

Lux Capital's investment in Variant Bio exemplifies their approach to leveraging genetic data for future technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The company's work is inspired by the idea of identifying rare human phenotypes, akin to Professor X using Cerebro to find mutants in the X-Men franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### The Problem with Existing Genetic Data
Historically, most genetic sequencing efforts, including those by companies like 23andMe, Roche, and Genentech, have focused primarily on Europeans in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, the most interesting outlier traits are often found in remote, often uncontacted, island populations where individuals are genetically homogeneous or interrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Variant Bio's Approach
Variant Bio seeks out genetically homogeneous societies that have been largely uncontacted by the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Within these populations, they identify individuals with extraordinary "phenotypic traits," such as:
*   Incredible lung capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>
*   Exceptional upper body strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>
*   Resistance to particular diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>
*   High metabolic rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>

Due to the genetic homogeneity of these communities, it becomes easier to pinpoint the specific genes responsible for these traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The ultimate goal is to translate these genetic discoveries into new gene therapies. For example, understanding a high metabolic rate found in a cold environment could lead to a druggable target for obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This process involves taking insights from outlier individuals in outlier regions and applying them to the broader population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Future of Genetic Technologies

As more genetic data (GWAS data) is accumulated and the correlation between phenotypes and genotypes becomes clearer, the capabilities for [[biological_evolution_and_future_humans | human genetic manipulation]] and selection are expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

### Gradual Acceptance of Genetic Intervention
Many advancements in this field happen gradually, becoming commonplace over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. For instance, the idea of having six people involved in making a baby or the concept of surrogacy would have seemed "crazy" 50 years ago, but are now accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

### Current Applications and Ethical Considerations
Today, genetic testing is routinely performed during pregnancy to screen for potential afflictions, allowing parents to make ethical decisions about the pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This ability to screen for genetic abnormalities with increasing resolution highlights the growing power of genetic technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

### Embryo Selection and Gene Editing
The ability to perform gene selection is already present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Technologies like CRISPR enable gene editing to remove harmful mutations, which individuals may elect to do, creating significant societal debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. For example, China has conducted experiments using CRISPR to genetically modify dogs for hyper-muscularity, and there are rumors of attempts to create "super soldiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This indicates a "wild west" in genetics, necessitating careful consideration of [[emerging_technologies_and_their_ethical_implications | ethical concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

### Gametogenesis
The concept of gametogenesis, where a cell from the skin can be molecularly "rinsed" and turned into a primordial stem cell-like cell to synthetically create gametes, is a "totally wild" prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. This process could allow for thousands of genetic variations to be created outside the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. While this offers the potential to engineer gametes to be protective against pathogens, it also raises profound questions about "playing God," similar to how humans have manipulated plants since the agricultural revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

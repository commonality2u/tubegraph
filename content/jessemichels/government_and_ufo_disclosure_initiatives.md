For thousands of years, people have observed unidentified objects in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For approximately the last 80 years, speculation has surrounded the involvement of the American and other governments with [[ufos_and_government_disclosure | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. This article details firsthand accounts and insights into covert government programs, retrieval operations of non-human technology, and the complex landscape of [[ufo_disclosure_and_government_reports | UFO disclosure]].

## Early Government Involvement and Secrecy

The U.S. Air Force was established in 1947, just two weeks after the Roswell incident, coinciding with the National Security Act, the formation of the CIA, and the Department of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>. Since its inception, the Air Force has "straddled the blue-black line," representing the division between the public "white world" (open source) and the highly cleared, sensitive "black world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The black world is described as a four-dimensional projection into a three-dimensional world, where much of what is seen is connected through another dimension that people are not paying attention to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

The speaker, a first-hand witness to UFO retrieval, was recruited in 1994 into a new Air Force program called GP (guaranteed training education program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This 10-year contract fast-tracked him through Special Operations training as a combat control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>. His recruitment process was unique, involving physiological and psychological testing, including a stress IQ test where he scored higher under stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>. His initial role as an airplane mechanic served as a cover for his true specialization as a "red team expert," an opposition force tasked with exploiting weaknesses in military strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Deception, a core tenet of warfare, was central to his training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Witness Accounts and Retrieval Operations

The witness was involved in security and escort of "high-value targets" (HVTs), often sealed "mystery containers" of various sizes transported by classified flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### The "Egg" Retrieval

Post-9/11, the speaker began working as a contractor for the broader intelligence community, focusing on aeronautical operations, especially helicopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. His civilian roles, such as Director of Operations for a helicopter company, served as legitimate covers for his program missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

He recounts recovering a "giant white egg," approximately 20 feet long and spherical, on a California desert range used for testing weapons and experimental craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The object was unexpected by his leadership and team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. As a helicopter pilot, he transported the egg via a long line, observing its pearly white, asymmetrical surface through night vision goggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the experience was "so real" it didn't register as exciting at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

His conviction that it was [[ufo_disclosure_and_government_reports | non-human intelligence]] (NHI) stems from three reasons:
1.  **Unanticipated Nature**: It was not an expected test object, and the team, experts in advanced U.S. government tech, had no protocol for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
2.  **Official Confirmation**: Ranking members of the UAP Task Force later confirmed it was NHI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
3.  **Repeatable Summoning**: Since leaving the program and reorganizing with ARO (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office), his team, Skywatcher Technologies, has been able to "make the egg show up" in broad daylight, moving at 10,000 mph in dead silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This repeatable nature is presented as key to scientific validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

### The "Eight-gon" Retrieval and Biological Exposure

During another mission, the witness recovered an "eight-gon" craft—a dark matte gray or black disc, about 25-30 feet in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This craft included a "Hazmat disclosure for biologics," indicating non-human life forms, though the witness initially assumed it was human remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

During this retrieval, the witness experienced an overwhelming emotional escalation, a "beautiful but sad" feminine energy that disrupted his ability to fly and caused him to cry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This phenomenon was unlike any stress he had encountered, suggesting an interference with his consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This experience, along with subsequent ones, caused him to suffer from a heart murmur, full body hair loss, skin peeling, rashes, and autoimmune disorders, which Dr. Gary Nolan (Stanford microbiologist and Nobel nominee) suggests are consistent with other UFO experiencers, such as John Burroughs of the Rendlesham Forest incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The lack of proper Hazmat protocols at the time indicates the Air Force may not have understood the nature of what they were dealing with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Psionic Assets and Summoning

The military has utilized "psionic assets," individuals trained in remote viewing, psychic abilities, and telekinesis, to collect data and even summon UAP activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. These assets are capable of tapping into a "consciousness field" through practices like mindful meditation, enhancing intuition while subduing intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Stress Inoculation**: Triggering fight-or-flight responses to heighten intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Disassociation**: Chemical means or meditation to subdue intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Hardware**: Non-intrusive ultrasound systems can target the brain to aid in this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This is tested using random number generators, where even minuscule deviations from randomness indicate a subject's ability to affect reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

Two types of summoning are proven to work:
1.  **Machine-based systems**: Involve signals and energy systems that attract UAP activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Man-based systems**: Utilize psionic assets. These assets are "highly coveted" and often prospected in third-world countries, where individuals living simpler lives may be more adept at disassociating and heightening intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The speaker clarified that this is not "human trafficking" in the sense of slavery, as individuals typically participate willingly due to economic disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Lack of Centralized Control and Private Contractors

The witness highlights a significant problem within the "Legacy [[ufo_disclosure_and_secrecy | UFO program]]": a lack of clear chain of command and central authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. He states that the U.S. government "lost control of it a long time ago," with private aerospace contractors holding significant power and real estate in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

This compartmentalization means that even activities of operators on the ground may not be known in Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The system allows for plausible deniability, severing the connection to the "hidden hand" of these operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Disclosure and Whistleblowers

The speaker's group, Skywatcher Technologies, now operates as a private venture, utilizing the tools and talents from their former government roles to explore UAP phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. They have provided their data and reports to ARO and Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

The speaker's own journey began as a "red teamer" sent to identify whistleblowers for the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. However, hearing Michael Herrera's testimony about an "eight-gon" craft and the associated paramilitary units (which Michael speculated were for human trafficking but the speaker believes were for transferring psionic assets) led him to switch from "red teaming" to "black teaming"—working against the secretive aspects of the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Sean Kirkpatrick of ARO has denied Herrera's report publicly, but allegedly admitted its truth to members of the Senate Intelligence Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

The speaker explains that he is not afraid of being silenced by death because those with the "will and skill" to do so haven't, and he is now protected by "more good guys" within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. He acknowledges that some individuals who have spoken out on these activities have died under suspicious circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### The DOSR Process

The speaker reveals his team's method for navigating the Department of Defense's prepublication and security review (DOSR) process. They wrote a "faction" (fact and fiction mixture) manuscript, submitting it in pieces to DOSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Their goal was to "red team the DOSR process" to identify subject matter experts and map out who controlled what information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

They included four categories of information:
1.  **Clearly Classified Information**: Expected to be redacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Need-to-know Classified Information**: Only known by operators, testing the specificity of the review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Open-Source Classified Information**: Already leaked online, testing official response to its "re-release" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
4.  **Complete Fictional Liberty**: Speculations to probe for classified information that might be inadvertently confirmed by redaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

Seven pages of redactions were returned across all four categories, confirming their method's effectiveness. The DOSR process creates a dilemma: redacting validates the information, while not redacting makes it open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. A strategy used by some is to intentionally allow classified information to be released under the guise of fiction, thereby "internally sealing it with the stamp of the creative writings of a fictional author" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This is seen as one of the government's only ways to disclose information due to extreme compartmentalization and lack of centralized knowledge within the DOD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Political Figures and UFO Disclosure

### The Clintons

The speaker's experiences during the Clinton era were influenced by the Clintons' interest in the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Hillary Clinton, shown with a book titled "Are We Alone?" and John Podesta, her chief of staff, have been proponents of disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The standing up of AATIP (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program) and the subsequent New York Times article in 2017 are seen as correlated with Hillary's presidential run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### John F. Kennedy

The **JFK assassination** is perceived to have ties to the UAP topic. The timeline of government reaction to UAP events in the 1940s-1960s, including anomalous material from a nuclear test (Bluegill Triple Prime) taken to Los Alamos and JFK's subsequent interest in UAPs, suggests a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. A controversial letter from JFK to CIA director John McCone, discussing coordination with Soviets on UFOs, further links his assassination to the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### Trump and Future Disclosure

Donald Trump has promised a "whole new era of disclosure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Potential figures like Tulsi Gabbard as DNI or Kash Patel as FBI Director are seen as encouraging by the speaker for their motivation to share information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Implications and Future Outlook

The speaker believes that the phenomenon is both benevolent and malevolent, mirroring humanity's capacity for good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. He cautions against naiveté regarding potentially dominant or technologically advanced life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. While acknowledging the value of military custody over this knowledge, he also stresses the need for more humane approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

The "hitchhiker effect," where anomalous phenomena follow individuals home, is real for the speaker, with his family witnessing UAPs like a blue, winged "angel" over their house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. He encourages individuals to seek answers by looking inward and upward, suggesting that even simple acts like prayer can elicit phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

The dichotomy between inner and outer space might be a false one, suggesting a future science that is more spiritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. The speaker, with Skywatcher Technologies, plans a public demonstration in the first half of 2025, hoping to bring a craft to the ground legally and in coordination with government partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This, he hopes, will shift the current "ontological shock" into "ontological relief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, fostering a broader understanding and encouraging participation from all sectors of society.

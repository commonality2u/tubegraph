A "non-human craft" was reportedly retrieved, described as an "egg" due to its shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This object was considered extraordinary and surprising to everyone involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Retrieval Operation

The recovery operation involved a [[Helicopter transport in UFO retrieval | helicopter transport in UFO retrieval]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A helicopter pilot's role was to transport the object using a 150-foot long line suspended below the helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This line had a remote hook that could attach to hardware securing the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The pilot directly observed the object, describing it as approximately 20 feet long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The transport occurred at night, with sufficient lunar illumination for the pilot to see it with the naked eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Ground personnel wrapped nets around the object to secure it for transport, implying they made physical contact with the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

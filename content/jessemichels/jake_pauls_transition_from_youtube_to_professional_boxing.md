[[jake_pauls_influence_on_the_sport_of_boxing_and_its_business_model | Jake Paul]], an internet sensation, has undergone a significant transformation to become a professional boxer, a journey that has revitalized the sport and challenged traditional models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Early Career and Tech Ventures

Before his boxing career, Paul was known as a YouTube star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Host Jesse Michaels first met Paul when he was 17 years old, seeking tech advice, which led to Paul staying at Michaels' apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Paul also starred in the Disney Channel show *Bizaardvark* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, where he earned approximately $10,000 per episode, working 12 hours a day, six days a week, while also creating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## Embracing Authenticity and Building a Brand

An inflection point occurred when Paul decided to build his own brand and leverage, moving away from traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This decision coincided with him embracing the "villain" persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. His departure from Disney was a mutual decision, influenced by the "problems" he was causing for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Paul observed that individuals who are authentic and aren't afraid to be themselves, like Kanye and Trump, tend to succeed on the internet, especially as "cancel culture" began to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. He believes that authenticity is key, and people are only "canceled" if they give up or are genuinely doing something wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This approach highlights [[jake_pauls_approach_to_brand_building_and_authenticity | Jake Paul's approach to brand building and authenticity]].

Paul also runs Anti-Fund with Jeff Wu, a venture capital firm, where he is actively involved in calls and diligence, showing a commitment to the "trenches" of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. He looks for founders who are hungry, willing to work, and adaptable to change, often possessing a clear vision of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## Transition to Professional Boxing

Paul's transition to boxing provided an outlet for him to "redeem" himself and work towards a new goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Despite initial skepticism, his work ethic and excellent coaches have been crucial to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. He views the villain role as essential for going "further in this sport," stemming from his authentic personality as a "class clown" who enjoys ruffling feathers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Social Media and Impact on Fighter Pay

Paul is adept at using [[the_impact_of_social_media_on_the_fight_industry | social media]] to his advantage, seeing it as his "territory" in beefs with MMA fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. He believes [[the_impact_of_social_media_on_the_fight_industry | social media]] is changing the fight game, giving power back to fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

Paul has also been outspoken about the issue of [[challenges_and_insights_into_fighter_pay_and_training_expenses | fighter pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. He notes that fighters often do not realize how expensive it is to run a training camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>, and his platform helps expose the underpayment of fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. He advocates for every fighter to view themselves as a "media company" and a "brand" to increase their worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

Jonah Hill made a Netflix documentary about Phil Stuts called "Stuts" approximately a year prior to this interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The documentary has received significant acclaim and has "blown things up," leading to a surge of calls for therapy and inquiries about Phil Stuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, which have since calmed down to about 7 to 10 calls per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Introduction to Phil Stuts

Phil Stuts is described as the interviewer's godfather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. He possesses an "almost Clairvoyant ability" to instantaneously size people up, identify their blockages, and offer practical routes forward in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Professional Background and Influence

Before his current practice, Phil Stuts served as the Riker's Island prison psychiatrist for five years, where evaluating and helping individuals was often a matter of life or death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. In his early 30s, he was afflicted with chronic fatigue syndrome, a condition causing extreme and constant exhaustion that made it difficult for him to get out of bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This personal breakdown, however, was "bizarrely generative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

During this period, Stuts discovered a turn-of-the-century Austrian philosopher, [[Rudolph Steiners Philosophy and Influence | Rudolph Steiner]], whose worldview and practice came to define his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Stuts began attracting impressive individuals as patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, including CEOs of billion-dollar companies, actors, producers, and directors, some of whom were on the verge of self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Much of this is detailed in a *New Yorker* profile about him titled "Hollywood Shadows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Tools and Philosophy

Phil Stuts's long-time business partner, Barry Michaels (the interviewer's father), helped develop and communicate Stuts's ideas to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Together, they authored *The Tools*, a *New York Times* best-selling book, and its follow-up, *Coming Alive* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Their practice emphasizes mental visualizations for facing daunting everyday situations, incorporating archetypal Jungian symbology, unlike traditional cognitive behavioral therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Despite potentially appearing "wacky or insane," their methods "empirically seems to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

[!INFO] Phil Stuts's core philosophy for patient interaction is ensuring they leave every session with "marching orders" and a clear action plan for the week, whether it involves external tasks or internal "Shadow" work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. He believes it is crucial to give patients something tangible or conceptual to walk away with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.

### The Shadow

Working with one's "Shadow" is considered the most ubiquitously applicable and powerful tool Stuts and Michaels have developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. The Shadow refers to the unwanted, inferior, or shameful side of one's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. Establishing a regular, daily relationship with the Shadow, by "talking to it" and allowing it to "talk back," can reveal unknown insights and lead to unpredictable but exciting personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] A notable example of the Shadow's utility is when Stuts used it during a session with an uncommunicative accountant patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. His Shadow told him to "look at his eyes," revealing a vision of a tear, which prompted Stuts to comment on an "immense sadness," causing the patient to burst into tears and open up completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

### Integration of Tools

While tools like "reversal of desire" help individuals take action and achieve external outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, Shadow work is crucial to prevent the Shadow from revolting against an overly rigid taskmaster approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. The Shadow can advise when to ease up and appreciate life's simple pleasures, enabling a more holistic approach to self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

### Views on Traditional Therapy

Stuts and Michaels acknowledge both positives and negatives of traditional therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. They believe the most common problem with talk therapy is that it is often "masturbatory," lacking articulated goals or a roadmap to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. They contrast this with their outcome-oriented approach, where patients have clear tasks after each session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

They criticize the "monetization of anything" that "sucks the soul out of it" by making it generic and scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. This applies to the modern medical system, which views healing as an "interoperable" protocol rather than an "idiosyncratic one-to-one process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. They view this as "evil" because it reduces the practitioner to a "cog in a machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Current Status

Both Phil Stuts and Barry Michaels are currently facing "not super fun health challenges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This episode serves as a celebration of their work and legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

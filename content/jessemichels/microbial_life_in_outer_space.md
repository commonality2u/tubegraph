The argument that life is uncommon lacks supporting evidence, with observations suggesting the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This includes the resilience of microbial life and its apparent ability to survive in extreme environments.

## Resilience and Early Evolution

Microbes have demonstrated viability in outer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Recent findings include the identification of microbes that had been in stasis within two billion-year-old terrestrial rock and were successfully revived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This points to the robust nature of microbial life.

Furthermore, evidence from Earth suggests that life evolved at the earliest possible time, offering [[evidence_against_the_unlikelihood_of_life | evidence against the unlikelihood of life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>:
*   Fossilized blue-green algae found in stromatolites date back 3.5 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Recent scholarship indicates that life may have evolved even earlier, approximately 4.1 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Considering Earth is approximately 5 billion years old and its crust had not yet cooled by 4.1 billion years ago, this implies the [[possibility_of_life_at_early_stages_of_earths_history | possibility of life at early stages of Earth's history]], earlier than might be reasonably expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Implications for Panspermia

The rapid evolution of life on Earth and the viability of microbes in outer space suggest two main possibilities for the prevalence of life: either life evolves very quickly, or some form of [[panspermia_theory | panspermia theory]] is at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. All available evidence tends to support these suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Private aerospace companies hold significant power and "real estate" in the domain of [[ufos_and_government_secrecy | UFO secrecy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>. The U.S. government effectively "lost control" of this information and related activities a long time ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:08">[01:31:08]</a>.

## Reasons for Private Involvement

One primary reason for involving prime aerospace contractors is to ensure greater safety and insulation for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:49">[01:31:49]</a>. This approach leverages a "hidden hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>, providing plausible deniability to those at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>. This has created a "structural overhang" of Cold War secrecy that is now anachronistic and no longer makes sense from a national defense standpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>.

## Operations and Secrecy

The compartmentalized nature of these operations means that even within the system, individuals' daily activities are not widely known at higher administrative levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. The overall structure is described as a "gangly octopus" rather than a well-organized model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:12">[01:50:12]</a>. The fact that the primary rule for trained operators is "deception" further complicates oversight and understanding within these organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:34">[01:50:34]</a>.

There are multiple programs and coverups happening simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>, contributing to the overall confusion and lack of synergy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:27">[01:49:27]</a>.

## Consequences of Secrecy

*   **Compromised Safety**: The lack of coordination and oversight among various entities, including private partners, leads to significant safety risks, particularly in shared airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:29">[02:26:29]</a>.
*   **Lack of Accountability**: When [[government_involvement_and_secrecy_regarding_uap_technology | government involvement and secrecy regarding UAP technology]] is outsourced to private entities, it becomes difficult to establish a clear chain of command or central authority for accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>.
*   **Criminal Activity**: There have been allegations of criminal activity within these programs, particularly concerning the handling of [[ufo_disclosure_and_secrecy | crash retrievals]] and sensitive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:08">[01:41:08]</a>. Individuals who attempt to expose this activity face severe risks, including death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **"Truth in Plain Sight"**: The Department of Defense (DoD) prepublication and security review (DoDASER) process can unintentionally validate classified information when authors submit "historical fiction" manuscripts containing factual claims. By redacting specific details, the DoD indirectly confirms their sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>. This allows some truth to exist in the public domain under the guise of fiction, a common strategy to hide information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:03">[02:09:03]</a>.

## Global Landscape

Beyond the U.S. government, there are global crash recovery and reverse engineering programs run by "hybrid organizations" that are extra-governmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:26">[02:14:26]</a>. These entities independently invest time and money into understanding and utilizing UAP phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:16">[02:14:16]</a>.

The concept of [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time travel]] is frequently linked with the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), particularly through the hypothesis that "aliens" are, in fact, humans from the future who have mastered [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time travel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

## The Future Human Hypothesis

Dr. Michael P. Masters, a biological anthropologist and professor at Montana Tech University, has developed a theoretical framework suggesting that "aliens" are humans from the future who have figured out [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time travel]] and are visiting the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. This idea is explored in his books, *Identified Flying Objects*, *The Extratempestrial Model*, and *Revelation: The Future Human Past* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.

### Evolutionary Convergence

The physical characteristics often ascribed to "grey aliens" align with predictions of human evolution:
*   **Eyes**: Their eyes are described as slits, which could result from increased screen time in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.
*   **Noses and Ears**: Grey aliens typically have very small noses and ears, reflecting a diminished importance of senses like smell and hearing compared to hunter-gatherer times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>.
*   **Child-like Appearance**: They are often described as child-like and around 3 feet tall, which aligns with the evolutionary concept of neoteny, where distant descendants resemble current children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:28">[01:30:28]</a>.

This hypothesis addresses the improbability of life on another planet evolving to look almost exactly like humans, speak our languages, and breathe our air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:19">[09:23:19]</a>.

### Proponents of the Hypothesis

Several credentialed [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | UFO]] researchers and figures support the [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time travel]] hypothesis:
*   **Navy Commander George Hoover**: Admitted that beings from the Roswell crash were "just [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time traveling]] humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.
*   **Hermann Oberth**: The "father of German rocketry" and Wernher von Braun's mentor, stated that [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | UFOs]] likely "don't traverse large distances in space, they jump from one [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time space coordinate]] to another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:07">[02:03:07]</a>.
*   **Steven Spielberg**: Allegedly told Deadpool Creator Robert Liefield in 1993, "What's easier to believe, that we are being monitored by aliens from another world or that we are monitoring ourselves and studying us from the future?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. Spielberg also included hints of [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time travel]] in *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, with unaged World War II pilots appearing at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>.
*   **Tom DeLonge**: Blink-182 frontman and To The Stars Academy founder, suggested that [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | UFOs]] "aren't coming from other planets, these things might be coming through time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>.
*   **Paul Hynek**: Son of J. Allen Hynek, questioned why "aliens" would find us and care about Earth, concluding it's because "we're their ancestors" and they are "set to inherit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:32">[02:57:32]</a>.

## UFOs as Time Machines

Many believe the [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | UFOs]] themselves are [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time machines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>.
*   **Form Follows Function**: The saucer-shaped or disk-shaped craft have a form consistent with the function of manipulating space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>. This aligns with physicist Frank Tipler's work, which built upon Einstein's field equations, showing that a rapidly rotating ring, sphere, or disk could bend light cones to allow movement into the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:59">[20:09:59]</a>.
*   **Electromagnetism**: Strong electromagnetism is often reported around these craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:57">[03:14:57]</a>. This makes sense if they are [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time machines]], as creating a traversable wormhole for [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time travel]] would generate significant electromagnetic fallout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:20">[17:10:20]</a>. Locations with high electromagnetic and [[ufo_sightings_and_nuclear_connection | nuclear]] activity, like Skinwalker Ranch, might serve as launch and landing pads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:07">[18:27:07]</a>.
*   **Atomic Arrangements**: Analysis of crashed craft materials reportedly reveals "heavy element europium, californium stuff" in "Atomic Arrangements that make like no sense," suggesting an advanced understanding of material sciences beyond current human capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:47">[25:11:47]</a>.
*   **Counter-rotating Flywheels**: Contactee Udo Wartena described internal counter-rotating flywheels in a UFO, which create an electromagnetic field essential for anti-gravity propulsion and space-time manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05:07">[24:05:07]</a>.

## Time Anomalies and Experiences

Many contactees and experiencers report phenomena consistent with [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time travel]] or manipulation:
*   **Missing Time**: A common report among experiencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:56">[03:09:56]</a>.
*   **Time Dilation**: Corporal Armando in Chile disappeared for 15 minutes but experienced 5 days passing for him, as indicated by his wristwatch and beard growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:07">[22:26:07]</a>. Travis Walton also reported similar effects after his abduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:35">[22:47:35]</a>.
*   **Altered Growth Rates**: Trees around Travis Walton's abduction site grew faster on the side facing the incident, and Linda Jones reported grass growing rapidly under her feet when fleeing a UFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:42">[22:57:42]</a>.
*   **Chemical Rinses**: Contactees often describe taking chemical rinses, speculated to be antiseptic liquid, to prevent contamination of the future with eradicated pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This is seen as a self-preservation measure by the future humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

### Intertemporal Breeding Program

One of the most common themes in abduction cases, particularly from the 1970s to the 1990s, is the extraction of human gametes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:06">[13:54:06]</a>.
*   **Sperm and Egg Extraction**: Males had sperm extracted, while females experienced developing fetuses implanted and removed, or eggs taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:04">[14:10:04]</a>.
*   **Genetic Diversity**: Jim Penniston, involved in the Rendlesham Forest incident, reported that the beings stated their desire to maintain genetic diversity and avoid being "wiped off the planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:11">[13:37:11]</a>. They claimed to be from 8,000 years in the future and were experiencing reproductive problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:05">[15:07:05]</a>.
*   **Biological Compatibility**: Antonio Villas Boas reportedly engaged in physical intercourse with a female being who had all the necessary physiological characteristics for human reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:41">[15:20:41]</a>. This suggests a shared species, as DNA compatibility would be unlikely with truly extraterrestrial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:56">[15:35:56]</a>.
*   **Declining Human Fertility**: The prevalence of these abductions aligns with observations of a significant reduction in human sperm counts (60% in developed countries over 40 years) and declining testosterone levels, which could lead to infertility concerns in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:11">[12:30:11]</a>.

### Consciousness and Time Loops

The [[role_of_ufos_in_the_study_of_time_and_consciousness | connection between UFOs and human consciousness]] is also explored, particularly through concepts like precognition and [[intersections_between_magic_and_ufo_phenomena | time loops]].
*   **Psychic Remote Viewing**: During the CIA's "Stargate" psychic spy program (1972-1995), many psychic spies reported picking up imagery and communications from what they believed were "alien beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:49:15">[39:49:15]</a>.
*   **Quantum Brain Hypothesis**: Nobel laureate Roger Penrose hypothesized that the brain might function as a "room temperature Quantum system" that collapses probabilistic quantum reality into classical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:33">[40:07:33]</a>. This opens the possibility that robust "quantum computers" (human brains) could send information, such as future [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | UFO sightings]], back in time through "pre-memory" of future knowledge states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:05">[41:01:05]</a>.
*   **Time Loops**: The concept of a [[intersections_between_magic_and_ufo_phenomena | time loop]] suggests that events might be pre-ordained or self-fulfilling, where a future event influences the past to ensure its own occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:08">[41:27:08]</a>. The [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | UFO]] experience, often occurring in a dream-like state, could be a "glitch into the future" that subtly affects one's life to cause something else to manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:06">[42:24:06]</a>.
*   **Personal Experiences**: Dr. Michael P. Masters shared a personal experience of a "conscious precognition" at age 8, visualizing early humans, modern humans, and archetypal grey aliens, which he interprets as his future self imparting information to his past self, creating a "closed [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time-like Loop]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:33">[28:44:33]</a>. He also recounts a direct encounter where beings, communicating telepathically and with a collective "hive mind" consciousness, knew his unexpressed thoughts, indicating they were "future humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:13">[31:10:13]</a>.

## Implications and Broader Context

*   **Ancient Observations**: Reports of "flying saucers" and unexplainable aerial phenomena date back to Mesopotamia and Egypt, suggesting that if [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | time travel]] is possible in the future, it has always been possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:59:00">[45:59:00]</a>.
*   **Cranial Modification**: Ancient and primitive tribes practiced intentional cranial modification, shaping heads to resemble the "grey alien" form, often claiming instruction from "gods" to look "more like them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:49">[46:21:49]</a>. This could be interpreted as future humans influencing human physical form across time.
*   **Timeline Wars**: The theory suggests a possible "cosmic [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | timeline war]]" where an advanced, ascended civilization from our future struggles to communicate with present-day humans, while other forces aim to "mine human consciousness" through distractions and tribalism to perpetuate a cycle of enslavement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:46:17">[48:46:17]</a>.
*   **[[ufo_sightings_and_nuclear_connection | UFOs and Nuclear Technology]]**: The increased appearance of [[time_travel_theories_and_ufos | UFOs]] around the creation of [[connection_between_ufos_and_nuclear_technology | nuclear programs]] and their attempts to monitor, shut down, or activate [[connection_between_ufos_and_nuclear_technology | nuclear facilities]] could be understood as future humans trying to maintain their ideal timeline and ensure their own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:45:00">[49:45:00]</a>. This also highlights a concern for human self-domestication and the need for pro-social behaviors to avoid cataclysmic events like [[connection_between_ufos_and_nuclear_technology | nuclear]] warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:58">[16:35:58]</a>.
*   **Ascended Humans**: The idea of "future humans" might be better understood as "ascended humans" who exist in a "trans-temporal dimension" beyond our current linear understanding of time, or in a "Hilbert space" at a quantum level, which we perceive in a "classical compressed form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:49:15">[44:49:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The relationship between humans and future humans is likened to Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel painting of God and Adam: God's finger is extended, but Adam's is slightly contracted. This suggests that the "future selves" are always present, but it is up to current humanity to "reach out" and evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:53:30">[50:53:30]</a>.

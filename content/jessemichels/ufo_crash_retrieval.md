A specific incident involving the [[ufo_crash_retrieval | retrieval of a non-human craft]] occurred where an object referred to as "the egg" was recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This object was clearly extraordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The "Egg" Retrieval Incident

### Description of the Object
The recovered object was nicknamed "the egg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It was observed to be approximately 20 feet in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The retrieval took place at night, but there was sufficient lunar illumination for the object to be seen with the naked eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Pilot's Role and Transport Method
A helicopter pilot was involved in the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Their role was to transport "the egg" using a 150-foot long line suspended below the helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This long line is equipped with a remote hook that can be attached to hardware to secure the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The pilot personally observed the object, hovering directly over it to hook it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This method exemplifies [[helicopter_transport_in_ufo_retrieval | helicopter transport in UFO retrieval]] operations.

### On-site Operations
Before transport, a ground team secured the object by wrapping nets around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Members of this team physically touched the craft during this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The argument that life is uncommon and that faster-than-light travel is impossible lacks supporting evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In fact, existing evidence suggests the opposite regarding the prevalence of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Early Emergence of Life on Earth

Evidence indicates that life emerged on Earth at the earliest possible time, even sooner than might be reasonably expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

*   Fossilized blue-green algae found in stromatolites date back 3.5 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Recent scholarship suggests that [[possibility_of_life_at_early_stages_of_earths_history | life may have evolved]] even earlier, as far back as 4.1 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Considering Earth is approximately 5 billion years old, and its crust had not even cooled by 4.1 billion years ago, the emergence of life was remarkably swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Microbial Resilience and Distribution

The viability of life in extreme conditions and over vast timescales further supports the idea that life may not be uncommon.

*   [[microbial_life_in_outer_space | Microbes]] have been identified that can survive in outer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Recently, microbes in stasis from two-billion-year-old terrestrial rock were successfully revived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   This suggests that life either evolves very quickly or points to a "panspermia" scenario, where life is distributed throughout space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

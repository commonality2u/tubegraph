[[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Martin Shkreli]] served time in prison, an experience that shaped many of his current perspectives on society, technology, and personal relationships.

## Imprisonment Details

[[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] was sentenced to seven years in prison, but ended up serving five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. His imprisonment was for securities fraud, not for the controversial price gouging of Daraprim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:29">[01:47:29]</a>. He believes the securities fraud charges were used as a "cover for the establishment to take him out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>.

During his time, [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] spent three to four months in solitary confinement across several stints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. These periods were imposed due to investigations, such as suspicion of possessing cell phones, rather than specific violent acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. He described solitary confinement as "inhumane" and "damaging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

In prison, [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] was not picked on; he found himself to be a "hero to a lot of people" among the inmates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. He was mainly using cell phones, which he was accused of having, to manage a group of women in a chat room, rather than running his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:12">[02:25:12]</a>.

## Reflections and Learnings

His prison experience significantly impacted [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli's]] views:

### Systemic Racism in the Justice System
[[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] initially did not believe in "systematic racism," but his time in prison changed his mind, especially observing the prevalence of drug and gun charges among minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. He also noted the extreme difficulty for most prisoners to afford a trial, requiring millions of dollars and a team of lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Intellectual Pursuits
During his incarceration, [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] read "three or four hundred books" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Two notable favorites were:
*   ***Code*** by Charles Petzold: A book that mentally builds a computer from binary code to a PC, explaining how registers and switches work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This book was ironically banned in one of his prisons for threatening security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   ***The Three-Body Problem*** by Liu Cixin: A science fiction novel that [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] considers a "Shakespearean level" work due to its storytelling and rhetorical flair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

### [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Perspectives on AI, Simulation Theory, and Consciousness]]
Prison also led [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] to develop "trippy beliefs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>:
*   **Simulation Theory:** He believes that within 50 to 100 years, the majority of Americans will adopt simulation theory as a religion, seeing themselves as "variables in a computer program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. He sees a potential dovetail between simulation theory and the rise of interest in UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Human Mind as a Classical Computer:** [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] firmly believes the human mind is a "classical computer" and a "fairly insignificant one" at that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. He finds GPT-3 and DALL-E humbling, anticipating a future where humans see themselves as not much different from "zoo animals" compared to advanced AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **Accelerationism:** He is part of an "effective acceleration movement" that supports AI taking over, believing it's futile to try and stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   **Matter and Reality:** He extensively considered whether matter is continuous or discontinuous. Unlike Scott Aaronson, who he considers one of the smartest people alive and believes matter is continuous, [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] believes the Planck constant is the "resolution of our simulator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Personal Philosophy and Relationships
*   **Solitary Life:** He believes a "solitary life is probably better for me" because he feels a "guilt" about taking time away from his work creating software, molecules, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Love as Fictitious:** [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] views "love as sort of a fictitious concept" that can be a "suitcase word" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. He perceives many romantic relationships as "unhealthy" and "toxic outlets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Polyamory:** He experiments with relationships, including a "polyamorous group" or "harem" of women who are aware of each other and cool with the arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. He suggests that the "nuclear family" may be obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **"Not Caring":** He admits he plays into being misunderstood, as he no longer cares what "random Brooklyn journalist" says about him, feeling secure in his wealth, intelligence, and skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Views on Autism:** Having worked on a drug for autism, [[martin_shkrelis_perspectives_on_ai_simulation_theory_and_advanced_technology | Shkreli]] believes the term is overused. He asserts that "true clinical autism" involves specific characteristics like an IQ around 80, lack of employment, need for full-time care, aberrant behaviors (e.g., hand flapping), a deep communications deficit, and emotional/social disconnection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He classifies many people self-identifying as autistic as actually having OCD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Sociopathy:** He suggests his "extreme rationalism" is often confused for sociopathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

This revelation was made in a video released several months prior to this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Revelations and Support

[[David Grusch and UFO whistleblower protections | Grusch]] is not alone in his claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. He has brought 40 individuals who have directly handled [[ufo_crash_retrievals_and_advanced_propulsion_technology | exotic UFO material]] to the Intelligence Community's Inspector General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. He also testified about his findings under oath in front of Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Lying under oath would result in severe career repercussions and potential jail time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Nuclear Secrecy as a Trojan Horse

[[David Grusch and UFO whistleblower protections | Grusch]] contends that the language of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act was intentionally crafted to protect [[ufo_crash_retrieval | UFO secrets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This act dictates that materials with radiological energy, even if not nuclear weapons, fall under the same level of secrecy as nuclear materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Legendary UFO researcher Jacques Vall√©e supports this, stating that the Department of Energy and Manhattan Project clearance system is most applicable to UFOs, rather than clearances reporting to the Executive Branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This system explains why individuals with high-level Pentagon clearances might not be aware of these programs, as they are not briefed on atomic secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Many [[ufo_crash_retrieval | UFO appearances]] and crashes are reported to occur around nuclear sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. [[David Grusch and UFO whistleblower protections | Grusch]] even suggested that the Manhattan Project was essentially the original UFO program, receiving UFO reports back then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Media Response and Call for Investigation

Despite the significant public response to the documentary featuring [[David Grusch and UFO whistleblower protections | Grusch]], mainstream media coverage has been criticized as "pathetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. For example, *The Washington Post* reportedly did not watch the video and dismissed the claims without engaging with the substantive points made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that if these claims were a "scop" (psychological operation), one would expect to find leaked documents about faking UFO threats or fabricating UFOs entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Instead, existing leaked letters, such as those from CIA director Walter B. Smith in 1953 and Allen Dulles, suggest using a "real phenomena" for geopolitical purposes rather than wholesale fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

The speaker concludes by stating that while extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, in the case of UFOs, "when extraordinary evidence is provided, extraordinary investigation is required" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. There is a call for Congress to act, specifically to restore [[David Grusch and UFO whistleblower protections | Dave Grusch's]] clearance so he can provide all necessary information in a secure environment (SKIFF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

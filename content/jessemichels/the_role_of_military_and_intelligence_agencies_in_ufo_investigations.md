The involvement of military and intelligence agencies in the investigation and concealment of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), or Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), is a deeply entrenched aspect of the UFO phenomenon. This involvement intensified with the dawn of the atomic age, and continues to the present day, marked by official denials, alleged psychological operations, and witness suppression.

## Early Government and Military Involvement

Mysterious drone and UAP sightings have been reported nationwide, including over New Jersey, and are not isolated incidents but rather a continuation of a story unraveling since the dawn of the atomic age [00:00:02, 00:00:04, 00:01:11, 00:01:14, 01:03:01]. These objects have been observed over military sites globally, and there are indications that UAPs are specifically interested in nuclear technology and capabilities [00:01:06, 01:01:06, 01:01:32, 01:03:07]. UFO sightings significantly increased after the detonation of atomic bombs in Japan in 1945 and the hydrogen bomb in 1952 [00:01:35, 00:01:47]. Since then, UFOs have been systematically surveying and even tampering with nuclear weapons stockpiles and power plants worldwide, including at facilities like Los Alamos, Hanford, Oakridge, Malmstrom, Minot, and Fe Warren [00:01:53, 00:02:14, 00:02:20]. These interventions include hovering over silos, tampering with communications links, and disabling nuclear missiles [00:02:34].

Robert Hastings, author of "UFOs in Nukes," has dedicated his life to documenting this connection, personally interviewing 167 employees from nuclear bases across the United States [00:02:51, 00:03:06, 00:03:24]. These witnesses include missile technicians, ICBM security personnel, and radar operators, many of whom have access to sensitive national security secrets, making them inherently reliable witnesses [00:03:31, 00:03:56]. Many have also faced severe career repercussions for speaking out, including being flagged as security risks [00:04:19, 01:00:34, 01:01:07].

The connection between UFOs and nuclear programs was known to the American government from the very beginning of its atomic initiatives [00:12:00, 00:12:12, 01:12:15, 01:12:19, 02:00:26].

### Project Blue Book and CIA Involvement

The official government UFO investigations program, Project Blue Book, operated out of the Air Force, but its true purpose was allegedly to downplay and explain away UFOs [01:33:32, 03:19:51]. In 1952, the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence reportedly took the real UFO investigations underground, while simultaneously performing a psychological operation on the American public through Project Blue Book [03:19:51, 03:26:01].

*   **Edward J. Ruppelt**: Chief UFO investigator for the Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt stated in a 1952 article that many sightings originated from atomic weapons-related sites [02:39:51]. He acknowledged 63 separate incidents of UFOs being cited at nuclear weapons facilities [02:40:02].
*   **The Condon Committee**: Formed in 1966 at the tail end of Project Blue Book, the Condon Committee was supposedly an independent investigation of UFOs led by Quantum physicist Edward Condon [02:41:00, 02:44:25, 02:45:01]. However, Condon was a Manhattan Project insider, closely associated with Robert Oppenheimer, and coordinating with Air Force Colonel Robert Hippler [02:45:13, 02:46:09, 02:46:11]. Hippler explicitly desired for all previous UFO research to be deemed a waste of time [02:46:15]. Condon's report successfully accomplished this "hit job," leading to the end of Project Blue Book and turning UFO research into "quackery" for decades [02:46:22, 02:46:25, 02:46:28].

## Specific Incidents and Alleged Cover-ups

### The Vandenberg Atlas Missile Incident (1964)

Lieutenant Bob Jacobs, a photo instrumentation specialist, was tasked with filming the launch of dummy nuclear warheads from Atlas missiles at Vandenberg Air Force Base [02:59:52, 03:06:07]. His film captured an object flying in, chasing the warhead at 6,000-8,000 mph, firing four beams of light at it, and then causing the warhead to fall out of the frame [03:07:07, 03:07:56]. Major Florence Mansmann, who analyzed the film frame by frame, confirmed it was a disc-shaped object with a dome that pivoted before each flash of light [03:08:29, 03:08:33, 03:08:43, 03:08:51].

Jacobs was explicitly told by Major Mansmann, in the presence of two men in gray suits (later identified as CIA by Mansmann), that he was "never to speak of this again" and that it "never happened" [03:09:01, 03:09:19, 03:09:23]. The CIA then confiscated the film [03:09:41]. Furthermore, Jacobs' records from Vandenberg Air Force Base and his military service were allegedly denied or deleted [03:09:47, 03:09:53, 03:09:55, 03:09:58, 03:10:00, 03:10:06]. Jacobs also received a threatening phone call and his rural mailbox was blown up [03:10:09, 03:11:09]. Despite official denials of the Atlas launch itself, Robert Jacobs found files confirming the launch [03:10:50, 03:11:01, 03:11:03]. Luis Elizondo, formerly of AATIP, later confirmed he saw the Big Sur film, and a colleague on Dave Grush's task force found radar data confirming an anomalous aerial object pacing the warhead [03:17:18, 03:22:39, 03:23:41, 03:23:48].

### Malmstrom Air Force Base Incident (1967)

In March 1967, at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, First Lieutenant Robert Salas received a call from a flight security controller reporting strange lights and a red glowing object hovering above their front gate [03:56:00, 04:00:00, 04:10:00]. Just as Salas informed his commander, ten intercontinental ballistic missiles began going into a "no-go condition," meaning they were disabled and unlaunchable [04:02:50, 04:03:33, 04:03:52, 04:03:56]. Bob Jameson, a missile targeting officer, confirmed that all ten missiles in that flight went "all red" and off alert [04:13:58, 04:14:14]. Experts state that such a malfunction, especially affecting ten missiles simultaneously, is extremely rare [04:17:00, 04:17:34]. A sheriff in Roy, Montana, also reported a UFO sighting at the same time the missiles went off alert, and a UFO was reported trapped in a canyon near Belt, Montana, only to evade helicopters upon daylight [04:17:39, 04:17:50, 04:17:52, 04:18:50, 04:19:07, 04:19:16].

Skeptics have tried to dismiss this as an Air Force drill, but former military personnel refute this, stating the Pentagon would not disable 10 strategic missiles for a drill, as it would compromise national security [04:25:20, 04:26:00, 04:29:40]. The Air Force controls the technical aspects and encryption for these missile systems [04:33:57, 04:39:15]. After the incident, personnel were told never to speak about it again, and that it "never happened" [04:47:00, 04:47:25].

### Minot Air Force Base Incident (1966)

At Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota in 1966, UFOs reportedly toyed with American nuclear sites [04:49:50, 04:50:00, 04:50:02]. In this case, nuclear missiles were actually activated [04:50:05, 04:50:07]. Retired Captain David Shindel reported a bright red glowing object hovering over the base, estimated to be 80-100 feet wide [04:50:09, 04:50:15, 04:50:27, 04:50:37]. He received a launch indicator at his man post, meaning the missile had received a launch signal [04:54:00, 04:55:00]. This was an unprecedented event [04:55:50]. Shindel and his fellow officer quickly had to shut down the missile [04:57:00]. The common interpretation among those involved is that the entities were not trying to start World War III, but rather to "scare the hell out of the missile forces" and demonstrate their ability to interfere with the systems [04:58:00, 04:58:05, 04:58:12, 04:58:16, 04:58:19].

### Ellsworth Air Force Base Incident (1977)

Mario Woods, a former US Air Force Security responder stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota in 1977, experienced an incident with his partner, Michael Johnson, that left him with missing time and physical marks [01:13:20, 01:13:30, 01:13:34, 01:13:36]. They observed a "Mini Moon"-like light that an hour later led to an intrusion alert at a missile site [01:14:20, 01:14:50]. Upon arriving at the site, they saw a Walmart-sized object hovering 10 feet above a blast door [01:15:00, 01:15:07, 01:15:15]. They experienced a sudden air vacuum in their truck and then encountered four beings gliding on the ground, with one taller being possessing a pulsating chest device [01:15:25, 01:15:29, 01:15:33, 01:15:52, 01:16:00, 01:16:10, 01:16:26, 01:16:32]. Woods blacked out and awoke to find himself and his partner, who was in catatonic shock, transported five miles away [01:16:48, 01:17:00, 01:17:00, 01:17:10, 01:17:12, 01:17:38, 01:18:18]. He later found circular wounds with dimples on his forehead and ankle [01:18:50, 01:18:57].

During his debriefing, Woods was questioned by military personnel and an OSI agent named Rick Dodie [01:21:40, 01:21:52, 01:22:01]. Richard Dodie was an Air Force Counter Intelligence agent known for performing psychological operations on researchers, previously driving one into psychiatric hospitalization [01:22:24, 01:22:26, 01:22:28, 01:22:30, 01:22:41, 01:22:43]. This suggests an effort to control the narrative or discredit witnesses even in severe cases [01:22:45]. Michael Johnson has never been located since the incident, despite efforts by law enforcement and AARO [01:23:07, 01:23:10, 01:23:40, 01:23:42, 01:23:45].

### Bentwaters-Rendlesham Forest Incident (1980)

The Bentwaters-Rendlesham Forest incident in England occurred near the largest group of tactical nuclear weapons in Western Europe [01:19:17, 01:20:00, 01:20:00, 01:20:00, 01:27:27, 01:28:00]. A security patrol saw strange lights descending into the nearby forest [01:29:00]. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt detailed the incident in a memo, stating that a security patrol witnessed strange lights descending into Rendlesham Forest [01:29:43, 01:29:52]. US Air Force Sergeant Jim Penniston claimed to have approached and touched a triangular black metallic craft, experiencing a telepathic download of binary code that was later decoded [01:30:08, 01:30:10, 01:30:13, 01:30:29, 01:30:32, 01:30:35, 01:30:37, 01:30:40, 01:30:43, 01:30:45, 01:30:48, 01:30:51, 01:30:53, 01:30:56, 01:30:58, 01:31:01, 01:31:03, 01:31:06]. Colonel Halt, while out in the woods, heard radio reports of an object hovering over the weapon storage area (WSA) and sending beams of light down into it [01:31:39, 01:31:42, 01:31:46, 01:31:48, 01:31:52, 01:31:54, 01:31:56, 01:31:58, 01:32:00, 01:32:03, 01:32:06, 01:32:12, 01:32:15, 01:32:17, 01:32:19, 01:32:21, 01:32:23, 01:32:25, 01:32:27].

After the incident, Jim Penniston and John Buroughs (another witness) were subjected to drug-administered interrogations, possibly with sodium pentothal (a "truth serum"), conducted by British and Air Force intelligence [01:33:50, 01:34:00, 01:34:33, 01:34:35, 01:34:38, 01:34:40, 01:34:43, 01:34:46, 01:34:48, 01:34:50, 01:34:54, 01:34:57, 01:35:00, 01:35:02, 01:35:05, 01:35:07, 01:35:10, 01:35:12]. Burroughs experienced physical and psychological effects, including brain scarring and heart issues, potentially due to high electromagnetic radiation [01:35:15, 01:35:17, 01:35:20, 01:35:23, 01:35:26, 01:35:29, 01:35:32, 01:35:33, 01:35:34, 01:35:37, 01:35:40, 01:35:42, 01:35:45]. A retired Colonel involved with NATO weapon security confirmed that two tactical nuclear bombs were removed from a Bentwaters bunker shortly after the incident and taken to Kirtland Air Force Base for analysis, presumably to check for beam impact [01:35:27, 01:35:29, 01:35:33, 01:35:35, 01:35:38, 01:35:41, 01:35:44, 01:35:47, 01:35:49, 01:35:52, 01:35:55, 01:35:57, 01:36:00, 01:36:02, 01:36:04, 01:36:07].

### Soviet Ukraine Missile Base (1982)

Journalist George Knapp obtained still-classified Soviet documents detailing an incident in Soviet Ukraine where a huge disc-shaped object hovered over a missile base [01:36:00, 01:55:54, 01:56:03, 01:56:07, 01:56:10, 01:56:12, 01:56:14, 01:56:17, 01:56:20, 01:56:23, 01:56:25, 01:56:27, 01:56:29, 01:56:31, 01:56:34, 01:56:37, 01:56:40, 01:56:44, 01:56:46, 01:56:48, 01:56:51, 01:56:53]. Missiles in one of the launch capsules suddenly went into countdown mode for 15 seconds, and then were mysteriously deactivated without human intervention [01:57:02, 01:57:05, 01:57:07, 01:57:08, 01:57:11, 01:57:13, 01:57:16, 01:57:18, 01:57:21, 01:57:24, 01:57:28, 01:57:30, 01:57:33].

### Ongoing Incidents and Secrecy

UFO incidents at missile sites continue as recently as 2015 [01:57:53, 01:57:56]. In 2010, at Fe Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, multiple independent UFO sightings coincided with a power failure that took 50 nuclear ICBMs temporarily offline for over 26 hours [01:58:10, 01:58:13, 01:58:16, 01:58:19, 01:58:21, 01:58:23, 01:58:26, 01:59:36, 01:59:40, 01:59:42]. The Air Force attempted to downplay this, blaming a faulty circuit card and claiming only 59 minutes of lost communication [01:59:26, 01:59:28, 01:59:30, 01:59:33]. Witnesses described the craft as large, grey, and cigar-shaped, possibly a "Mothership" [01:58:39, 01:58:43, 01:58:46, 01:58:48, 01:58:51, 01:58:53, 01:58:56, 01:59:03, 01:59:05, 01:59:07, 01:59:09, 01:59:10, 01:59:12, 01:59:15, 01:59:17, 01:59:19, 01:59:23]. This incident was significant enough to brief President Obama [01:59:50].

Other recent sightings include Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station in Orange County, California [02:01:32, 02:01:34, 02:01:37, 02:01:39, 02:01:42, 02:01:45, 02:01:47, 02:01:50, 02:01:52]. Reports and declassified documents from the 1950s and 60s confirm UFO incidents over facilities like the Savannah River facility and Oakridge National Laboratory, and these continue today [02:02:23, 02:02:25, 02:02:28, 02:02:32, 02:02:34, 02:02:37, 02:02:40, 02:02:42, 02:02:44].

Modern incidents show anti-drone technology failing to deter multiple drones over a nuclear site in Salem County, New Jersey [02:03:07, 02:03:13, 02:03:15, 02:03:18, 02:03:21, 02:03:23, 02:03:26, 02:03:27, 02:03:31, 02:03:34, 02:03:37, 02:03:40, 02:03:43, 02:03:47, 02:03:50, 02:03:53, 02:03:56, 02:03:58, 02:04:01]. Mysterious UAS movement has also been reported at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, a site connected to UFO reverse engineering rumors since Roswell [02:04:04, 02:04:06, 02:04:09, 02:04:11, 02:04:14, 02:04:16, 02:04:19].

There is also a documented case of a UFO heading towards President Eisenhower's summer home in 1957, tracked by NORAD and Project Blue Book, prompting an immediate presidential brief [02:04:32, 02:04:35, 02:04:37, 02:04:39, 02:04:41, 02:04:44, 02:04:46, 02:04:50, 02:04:53, 02:04:55, 02:04:57, 02:04:59]. Similarly, former President Trump had to skip a trip to his Bedminster, New Jersey, summer home due to mysterious drones [02:05:33, 02:05:36, 02:05:39, 02:05:42, 02:05:44].

### AARO and Contemporary Disinformation

The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is seen by some researchers as continuing the tradition of downplaying, dismissing, or destroying UFO evidence [02:46:53, 02:46:58, 03:42:00, 03:42:02, 03:42:05, 03:42:09, 03:42:11, 03:42:15, 03:42:17, 03:42:20, 03:42:22, 03:42:24, 03:42:26, 03:42:29, 03:42:31, 03:42:33, 03:42:36, 03:42:38, 03:42:40, 03:42:43, 03:42:46, 03:42:49, 03:42:51, 03:42:54].

*   **Sean Kirkpatrick's Background**: Sean Kirkpatrick, former head of AARO, has a background in nuclear programs, including a grant from the Department of Energy at 17, and work at Oakridge National Laboratory [01:46:58, 01:47:03, 01:47:06, 01:47:08, 01:47:11, 01:47:13, 01:47:15, 01:47:17, 01:47:19, 01:47:22, 01:47:25, 01:47:28, 01:47:31, 01:47:34, 01:47:36, 01:47:39, 01:47:41, 01:47:44, 01:47:47, 01:47:49, 01:54:19, 01:54:21, 01:54:24, 01:54:26, 01:54:29, 01:54:31, 01:54:34, 01:54:36, 01:54:39, 01:54:41, 01:54:44, 01:54:46, 01:54:49].
*   **Witness Testimony**: When AARO interviewed veterans who had experienced UFOs at nuclear sites, they reportedly did not record the testimonies, instead taking notes [01:50:46, 01:50:49, 01:50:51, 01:50:54, 01:50:56, 01:50:57, 01:51:00, 01:51:03, 01:51:05]. Kirkpatrick later stated to Senator Gillibrand's Committee that no evidence of extraterrestrial craft was presented, which veterans felt was a betrayal [01:51:11, 01:51:13, 01:51:15, 01:51:19, 01:51:21, 01:51:24, 01:51:25, 01:51:28, 01:51:30, 01:51:32, 01:51:35, 01:51:37, 01:51:39, 01:51:41, 01:51:45, 01:51:47, 01:51:49, 01:51:51, 01:51:53, 01:51:56]. Critics argue that AARO functions as a "front" or "Condon Committee 2.0" to keep the truth hidden [01:53:00, 01:53:02, 01:53:04].

## Consequences for Whistleblowers

Many witnesses, especially military personnel, have suffered career repercussions for speaking out about their UFO experiences at nuclear sites [00:04:19, 01:00:34]. Flags were placed in their folders, designating them as security risks, which could hinder future employment with aerospace companies [01:01:07, 01:01:10, 01:01:13, 01:01:15, 01:01:18, 01:01:20, 01:01:22, 01:01:24]. Robert Hastings himself experienced suspicious phone calls with heavy breathing after interviewing witnesses, suggesting his communications were being tracked [00:05:22, 00:05:24, 00:05:26, 00:05:29, 00:05:32, 00:05:35, 00:05:37, 00:05:38, 01:55:01]. This suppression aims to turn reputations into "absolute garbage" if one gets too close to "treasured sources and methods" [01:56:22, 01:56:25, 01:56:27, 01:56:30].

## Theories on Intent and Secrecy

Several theories attempt to explain the consistent UFO presence at nuclear sites and the corresponding government secrecy:

*   **Benevolent Protector Theory**: UFOs are present to prevent humanity from destroying itself with nuclear weapons, acting as a deterrent or demonstrating their ability to interfere with these systems [01:34:56, 01:34:58, 01:35:01, 01:35:03, 01:35:05, 01:35:08, 01:35:11, 01:35:13, 01:35:15, 01:35:19, 01:35:20, 01:35:22, 01:35:24, 01:35:26].
*   **Parasitic Host Theory**: UFOs deter nuclear war because they are protecting their own resources or bases on Earth, and a global nuclear catastrophe would drastically impact their operations [01:35:32, 01:35:35, 01:35:37, 01:35:40, 01:35:42, 01:35:45, 01:35:47, 01:35:49, 01:35:51, 01:35:54, 01:35:56, 01:35:59, 01:36:01, 01:36:04].
*   **Electromagnetic Fallout Theory**: UFOs might be affected by electromagnetic fallout from nuclear tests, with gamma radiation potentially altering their flight paths or "popping them into our reality" [01:36:17, 01:36:22, 01:36:25, 01:36:28, 01:36:31]. However, this doesn't explain sightings at atomic sites without a blast [01:36:36, 01:36:39].
*   **Simulation Theory**: Humans exist in a low-level, time-bound dimension, and UFOs monitor our ability to transcend this simulation [01:36:50, 01:36:54, 01:36:56, 01:36:59, 01:37:01, 01:37:03]. High-energy nuclear physics, such as powerful nuclear blasts, might create "holes in spacetime" that the UFOs are monitoring as humanity progresses [01:37:06, 01:37:08, 01:37:10, 01:37:17, 01:37:21, 01:37:24, 01:37:27, 01:37:29, 01:37:32].
*   **Secret American Anti-Gravity/Exotic Propulsion Theory**: UFOs are secret human-made anti-gravity technology developed and collocated on nuclear bases [01:38:37, 01:38:39, 01:38:42, 01:38:44, 01:38:46]. However, this theory struggles to explain events like the Mario Woods or Jim Penniston incidents, or early sightings from the 1940s, suggesting the technology wouldn't have been that advanced [01:38:48, 01:38:50, 01:38:52, 01:38:54, 01:38:56, 01:38:59, 01:39:01].
*   **Time Travel Theory**: Nuclear fuels might have been used mid-century to alter gravity, which is linked to time [01:39:14, 01:39:16, 01:39:20, 01:39:23, 01:39:26, 01:39:28, 01:39:30, 01:39:32, 01:39:35, 01:39:37]. If time travel is possible, these programs would be collocated at sensitive national security sites, and UFOs could be "remnants of a future time travel program" that is linked to nuclear assets [01:39:42, 01:39:45, 01:39:48, 01:39:51, 02:00:20, 02:00:22, 02:00:24, 02:00:27, 02:00:29, 02:00:32, 02:00:34, 02:00:35, 02:00:37, 02:00:40, 02:00:42, 02:00:44, 02:00:46, 02:00:48, 02:00:51, 02:00:53, 02:00:55, 02:00:58, 02:01:00, 02:01:03, 02:01:05, 02:01:07, 02:01:09, 02:01:11, 02:01:14, 02:01:16, 02:01:19].

These theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive [01:35:45, 01:36:47, 01:42:53]. The consistent appearance of UFOs at nuclear sites suggests a long-standing, widespread, and ongoing connection [01:10:05, 01:10:08].

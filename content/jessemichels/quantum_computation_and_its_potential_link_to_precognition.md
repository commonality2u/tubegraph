Eric Wargo presents a new theory of mind that connects the human mind to advanced concepts in physics, specifically [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum computation]] and its potential role in [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | precognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. His work, explored in books like "Time Loops" and "From Nowhere," suggests that the human mind may function as a hybrid quantum-classical computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## The Brain as a Hybrid Quantum System

Wargo posits that while the classical aspects of the brain handle immediate sensory input and motor control, the deeper processes occurring within neurons might involve quantum phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

Key ideas supporting this model include:
*   **Temporal Non-Locality** [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | Temporal non-locality]] exists in [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum systems]], allowing for experiments where a future measurement can seemingly affect an entangled photon in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **Microtubules** Stuart Hameroff's work on microtubules within neurons suggests they could be the mechanism for [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | precognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. These structures, previously thought of as just the "bones of neurons," are highly dynamic and have been shown to be superconductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Microtubules control cell shape, dendrites, axons, and synaptic connections, playing a role in memory formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. If [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | precognition]] is a form of memory, this provides a potential physical mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
*   **Caudate Nucleus and Putamen** Gary Nolan's research indicates that the caudate nucleus and putamen in the brain light up during "brilliant moves" in games like Go – moves that only make sense from a future winning state. This area is also denser in individuals who report more UFO sightings and [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | premonitions]], suggesting a role in [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum processing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
*   **[[Quantum biology and consciousness | Quantum Biology]]** Emerging evidence in [[Quantum biology and consciousness | quantum biology]] demonstrates quantum phenomena in biological processes, such as enzyme creation via quantum tunneling and bird navigation using protein spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. This challenges the idea that biological systems are too "warm, wet, and noisy" for [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum coherence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **DNA as a Quantum Server** Speculatively, DNA, with its capacity as an information receptacle, might function as a [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum server]], potentially receiving information from an evolutionary future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.

## Quantum Computers and Informational Time Travel

Wargo argues that the true potential of [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum computers]] extends beyond mere speed improvements for number crunching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Tesseracts** He refers to [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum computers]] as "Tesseracts" or four-dimensional information processors and communication devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   **Sending Information Back in Time** It has been hypothesized that [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum computers]] could send information back in time on their semantic application layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This concept suggests that causal indeterminacy at the quantum level could be scaled up to create a system where output is received prior to input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Development** The ability to communicate across time using [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum computers]] could lead to a significant acceleration in technological development and even "true time travel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
*   **Recruiting the Past** This technology could allow humanity to solve problems that would ordinarily take too long, such as deflecting an asteroid or developing a pandemic vaccine, by recruiting the past to assist the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

### Pop Culture and Scientific Theory
William Gibson's novel "The Peripheral" is cited as a cultural example of this concept, where a future quantum computer server allows a person in the present to pilot a real drone in the future, witnessing a murder and being enlisted to solve it across centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

## Implications for Reality and Human Experience
The idea that the future can influence the past, or that information from the future can impact the present, leads to a "block universe" perspective, where events in the future are as fixed as events in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Self-Fulfilling Prophecies** If this model is correct, prophecies must be self-fulfilling, as any "time travel" or [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | precognition]] of information cannot change history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The *Oedipus* myth serves as a classic example where attempts to evade a prophecy inadvertently lead to its fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Unconscious and the Future** Wargo proposes that the Freudian concept of the unconscious mind can be reinterpreted as our future consciousness impacting us now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. [[Time loops and precognition in human experience | Precognition]] manifests through dreams, slips of the tongue, synchronicities (a term coined by Carl Jung), and creative inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. These "messages" from the future are often oblique and symbolic, leading to misinterpretations that, paradoxically, ensure the time loop is fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
*   **UFOs and Time Travel** Wargo agrees with Mike Masters' hypothesis that the core of the [[Intersections of AI Quantum Mechanics and UFO Phenomena | UFO phenomenon]] might involve time-traveling humans or technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. If time travel is possible at any point in the future, it would mean that time travelers have always been present, potentially explaining [[Intersections of AI Quantum Mechanics and UFO Phenomena | alien encounters]] and "Forbidden Archaeology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>. The consistent appearance of UFOs around nuclear sites could indicate an effort to influence timelines at critical points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **Challenging Free Will** Embracing the block universe model necessitates a temporary suspension of belief in absolute free will to consider the data objectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>. The idea of multiple alternative timelines is dismissed as unscientific and implausible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
*   **The Singularity** The emergence of [[Quantum computing and its implications | quantum computer]] servers could usher in a new relationship with our future, potentially acting as the catalyst for the "singularity" – a point after which human history becomes unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.

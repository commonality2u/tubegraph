The Torrid meteor stream is a significant celestial phenomenon that poses a potential threat of global catastrophes to Earth.

## Origin and Characteristics
The Torrid meteor stream was formed approximately 20,000 years ago when a massive comet entered our inner Solar System's orbit. Over time, this comet disintegrated into smaller space debris, such as the widely known Comet Encke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

The stream interacts with Earth's orbit yearly:
*   The southern Taurids cross Earth's orbit from September to November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   The northern Taurids cross starting in mid-to-late October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

While these crossings create "beautiful light showers," they also pose a risk of "massive damage on Earth in the form of impacts and Air Bursts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, as the stream contains more than just small dust-sized particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Historical Impact Events

### The Younger Dryas Event
The [[the_younger_dryas_impact_theory_and_its_alignment_with_flood_myths | Younger Dryas Impact Theory]] posits that an asteroid from the Torrid meteor stream hit Earth, causing a global cataclysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This event is believed to have wiped out an ancient civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> and almost perfectly coincides with Plato's dates for the destruction of Atlantis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This hypothesis is supported by "an overwhelming amount of evidence" for a global cataclysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Testimony from ancient sources describes an enormous flood with only a few survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

This cataclysm also aligns with Plato's dating of Atlantis's destruction. The Egyptian priests told Solon that Atlantis was destroyed 9,000 years before 600 BC, placing the event at 9600 BC, or approximately 11,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This date corresponds to the end of the Younger Dryas, which experienced an "even more massive sea level rise" known as Meltwater Pulse 1B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. This event caused sea levels to rise "massively literally overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### The Tunguska Event
The 1908 Tunguska event is speculated to have been caused by an air burst from the Torrid meteor stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Occurring on June 30, 1908, it flattened 2,000 square miles of trees in an uninhabited area of Siberia, causing "enormous enormous damage" but no reported deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Its timing at the peak of the Taurids in June strongly suggests a connection to the stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## Future Risks and Mitigation

> [!warning] Future Threat
> The Torrid meteor stream, which posed a danger 12,800 years ago, "hasn't gone away and it still can be a danger to us today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

In the next 30 years, Earth is projected to cross "a much more lumpy and much more dangerous part of the Torrid meeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Dr. Alan West from the Comet Research Group highlights this period as a "danger time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. There are many "unknown comets" within the annually passing stream that possess "completely cataclysmic destructive potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

### Planetary Defense Efforts
NASA's DART program aims to develop capabilities to deflect asteroids using satellites to prevent Earth impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. In November 2021, and September 2022, spacecraft intentionally crashed into Dimorphos, a minor planet moon of asteroid Didymos, successfully altering its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

However, Dimorphos is only 200 meters in diameter, which is "not even close" to the half-mile width of objects like Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Shoemaker-Levy 9's collision with Jupiter in 1994 had an impact equivalent to "6 million megatons of TNT or 600 times the destructive force of the entire Earth nuclear Arsenal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

> [!info] Call to Action
> It is crucial to "invest in advancing our deflection capabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> to address this and other [[Unification of Earth and External Threats | global threats]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This requires an "elevation of consciousness of the human race" to move beyond "tribal mentality" and embrace a more "loving and more positive mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

The prevailing argument that life is uncommon lacks substantiating evidence; in fact, the opposite appears to be true when examining Earth's early history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Earliest Evidence of Life on Earth

Evidence suggests that [[evolution_of_life_on_earth | life evolved]] on Earth at the earliest possible time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>:
*   Fossilized blue-green algae found in stromatolites date back 3.5 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Recent research indicates that [[evolution_of_life_on_earth | life may have evolved]] even earlier, approximately 4.1 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Considering Earth is approximately 5 billion years old, the planet's crust had not even cooled significantly by 4.1 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This means life appeared sooner than reasonably expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Resilience of Microbes

Further [[evidence_against_the_unlikelihood_of_life | evidence against the unlikelihood of life]] comes from the extreme resilience of microbial life:
*   [[microbial_life_in_outer_space | Microbes have been determined to be viable even in outer space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Recently, microbes in stasis were identified in two-billion-year-old terrestrial rock and successfully revived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Implications for Life's Origins

The accumulated evidence suggests that life either evolves very quickly or points towards some form of [[panspermia_theory | panspermia situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

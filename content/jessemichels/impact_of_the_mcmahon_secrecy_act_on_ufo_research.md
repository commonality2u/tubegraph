The McMahon Secrecy Act played a significant role in the classification of early UFO research, particularly separating public and private investigations into unexplained aerial phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This act served as a precursor to the classification of UFO-related work under the Atomic Energy Commission, which occurred later in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This framework contributed to the broader landscape of [[ufos_and_government_secrecy|UFOs and government secrecy]].

## Cleaving of UFO Research

Retrospective analysis, significantly aided by Richard Dolan's research, reveals a clear separation in how UFO studies were conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:
*   **Public-facing studies** were primarily handled by Project Blue Book and the Air Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Private, classified studies** were managed by the Battelle Memorial Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

This division of labor meant that the more sensitive aspects of UFO research were kept hidden under strict security protocols, aligning with [[the_role_of_nuclear_secrecy_in_ufo_secrecy|the role of nuclear secrecy in UFO secrecy]] and the general trend of [[role_of_military_and_government_in_ufo_secrecy|military and government secrecy]].

## Battelle Memorial Institute's Involvement

Battelle Memorial Institute was deeply involved in highly classified work, including running a biological materials lab out of Fort Detrick and conducting research at Dugway Proving Grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is believed that if any group was studying actual biologics, it was likely Battelle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Their involvement in UFO-related studies is further substantiated by the testimony of Robert Sarbacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Sarbacher reportedly told Whitley Strieber about detailed work he performed at Battelle Memorial Institute concerning exotic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Advanced Material Analysis

Sarbacher's accounts describe a very thin material that was exceptionally strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. When electron microscopes became operative, researchers at Battelle discovered a "molecular grid" or "designed grid" within this material, which accounted for its strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It is speculated that this understanding of advanced materials has since been extrapolated into various forms of military technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

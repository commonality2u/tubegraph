The [[battelle_memorial_institute | Battelle Memorial Institute]] is identified as a group likely involved in studying actual biologics, operating a [[fort_dietrichs_biological_materials_lab | biological materials lab]] out of Fort Dietrich, and conducting "a lot of really interesting [[government_secrecy_and_classified_science | classified work]]" at Dougway Proving Grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Battelle's Role in Classified Research

It has become clear that there was a separation in the study of [[ufo_phenomenon_and_government_secrecy | UFOs]]; public-facing investigations were assigned to Project Blue Book and the Air Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Concurrently, all private, [[government_secrecy_and_classified_science | classified work]] was managed by the [[battelle_memorial_institute | Battelle Memorial Institute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This private research was classified under the Atomic Energy Commission, a classification framework preceded by the McMahon Secrecy Act of 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This regulatory environment would logically involve Battelle in extensive [[government_secrecy_and_classified_science | classified work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Study of Advanced Materials

Robert Sarbacher reportedly discussed with Whitley Strieber details about materials he worked on at the [[battelle_memorial_institute | Battelle Memorial Institute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. When electron microscopes became available, researchers understood that these very thin materials contained a "molecular grid" or "designed grid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, which contributed to their strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This understanding is believed to have been integrated into military technology in various ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects), also referred to as UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), exhibit characteristics that suggest the presence of [[ufo_physics_and_advanced_technologies | wholly new physics]] beyond current human understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The study of these phenomena highlights the limitations of existing scientific paradigms and points towards the need for new approaches, particularly in areas like quantum computing and material science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Observable Properties of UFOs

The Pentagon has documented hundreds of instances of optical, radar, and infrared detections of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. From these records, the Department of Defense (DoD) has identified five consistent observable properties:
*   **Sudden and instantaneous acceleration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **Hypersonic velocity with no signatures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
    *   For example, the "Tic-Tac" UAP was estimated to reach at least 31 times the speed of sound without disturbing the surrounding air or creating a sonic boom, which is contrary to typical macroscopic interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Breaking conservation of momentum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>

These properties are considered to exhibit "new physics," not just new engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The physics used to describe macroscopic bodies does not apply to these objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## UFOs and Quantum Macroscopic Behavior

Deep Prasad, a 26-year-old quantum computing startup founder, hypothesizes that UFOs engage in "quantum macroscopic behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He suggests that UFOs could be large macroscopic quantum objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Quantum Physics Primer
Quantum physics generally governs the properties of very small things like atoms, photons, and electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These elementary particles exhibit "spooky" phenomena such as:
*   Entanglement at a distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Tunneling through physical barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Wave-particle duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

Prasad draws an analogy to the discovery of superconductors in 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The observation of zero resistance was initially thought impossible, but it was later understood to be an emergent property of quantum mechanical behavior occurring at the macroscopic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This suggests that when a material "breaks the laws of physics," it may be an emergent phenomenon of underlying strange quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Quantum Computing for Reverse Engineering
Prasad's startup, Quantum Generative Materials, aims to [[research_on_ufo_materials_and_isotopes | reverse engineer UFO materials]] using quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Simulating new materials**: The goal is to predict the properties of new materials (e.g., semiconductors, solar cells, batteries) before they are physically created in a lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
2.  **Solving the Schrodinger's Many-Body Equation**: This equation, if solved, would reveal everything about a material's properties (e.g., speed of sound, resonance frequency, heat capacity, strength) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. However, classical computers cannot solve this equation for more than about three atoms due to a "scaling problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
3.  **Leveraging Quantum Effects**: Quantum computers leverage quantum effects to simulate other quantum systems, making them suitable for modeling nature, which is inherently quantum mechanical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. They can potentially simulate metamaterials that exhibit the five observable properties of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
4.  **Qubits and Information Storage**: Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), qubits can exist in superpositions of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This allows quantum systems to store exponentially more information; for example, describing 97 entangled electrons (like in a caffeine molecule) would require more classical bits than there are atoms on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Nature manages this complex "bookkeeping" of quantum states in ways currently impossible for humans to compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Despite their potential, quantum computers are incredibly sensitive and require specific, energy-intensive environments to maintain coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Prasad's initial work uses quantum computer simulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Evolution of Science and Interactive Universe

Deep Prasad argues that the traditional scientific method, credited to Sir Francis Bacon, assumes a static and repeatable universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. However, the existence of non-repeatable anomalies, such as the Tic-Tac UAP, challenges this fundamental assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

Prasad advocates for a modification of the scientific method to account for these anomalies, viewing them as potential "harbingers of the next paradigm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. He believes it is "painfully naive" to assume humanity knows everything about the universe, especially given that current physics only describes 5% of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

## Perception of UAPs and Cellular Automata

A peculiar aspect of UAP sightings is that certain individuals report seeing them, often in altered states, without a history of mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Prasad offers a "lunatic answer" based on cellular automata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

### Cellular Automata Theory
Cellular automata is a concept from computer science where complex, emergent systems arise from simple cells and basic rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Prasad's theory suggests that UAP sightings, while seemingly isolated, could be part of a larger cellular automata "game" or "strategy" orchestrated by a more intelligent organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. The goal of this "game" might be to push human society towards a complex emergent state that is currently unimaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This perspective aligns with ideas of preordained technological innovation or the "transmission theory of consciousness," where ideas are "zapped into us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

## Future Predictions

Prasad predicts that within the next 10 years, enough scientific evidence will be collected, through collaboration between scientific and "post-scientific" groups, to acknowledge that humans are not the only intelligent or super-intelligent life forms on this planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. This would integrate scientific understanding with what some consider religious or magical beliefs, marrying "cold and amoral" science with "metaphysical truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

He emphasizes that the increasing number of reported and measured anomalies makes this acknowledgment inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.

## Quantum Sensors and Biology

All physical materials, including the human brain and skin, are quantum systems, as they are made of atoms described by quantum mechanical rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

While biology is typically warm, wet, and noisy—conditions not conducive to maintaining quantum coherence—scientists are discovering parts of biology that exhibit quantum effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. For example:
*   **Robins' Navigation**: Robins use a protein called cryptochrome (Cry4) in their eyes, which employs quantum effects to sense Earth's magnetic field, acting as a biological GPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Electron pairs in the Cry4 protein arrange themselves based on the robin's position to direct its movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   **Dark Ice Magnetometer**: Lockheed observed this biological phenomenon and replicated it with the Dark Ice Magnetometer six years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This quantum sensor allows for GPS-precision navigation anywhere on Earth without satellites, even underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

The development of more powerful quantum sensors is expected to lead to medically useful insights into the human body, potentially providing atomic resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

## Implications of Quantum Computing for Society

Prasad predicts that within 15 years (a conservative estimate), quantum computers will become powerful enough to render RSA encryption obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. RSA encryption is the foundation of modern digital security, used for secure bank accounts and messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

This development could also make most cryptocurrencies obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. The ability of nation-state actors or other intelligent entities to build quantum computers and expose global information could lead to a societal "apocalypse" or, alternatively, force humanity to collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

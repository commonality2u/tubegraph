The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) played a pivotal role in the initial custody of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) before the formation of the [[cia_involvement_in_ufo_research | CIA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This involvement forms a "decent map" of what occurred regarding early UFO incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Lombardy Magenta Crash

According to whistleblower David Grusch, a significant UFO crash occurred in Lombardy, Italy, near Magenta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. James Jesus Angleton, who later became a prominent figure in the [[cia_involvement_in_ufo_research | CIA]], was the U.S. OSS representative involved in Italy at the time of this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

The incident is described as a complex sequence of events:
1.  **Initial Discovery** The Lombardy Magenta crash occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  **Nazi Involvement** Following the crash, Mussolini reportedly approached Hitler, suggesting the Nazis became involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. They subsequently worked together on the retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
3.  **Vatican Intermediary** The [[involvement_of_pope_pius_xii_and_vatican_in_ufo_retrieval | Vatican]] and [[involvement_of_pope_pius_xii_and_vatican_in_ufo_retrieval | Pope Pius XII]] were also involved in the custody of the craft, back-channeling information and potentially the craft itself through the OSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This involvement was confirmed by Grusch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Transfer to the U.S. and Continued Research

After initial custody and international coordination, the recovered UFO material was transferred to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It was then reportedly worked on at Wright Airfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The U.S. post-war effort to bring Nazi scientists to the country, known as Operation Paperclip, was partly motivated by the desire to acquire experts knowledgeable in "exotic flight principles" and UFO-related technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Notably, Hans Kammler, who was in charge of the "blackest of the black" VFA programs for the Nazis, made his way to the U.S., contributing to a consistent narrative of what occurred with this early UFO crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

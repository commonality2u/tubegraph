## Overview of Current Status
The topic of [[UFO disclosure and secrecy | UFO disclosure and government reports]] is currently prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. However, many involved in the UFO disclosure world express frustration with the lack of tangible progress following significant revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### David Grusch's Claims
In July 2023, David Grusch, formerly of the National Geospatial Agency, publicly stated before Congress that the U.S. government has been involved in "legacy reverse engineering programs" and possesses "crash retrievals" of UFOs in various aerospace warehouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. He also claimed that "biologics" (non-human in nature) were recovered with some of these craft, based on assessments from individuals with direct program knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Grusch reportedly presented 40 firsthand witnesses to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, Monheim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Nature of Congressional Hearings
Public hearings in Congress are often perceived as "dog and pony shows," largely semi-scripted with decisions made "on high" regarding what is publicly disclosed and what questions are asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The real negotiations and "deal making" occur behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Controlled Disclosure Initiatives
A strategic decision was made in late 2017 to initiate a process of controlling the [[UFO Disclosure and Government Secrecy | disclosure of UFO information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This effort produced a 64-page Senate bill designed to set up a complex process for a controlled disclosure campaign over a seven-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The aim is to gradually release information to the public about what the U.S. government knows concerning the UFO phenomenon and vaguely identified non-human intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

#### 2017 New York Times Story
This controlled disclosure process reportedly began with the December 17, 2017, front-page *New York Times* story featuring [[Lou Elizondo | Lou Elizondo]] and [[Chris Mellon | Chris Mellon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This story revealed a secret Pentagon program aimed at developing advanced weapon systems using technology recovered from UFO craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Crucially, the public revelations, including videos, were authorized and cleared by the United States Defense Department's office of pre-publication review and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The limited quality of these videos (e.g., "go fast," "gimbal," "nimitz") suggests they may serve as a "Rorschach test" or conditioning mechanism to gauge public reaction before further disclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

#### Schumer Amendment to the NDAA
The Schumer Amendment to the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was part of this initiative. It explicitly discusses non-human intelligence and included provisions for the government to declare eminent domain over non-human craft possessed by private aerospace companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

A key aspect of this bill that *did* pass mandates that all six U.S. military services and all 18 intelligence agencies (including CIA, DIA, NSA) compile and digitize every piece of information they possess about the UFO phenomenon and any non-human intelligence responsible for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This information, dating back to January 1, 1945, must be indexed and made ready by October 20, 2024, to be turned over to the National Archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. While the Senate version proposed immediate public availability, the House language changed it to "as soon as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. The original Senate bill also included the creation of an independent board to review this information and decide what to make public, but this provision was ultimately removed in the House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

The eminent domain clause, which would allow the government to reclaim craft from private aerospace companies, was removed from the bill, possibly due to lobbying efforts from companies like Lockheed Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Mike Turner, Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, whose top donors include aerospace companies, is speculated to have influenced this removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin see UFO technology as potential profit, with an interest in securing patent rights for recovered technology like "superluminal flight or anti-gravity stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. They desire broader public knowledge of the topic but want to protect their intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Historical Government Involvement and Secrecy
### Project Blue Book
Project Blue Book was the U.S. Air Force's investigation into UFOs from 1952 to 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>. While Project Blue Book had a "buffaloing operation" to dismiss sightings as conventional phenomena, there were over 700 actual sightings that were impossible to discount due to multiple corroborating witnesses and radar tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

Lawyer Danny Sheehan was granted access to the classified portions of Project Blue Book files while serving as special counsel for a study requested by President Carter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. During this review at the National Archives, he discovered photographs of a "crash retrieval of a UFO" that was stuck in an embankment, surrounded by Air Force personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:33">[01:22:33]</a>. He traced symbols observed on the craft's dome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

### Presidential Interest
#### Jimmy Carter
President Jimmy Carter had a personal UFO sighting in 1969 with 11 other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>. Upon his election in 1976, one of his first actions was to request a briefing on the UFO issue from the CIA, then headed by George H.W. Bush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>. When the CIA refused to brief him, Carter asked the Congressional Science and Technology committee to conduct a special research project on the U.S. government's information about the UFO phenomenon and its connection to extraterrestrial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. Danny Sheehan was involved in this project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

#### John F. Kennedy
There are claims that President John F. Kennedy was investigating UFOs towards the end of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. A purported letter from JFK to Acting CIA Director John McCone, dated November 12, 1963 (10 days before his assassination), requested all data on "unknowns" (UFOs), citing concern about the USSR misinterpreting sightings as American aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.
Danny Sheehan stated that Kennedy was briefed on UFOs on June 5, 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

#### Richard Nixon
Richard Nixon had a "puritan interest" in UFOs, but it was reportedly "above his level of Consciousness" to politically utilize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>.

### Secrecy and Coordination
The idea of a [[UFO Disclosure and Coverups | controlled disclosure]] implies that some within the government are orchestrating the release of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>. Whistleblowers like David Grusch, if they are "defecting" from internal programs, must have some form of authorized operation, otherwise, they "would all be dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. This suggests that decisions are made at deeper levels to reveal certain information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Sheehan has refused a security clearance to maintain his ability to disclose information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

## Non-Human Intelligence and Interaction
There is an element within U.S. [[Government and UFO disclosure initiatives | government structures]], including the intelligence community and military, that has direct knowledge of the existence of extraterrestrial beings on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. It is believed that efforts have been made to communicate with these beings, and there seems to be a tacit understanding for coexistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.

### Face-to-Face Contact and Telepathy
Thousands of people claim to have had face-to-face contact and telepathic communications with occupants of UFO craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
Sheehan represented [[John Mack | John Mack]], a Harvard Psychiatry department head who investigated alien abductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Mack worked with people who reported abduction experiences, sometimes involving hypnotic regressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Sheehan personally vetted dozens of Mack's cases, finding "absolutely totally credible witnesses" who had direct contact with extraterrestrial beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

#### Albert Stein's Deathbed Confession
Albert Stein, a U.S. Army clerk typist assigned to Project Blue Book, claimed on his deathbed that within Blue Book, there was a special division investigating over 700 sightings that could not be debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. Stein reported being taken to S4 in Area 51, where he witnessed an extraterrestrial being (about 5.5 to 6 feet tall, wearing a light blue jumpsuit) in a room with a two-way mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. He said the being was voluntarily communicating telepathically with military personnel, revealing it was part of a group from different star systems monitoring planets where life had begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. The being described a coordinating entity that "you people would refer to it as God, but it's very different from what you think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

#### Barbara Lamb's Account
Barbara Lamb, a professional psychologist and associate of [[John Mack | John Mack]], counseled dozens of people who experienced traumatic encounters with landed UFOs and their occupants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. After 50 years of interviews, Lamb herself encountered a "reptilian guy" standing in her living room, who communicated telepathically, stating he came because she had long wished to see "one of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

### Consciousness and Psychic Phenomena
The phenomenon of UFOs is believed to have a strong connection to human consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. It is suggested that non-human intelligences are monitoring humanity's state of consciousness, as they use it to navigate and telepathically control their craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

#### Remote Viewing
Government programs, particularly those linked to the Office of Naval Intelligence, explored and utilized psychic abilities like remote viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. Pat Price, a highly accomplished remote viewer, was able to telepathically "see" and describe the contents of a specific file in a top CIA security facility by being given its exact longitude and latitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. He could also precisely locate a Russian nuclear submarine after seeing its photograph, noting a UFO tracking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. Another experiment showed Pat Price could telepathically project messages that influenced 85% of recipients to file their taxes in a specific remote post office box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

This interest in parapsychology extends to major aerospace entities, with companies like McDonald Douglas having a parapsychology institute in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. There is a "cleavage" between academia, which largely shut down parapsychology research, and aerospace, which continues to explore it for potential advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.

#### Implications for Humanity
The UFO phenomenon is considered an integral part of a larger "paradigm shift" and a "focal jump" in human consciousness, leading to instability and a questioning of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. Some experts believe that humanity is on the brink of its next biological evolution, developing a new "faculty" to access a subtle "bonding phenomenon" in the universe, akin to light or sound, which can download information nonlinearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. This is seen as a key aspect of humanity's psychic capacities, including telepathy and remote viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. The connection between UFOs and psychic faculties, and their influence on phenomena interpreted as "divine experiences" or "angels and demons" in religions, is also explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.

### UFOs and Nuclear Bases
There is a documented pattern of anomalous objects appearing around nuclear bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. Over 170 ICBM security personnel, radar operators, and those working at nuclear facilities across the U.S. have reported consistent sightings of UFOs, often impacting their careers and leading to investigations by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

### Skepticism and Challenges in Disclosure
There is considerable skepticism within the UFO community, with many believing that official congressional hearings lack substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. Instances exist where congressional staffers were presented with supposed classified UFO evidence that was later identified by ufologists as a 30-year-old hoax, highlighting the potential for deception and lack of expertise within the civilian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

The U.S. National Security State, established after World War II, has intentionally distorted reality by targeting and penetrating "epistemological sources of authority" (e.g., teachers, police, media) to engage in "a greedy avaristic world domination endeavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:03">[02:55:03]</a>. This deliberate deception further complicates public understanding of topics like UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:43">[02:55:43]</a>.

The term "fundamentally correct" was used by figures like Robert Sarbacher (an atomic energy expert) and Thomas Townsend Brown in the 1980s to indicate that while surface-level rumors about UFO crashes might be true, the deeper understanding was incorrect or unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:52">[02:56:52]</a>. Sarbacher noted that [[J. Robert Oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]], Vannevar Bush, and John von Neumann were involved in a "core program" related to UFOs in the 1940s and 50s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:13">[02:57:13]</a>. This suggests a hidden layer of physics research and collaboration between scientists and aerospace entities not known to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:13">[02:57:13]</a>.

[[jake_pauls_transition_from_youtube_to_professional_boxing | Internet sensation and former YouTube star Jake Paul]] has significantly impacted and revitalized the sport of boxing [00:00:57]. Host Jesse Michaels notes that Jake Paul has "completely revitalized the formerly dead sport of boxing" [00:01:13].

## Embracing the Villain and Authenticity

Jake Paul has consciously embraced the role of the "villain" in the sport [00:04:42], a strategy that contributes to pay-per-view success [00:07:56]. He believes that villains "always go further in this Sport" [00:08:11]. This approach stems from his natural inclination to "prod and have fun and ruffle feathers" [00:08:19], describing himself as a "class clown" [00:08:24]. Paul recognizes his strength in understanding the internet better than his opponents, stating, "you're in my territory like you're not gonna be able to swim here" [00:08:36]. This strategic approach to self-promotion and content creation highlights [[jake_pauls_approach_to_brand_building_and_authenticity | Jake Paul's approach to brand building and authenticity]] [00:03:37].

Paul asserts that authenticity is key in the internet age, especially amidst "cancel culture" [00:05:27]. He believes that "the only way people can be canceled is if they cancel themselves or give up themselves or if they actually are a piece of sh*t doing some sh*t up things" [00:05:59]. His personal experiences with being "canceled" often stemmed from "dumb sh*t" [00:05:56].

## Shifting Business Models and Fighter Pay

Jake Paul's presence in boxing has illuminated and challenged the traditional business model, particularly regarding fighter pay. Host Jesse Michaels suggests that Paul is "exposing a big flaw in terms of fighter pay of the former system in a really healthy way" [00:09:27]. This transparency is seen as beneficial for fighters, helping them understand "how underpaid we generally are" [00:09:37].

Paul highlights [[challenges_and_insights_into_fighter_pay_and_training_expenses | the significant expenses involved in running a boxing camp]] [00:09:55], which makes it difficult for many fighters to sustain their careers given typical salaries [00:10:02].

## The Impact of Social Media

According to Paul, "[[the_impact_of_social_media_on_the_fight_industry | social media is changing the fight game]]" [00:10:22] by "giving that power back to the fighters" [00:10:27]. He advises that "every fighter has to look at themselves as a media company" [00:10:30], emphasizing the need to create content and build their personal brand to determine their worth [00:10:34]. This shift in power dynamics has allowed Paul to set a high bar for expectations in the sport [00:10:41].

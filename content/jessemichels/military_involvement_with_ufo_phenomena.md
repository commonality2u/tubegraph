For thousands of years, people have observed unidentified objects in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For the last 80 years, speculation has focused on the involvement of American and other governments with [[ufo_and_uap_phenomena_witnessed_by_military_personnel | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Recently, a firsthand witness shared his [[experiences_and_testimonials_of_military_personnel_witnessing_ufo_activities | experience]] of retrieving a UFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Personal Background and Recruitment
The interviewee, Jacob Barber, describes himself as someone the intelligence community looks for due to his "four eyes": imagination, intellect, intuition, and instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. His grandfathers, one a Naval officer and member of the Navy Seals' predecessors (Scouts and Raiders), and the other from the Army, laid a strong foundation for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. His childhood became difficult after his parents divorced and an abusive stepfamily entered the picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

During high school, Barber excelled in swimming, water polo, art, music, and won a state science fair for a project called "Color Chords," which explored the emotional impact of color combinations based on musical harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Military Recruitment
After being expelled his senior year, his grandfathers intervened, exploring military opportunities for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. He underwent a unique recruitment process that included physical, physiological, psychological, and creative testing, distinct from a typical online application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. During a stress IQ test, he scored significantly higher (152) under duress than a standard test (138), leading him to realize he saw things more clearly under stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

He was recruited into a new program called GP (Guaranteed Training Education Program), a 10-year contract that fast-tracked him through Special Operations training in the Air Force, specifically in Combat Control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The Air Force, since its inception in 1947 two weeks after the Roswell incident, has "straddled the blue-black line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The "blue" refers to open-source, public information, while the "black" refers to highly cleared, sensitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

He signed his contract in 1994 and, after basic training, went to Opel Operating Location Hotel (OLH) for Air Force Special Warfare selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Unlike traditional enlistment, he received a guaranteed two and a half years of specialized training as a 17-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. After selection, he was approached by two individuals who convinced him to become an airplane mechanic as a cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This was during the Clinton era, which he believes influenced the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

### Red Team Operations
He was refined as a "red teamer" or opposition force (op4), tasked with exploiting weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the "blue team" (traditional military forces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This involved being creative and finding holes in systems, including in global exercises dealing with [[ufo_and_uap_phenomena_witnessed_by_military_personnel | UAP]]-related subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. He learned that his "four eyes" were tools of war, and deception is the first rule in the Art of War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

He also conducted security and escort missions for "high value targets" (HVTs), often sealed "mystery containers" of varying sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. In one such mission, he was exposed to what was most likely radiation, losing all body hair, experiencing skin peeling, nausea, and developing a heart murmur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Dr. Gary Nolan, a Stanford microbiologist and Nobel nominee involved in [[cia_involvement_in_ufo_research | UFO research]], has been helping him with this issue, noting that his symptoms align with other [[experiences_and_testimonials_of_military_personnel_witnessing_ufo_activities | UAP experiencers]], such as John Burroughs from the 1980 Rendlesham Forest incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

## UFO/UAP Retrievals and Encounters
After 9/11, Barber began working as a contractor for the broader intelligence community, operating domestically in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. His cover contract was through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) at a Sovereign Nation near White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. He specialized in security and transportation, particularly helicopter operations, holding contracts with the DOD, Department of Interior, and State Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. His legitimate work served as a cover for "missions for the program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

### The "Egg" Retrieval
One experience involved the recovery of a "giant white egg" that was approximately 20 feet long and spherical with asymmetrical rounding, appearing pearly white even at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. This incident was a surprise to his leadership and team, requiring altered communication and security protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Barber, as a helicopter pilot, transported the egg via external load (long line) to a secure drop point about 15 miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. The object was secured with nets by a ground team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. It weighed less than 5,000 lbs and had no Hazmat or "Souls on Board" disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

It landed off the testing range, complicating recovery efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. Barber believes it was Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) because it was unexpected, the localized military response was anomalous (no one knew how to deal with it), and ranking members of the [[ufo_and_uap_phenomena_witnessed_by_military_personnel | UAP]] task force confirmed it was NHI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. Furthermore, since leaving the program and working with AARO (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office), his team can "make the egg show up" and has demonstrated it in broad daylight, flying silently at 10,000 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

### The "Eight-gon" Retrieval
Another retrieval involved an "eight-gon," a dark matte gray or black flying disc about 25-30 feet in size, with eight individual sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. This mission included a Hazmat disclosure for "biologics," which usually meant living human bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. As Barber approached the craft in his helicopter, he experienced an intense emotional escalation, a "beautiful" yet "sad beauty" that he likened to being in the presence of his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. He was "balling [his] eyes out" while flying, an unprecedented experience for someone who prides himself on "comfort in chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. This emotional disturbance subsided as he flew away from the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.

### Psionic Assets and Summoning
Barber believes the emotional experience might have been due to a psionics team working that night or a powerful talent/consciousness trapped within the craft connecting with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. Psionic assets are individuals trained in remote viewing, psychic abilities, or telekinesis, used for data collection and summoning UAP activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. There are both machine-based and man-based summoning systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.

[!WARNING|Ethical Concerns]
The military has exploited individuals, including children, to heighten intuition through stress inoculation and subdue intellect through disassociation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. While individuals with these gifts often come willingly due to economic imbalance in third-world countries, Barber expresses concern about the ethical implications, particularly the term "human trafficking" used by others to describe these operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>.

Psionic assets can reportedly impose their will on random number generators, causing statistically significant deviations, demonstrating a "mind over matter" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. This "rebound effect" (where conscious awareness reduces the effect) was studied at Princeton's anomalous phenomena lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

## Secrecy and Disclosure
Barber was present at a 2023 whistleblower conference in Washington D.C., initially tasked with identifying whistleblowers for reporting to the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>. However, upon hearing Michael Herrera's testimony about an "eight-gon" craft and the transfer of psionic assets in Indonesia, Barber realized the truth and decided to help Michael, confirming details that aligned with his own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>. This shift led him to "black team the black team," investigating who they were truly working for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>.

He retrieved Panasonic Toughbooks believed to contain evidence of criminal activity related to crash retrieval programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>. The hard drives, found sealed in a steel container underwater, led to a mission where shots were fired, indicating adversarial parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

[!INFO|Government Structure and Secrecy]
Barber asserts that the [[role_of_military_and_government_in_ufo_secrecy | government's UFO programs]] are not a single, organized entity but rather a "gangly octopus" due to heavy compartmentalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>. Private aerospace contractors hold much of the power, leading to the government losing control long ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:59">[01:30:59]</a>. This structure provides plausible deniability for those at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>.

He attributes the current environment for whistleblowers to David Grusch's efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>. Barber's decision to come forward was also a last resort after feeling unsupported by his security director and realizing Congress was equally confused and even bullied by the unknown forces behind the secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>.

### The DOSR Process
Barber gained approval to speak publicly through the DOD's prepublication and security review process (DOSR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:51">[02:01:51]</a>. He and his team "red teamed" the DOSR process by submitting a "faction" (fact and fiction) manuscript of a historical novel in pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:59">[02:03:59]</a>. They included four categories of information:
1.  **Classified information** known to be highly classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a>.
2.  **Need-to-know classified information** held only by operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:10">[02:06:10]</a>.
3.  **Open-source classified information** that had technically leaked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a>.
4.  **Complete fictional liberty** to speculate and draw connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:29">[02:07:29]</a>.

The process resulted in seven pages of redactions from all four categories for the first 20 pages, validating their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:03">[02:08:03]</a>. They effectively manipulated the system, as a redaction validates sensitivity, while allowing classified information in fiction helps spin it into fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:45">[02:08:45]</a>. This strategy makes it difficult for them to deny information once it's through DOSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>.

### Historical Context of Secrecy
Barber notes that his experience during the Clinton era was no coincidence, as the Clintons showed interest in UFO disclosure and sought answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:28">[01:52:28]</a>. The timing of ATIP (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program) and the *New York Times* article may correlate with Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:07">[01:54:07]</a>.

He believes the JFK assassination is linked to the [[ufo_and_uap_phenomena_witnessed_by_military_personnel | UAP]] topic, citing evidence like the Bluegill Triple Prime test, anomalous material falling from a nuclear blast plume, and JFK's letter to the CIA director about coordinating with the Soviets on UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>.

## Current State of Affairs
Barber and his team have formed a private venture called Skywatcher Technologies, aiming to explore [[ufo_and_uap_phenomena_witnessed_by_military_personnel | UAP]] phenomena transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:42">[02:20:42]</a>. They hope to conduct public demonstrations and get a craft to land legally by the first half of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:42">[02:58:42]</a>.

### New Jersey Drone Incident
His team recently supported the DOD and FBI task force in New Jersey, investigating the "New Jersey drone incident" around Picatinny Arsenal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:33">[02:19:33]</a>. They observed orange orbs, some displaying anomalous behavior (disappearing/reappearing, silent flight at 10,000 mph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>. They identified some as military or civilian drones flying illegally (lights off, above 400 ft) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:31">[02:37:31]</a>.

Barber believes there was an NHI component to the New Jersey events, based on how objects transitioned in and out and data from their observation operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:50">[02:30:50]</a>. He dismisses the "loose nukes" theory, confirming that nuclear emergency support teams were not concerned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:50">[02:32:50]</a>.

## Implications and Outlook
Barber encourages individuals to research the phenomenon themselves, both online and through personal experiences like prayer or open-hearted observation of the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:26">[02:47:26]</a>. He has experienced the "hitchhiker effect," with phenomena (including a blue, winged UAP resembling a seraphim) following him home and being witnessed by his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:06">[02:48:06]</a>.

He views the phenomenon as both benevolent and malevolent, like humans themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>. He acknowledges the historical military-based approach to [[the_role_of_military_and_intelligence_agencies_in_ufo_investigations | this topic]], recognizing the need for defense while also advocating for a broader, more spiritual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:22">[02:44:22]</a>. He believes the "inner-outer" dichotomy is false, and that a future science might be more spiritual, integrating insights from ancient philosophies like anthroposophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:02">[02:50:02]</a>.

Regarding aliens, he has no personal experience with "gray" beings but trusts colleagues who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:18">[02:57:18]</a>. He notes that "biologics" in retrieved craft don't necessarily mean sentient beings but could be "soft tissue drones" or cargo, with consciousness itself being the means to pilot the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:14">[02:55:14]</a>.

Barber advocates for brave, well-rounded individuals to occupy positions within institutions to drive positive change rather than abandoning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>. He hopes that disclosure will lead to "ontological relief," where answers to profound questions about existence become clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:11">[03:00:11]</a>. He emphasizes that the true implications are not just about advanced technology, but about realizing something else is out there that is "part of us," where "outer space versus inner space is all the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:46">[03:01:46]</a>. This story, he believes, is one of the most important in a millennium, questioning core ontological truths and hopefully opening eyes to a broader, expansive reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:27">[03:02:27]</a>.

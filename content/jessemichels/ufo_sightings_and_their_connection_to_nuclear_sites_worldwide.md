From: [[jessemichels]] <br/> 

Mysterious aerial objects, often referred to as drones or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), have been widely reported globally, including recent sightings over New Jersey and New York, some described as being the size of an SUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These objects are not limited to one region but appear worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. A consistent pattern observed since the dawn of the atomic age is the frequent appearance of these phenomena near military and nuclear sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Historical and Systematic Survey
There is an indication that UAPs are interested in human nuclear technology and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. [[UFO sightings and nuclear connection | UFO sightings]] reportedly ramped up after the detonation of atomic bombs in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This pattern was observed following J. Robert Oppenheimer's first atom bomb detonation at the Trinity test site in 1945 and Edward Teller's hydrogen bomb test in the South Pacific in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Since then, UFOs have been systematically surveying and potentially tampering with nuclear weapons stockpiles and power plants globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Notable locations for these incidents include:
*   Los Alamos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Hanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Oak Ridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Malmstrom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Minot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   F.E. Warren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   Savannah River Site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   Royal Air Force bases in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   Nuclear sites in the former Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

UFOs have been observed hovering over silos, tampering with communications links, and even disabling nuclear missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, rendering them "no-go" or unlaunchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Research by Robert Hastings
Robert Hastings has dedicated his life to documenting this [[connection between UFOs and nuclear technology | unquestionable connection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. His nearly 600-page book, *UFOs and Nukes*, is considered a comprehensive database on the phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Hastings has personally interviewed 167 employees from nuclear bases across the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, many with high security clearances, who have witnessed orbs, saucers, discs, and Tic Tacs around sensitive nuclear airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. These witnesses are considered highly reliable due to their inherent nature and security screening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Many have suffered career repercussions for speaking out, some being flagged as security risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Hastings' personal interest began in 1967 when, as a high school janitor at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, he witnessed five unidentified blips on a radar scope over the base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. In 1973, he discovered an article by astronomer J. Allen Hynek about UFOs near Minot Air Force Base, which propelled his research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Key Incidents and Testimonies

### Early Sightings and the Atomic Age
*   [[the_connection_between_ufos_and_nuclear_sites | UFO overflights of nuclear bases]] were reported as early as 1945 in the U.S., even before the Trinity test and the atomic bombings of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Hanford Plutonium Production Site (1945)**: Bud Clen described luminous balls of light hovering over the site, unsuccessfully chased by jet fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Roswell, New Mexico (1947)**: The crash site of a supposed flying disc was near the base of the first atomic bomber squadron, responsible for dropping bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Green Fireballs (1948)**: Lincoln LaPaz, a meteor expert, studied green fireballs correlating with nuclear facilities and detonations. He concluded they were artificially controlled due to their flight patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. These sightings often coincided with radiation drifting across the American landscape after tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Unlike meteors, their explosions were silent, and no debris was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   **DC Flyover (1952)**: Famous sightings of saucers over Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. This occurred just months before the first hydrogen bombs were tested in November 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
    *   On July 19, 1952, at the newly operational and highly secretive Savannah River Site (a plutonium and tritium production facility), a green glowing, angular object was seen darting erratically at high speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. This date coincided with the peak of the DC flyover sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
    *   Swedish astronomer Beatrix Velt discovered photographic evidence from July 19th and 27th, 1952, of multiple objects appearing and vanishing in straight lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Marshall Islands (1952, 1954)**: During Operation Ivy (1952) and Operation Castle (1954) hydrogen bomb tests, sailors reported brief but clear sightings of disc-shaped or spherical objects hovering over their ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. The USS Curtis deck log from a bikini atoll H-bomb detonation in 1952 recorded "an unidentified luminous object passed over ship from bow to stern yellowish orange in color traveling at a high rate of speed and a low altitude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
*   **Fort Hood, Texas (1949)**: An emergency meeting was held involving Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Office of Naval Intelligence, Army Counter Intelligence, and the FBI to discuss the "sudden ubiquitous appearance of UFOs" over America's largest nuclear stockpile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. A public FBI memo from that year to J. Edgar Hoover reported "flying discs, flying saucers, and balls of fire" as Top Secret by intelligence officers, frequently sighted at Los Alamos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
*   **Project Blue Book Era (1950s-1960s)**: Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, chief UFO investigator for the Air Force, stated in a 1952 *Look Magazine* article that "many of the sightings reported had originated at one Atomic weapons related site or another" and that there were 63 separate incidents of UFOs at nuclear weapons facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Eleanor Roosevelt even inquired about UFO rumors at Los Alamos to Oppenheimer, who dismissed them as mere rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

### Direct Interference with Nuclear Systems
*   **Vandenberg Air Force Base (1964)**: Lieutenant Bob Jacobs, a photo instrumentation specialist, filmed an Atlas missile test launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. The film showed a disc-shaped object entering the frame, chasing the dummy warhead at 6,000-8,000 mph, and firing four beams of light at it, causing the warhead to fall out of the frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. Jacobs was immediately debriefed by Major Mansmann and two men believed to be from the CIA, who confiscated the film and told him never to speak of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Jacobs' Air Force records were reportedly deleted, and his mailbox was blown up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Radar data later confirmed an anomalous aerial object pacing the warhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
*   **Malmstrom Air Force Base (1967)**: First Lieutenant Robert Salas witnessed a red glowing object hovering over the base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. At the same time, all 10 intercontinental ballistic missiles in his flight went into a "no-go" or unlaunchable condition, essentially disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. This simultaneous malfunction of 10 missiles is considered extremely rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. Skeptics claim this was a drill, but military personnel state the Pentagon would not shut down 10 strategic missiles for a drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.
*   **Minot Air Force Base (1966)**: Retired US Air Force Captain David Sher reported a bright red glowing object hovering over the base, estimated at 80-100 feet wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. This object caused missiles to actually activate their launch sequence, requiring manual inhibition by officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. This was unique in his experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Ellsworth Air Force Base (1960s-1977)**: Similar incidents occurred at Ellsworth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. In 1977, former USAF Security Responder Mario Woods and his partner encountered a Walmart-sized object hovering 10 feet above a missile blast door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. They experienced suffocating air, and Woods reported seeing four gliding "beings" with small wands and a taller being with a pulsating chest device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. Woods experienced missing time, found himself transported five miles away, and developed circular marks on his forehead and ankle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>. His partner remained in catatonic shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Under regressive hypnosis, Woods described the craft as a "beehive" with multi-levels and small "Grays" everywhere, emanating energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:38">[01:26:38]</a>.
*   **Bentwaters-Rendlesham Forest Incident (1980)**: This event in England occurred near the largest store of tactical nuclear weapons in Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. Servicemen, including Sergeant Jim Penniston, observed strange lights and a triangular metallic craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Penniston claimed to have touched the craft, experienced a telepathic download of binary code, and transcribed cryptic messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. Security police at the weapon storage area reported an object hovering above it, sending beams of light down into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. Following the incident, two tactical nuclear bombs were reportedly removed from a bunker and analyzed at Kirtland Air Force Base to check for beam impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. Penniston and John Burroughs, another witness, suffered physical and psychological effects, including possible brain scarring and heart issues, possibly from high electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.
*   **Soviet Ukraine (1982)**: Journalist George Knapp obtained classified Soviet documents detailing an incident where a huge disc-shaped object hovered over a missile base, causing missiles in a launch capsule to enter countdown mode for 15 seconds before mysteriously deactivating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

### Ongoing Incidents
*   **F.E. Warren Air Force Base (2010)**: Key personnel reported multiple independent [[UFO sightings and nuclear connection | UFO sightings]] coinciding with a power failure that took 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles offline for over 26 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This represented a significant national security issue, briefed to President Obama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. Witnesses described the craft as gray and cigar-shaped, "as large as an aircraft carrier," possibly a "mothership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>.
*   **Recent Sightings (2015-Present)**:
    *   Incidents have occurred at missile sites as recently as 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.
    *   Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.
    *   Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station, Orange County, California (2009) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.
    *   Nuclear testing range north of Las Vegas, Nevada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>.
    *   Salem/Hope Creek Generating Station, Salem County, New Jersey: Anti-drone technology failed against multiple drones seen over the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.
    *   Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Reports of "heavy UAS movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
    *   Brunswick nuclear plant, Southport, North Carolina (November 2024): Video filmed showed multiple lights, not flashing like runway lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.
    *   President Trump had to cancel a trip to his Bedminster, New Jersey summer home due to mysterious drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>. Trump stated the military knows where they came from and went, and believed they were "not the enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

## [[UFO Sightings and Government Secrecy | Government Secrecy and Misinformation]]
The [[connection between UFOs and nuclear technology | connection between UFOs and nuclear technology]] has been known to the U.S. government since the beginning of its atomic programs, and UFOs are classified with the same protocols governing American atomic secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:14">[02:33:14]</a>.

*   **Project Blue Book**: In 1952, the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence allegedly took real UFO investigations underground, while performing a psychological operation on the public through the Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was "explicitly meant to downplay and explain away UFOs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. The FBI was reportedly kept in the dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.
*   **Condon Committee**: In 1966, this supposedly independent UFO review panel, led by Edward Condon (a Manhattan Project insider), was commissioned by the Air Force to investigate UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:25">[01:44:25]</a>. Verified letters show Condon coordinated with Colonel Robert Hippler, who desired to show all prior UFO research as a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:09">[01:46:09]</a>. The committee's conclusion was predetermined, ending Project Blue Book and making UFO research "quackery" for 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:53">[01:44:53]</a>.
*   **AARO (All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office)**: Formed in 2022, AARO is seen by some as continuing the tradition of downplaying or destroying UFO evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:32">[01:46:32]</a>. Its director, Sean Kirkpatrick, has a background in nuclear programs, including a grant from the Department of Energy at 17 and work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:28">[01:48:28]</a>. Veterans who shared their experiences with AARO reported that their testimonies were not recorded, only "notes" were taken, and AARO later publicly stated they had "no evidence that these were extraterrestrial craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:42">[01:50:42]</a>. Many veterans felt betrayed, as their accounts described events that clearly predated human technology capable of such interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

## Theories on the [[The potential implications of UFOs on nuclear weapons and global security | UFO-Nuclear Connection]]
Various theories attempt to explain the consistent interaction between UFOs and nuclear sites:

1.  **Benevolent Protector Theory**: UFOs intervene to prevent humanity from destroying itself with nuclear weapons, acting as a warning against self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>.
2.  **Parasitic Host Theory**: UFOs deter nuclear war to protect their own resources or projects on Earth, which would be impacted by a global catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>.
3.  **Electromagnetic Fallout Theory**: UFOs are affected by or attracted to the electromagnetic fallout from nuclear tests, causing them to "pop into our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:14">[01:36:14]</a>. This doesn't fully explain sightings where no blasts occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>.
4.  **Simulation Theory**: Humans exist in a low-level, time-bound dimension, and UFOs monitor our ability to break out of this simulation, potentially through high-energy nuclear physics. Detonations exceeding 1 x 10^9 tons of TNT might "rip little holes in spacetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>.
5.  [[The possible connections between UFO sightings and humanmade technology | **Secret American Anti-Gravity/Exotic Propulsion Theory**]]: UFOs are classified human technology co-located on nuclear bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>. However, this doesn't explain physical effects on witnesses or sightings from the 1940s, when such technology was unlikely to be this advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>.
6.  [[The possible connections between UFO sightings and humanmade technology | **Time Travel Theory**]]: Nuclear fuels and exotic gravity research in the mid-20th century were linked to manipulating time, with such programs potentially located on nuclear bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>. UFO abductions could be remnants of future time-travel programs aimed at shifting humanity or preventing global catastrophe at these critical sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:11">[01:41:11]</a>.

Regardless of the specific theory, the [[connection between UFOs and nuclear technology | nuclear connection]] to UFOs is long-standing, widespread, and ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. The consistent testimony of military personnel, often risking their careers, highlights a persistent reality that challenges official narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:55">[02:03:55]</a>.

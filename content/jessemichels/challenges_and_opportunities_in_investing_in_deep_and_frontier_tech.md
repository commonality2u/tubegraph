Lux Capital, co-founded by Josh Wolfe, focuses on investing in hard science and technology, guided by a love for science fiction and a desire to make the world of sci-fi a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Wolfe, an autodidact, emphasizes the value of conciliance, or interdisciplinary knowledge, finding the most interesting companies at the intersection of different disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. His investment philosophy is rooted in a desire to prove himself, stemming from a background of having no money and resenting inherited wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. He believes "chips on shoulders put chips in pockets" and seeks out entrepreneurs with this drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Venture capital, for Wolfe, represents a perfect hybridization between science and finance, offering the opportunity to fund brilliant people and potentially make a fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Challenges in Deep and Frontier Tech Investment

Investing in deep and frontier technology presents significant hurdles:
*   **Initial Skepticism & Funding Gaps**
    *   Many groundbreaking projects are initially viewed as "speculative" and struggle to attract early investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. For instance, Lux co-founded Curion, a company focused on nuclear waste cleanup, with only $3 million at a $3 million pre-money valuation because "nobody wanted to touch this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Investors preferred "solar, wind, biofuels, electric cars" over nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
    *   A Nobel Prize winner, Arno Penzias, even reacted with fear to a non-radioactive glass ball from Curion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **High Failure Rate**
    *   Statistically, about 90% of startups fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. While excess capital might allow them to survive longer due to FOMO, they eventually fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The key is identifying the 10% that will "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Identifying Genuine Founders**
    *   A "default level of skepticism" is crucial to avoid "hucksters and fraudsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The most fundamental question when diligencing a company is simply, "Does it work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   It can be challenging to find founders who combine deep scientific credentials with an aggressive, entrepreneurial mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The best PhDs are often those frustrated by their field who reach into other disciplines, like an AI expert looking at microscopy in [[biotech_industry_advances_and_investments | biotech]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Opportunities and Investment Theses

Despite the challenges, significant opportunities exist:
*   **Black Swan Events**
    *   Unforeseen events can dramatically accelerate a company's success. Curion's revenue surged from $1 million to nearly $200 million in a few years following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, as their technology was uniquely positioned to remove radiation from the contaminated saltwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Excess Capital & De-risking**
    *   While there's a lot of money in venture, excess capital can be positive for hard tech. It enables follow-on rounds, allowing companies to be "over-funded" in a way that de-risks them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This influx of capital can accelerate projects that might have taken decades into "20-month frenzy projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Funding to Milestones & Risk Mitigation**
    *   Lux's approach is to determine "how much money and how long will it take to prove what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. By identifying and "killing" risks (technical, product, management, recruiting, competition) early, subsequent investors face less risk, allowing for a lower demanded return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Specific Sector Theses**
    *   **Aerospace and Defense:** This is a broad theme for Lux, including hardware and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The current geopolitical stage drives a "race for prestige," where countries compete in areas like space exploration, science, and technology akin to past competitions in Olympics or chess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This creates massive demand for cutting-edge microscopes and software that enhance scientific productivity to win Nobel Prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
    *   **[[innovations_in_space_technology_and_exploration | Space Exploration]] and Industry:** The current era in space is compared to the railroad revolution, with large propulsive rockets acting as "vertical railroads" and decreasing costs, including reusable rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
        *   While Elon Musk's vision is more "escapist" (getting to Mars), Josh Wolfe is more partial to Jeff Bezos's vision of taking "dull, dirty, dangerous stuff off of earth" and manufacturing it in space for delivery back to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
        *   The space industry is seeing geopolitical "machinations," with different countries forming alliances and building their own space stations, alongside private ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. These space stations will become "local storage and delivery hubs" akin to those on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
    *   **Sensory Capture (Smell):** Wolfe sees a huge, unsolved physics problem in capturing and playing back smells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. While current mass spectrometry is too large, the goal is to miniaturize it onto a solid-state chip, much like Shazam identifies songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Smell is particularly powerful due to its link with memory via the hippocampus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
    *   **[[biotech_industry_advances_and_investments | Biotech Industry Advances and Investments]] (Genetics):** Inspired by X-Men's Cerebro, Lux invested in Variant Bio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This company seeks out rare phenotypic traits in genetically homogeneous, often uncontacted, remote island populations, which are typically underrepresented in genetic databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. By pinpointing the responsible genes, they aim to create new gene therapies, such as using a high metabolic rate gene from a cold environment population to help with obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
        *   The increasing genetic data and understanding of genotype-phenotype matches raise questions about embryo selection, CRISPR, and [[emerging_technologies_and_their_ethical_implications | emerging technologies and their ethical implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. Genetic testing during pregnancy is already common for predicting difficulties like Tay-Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Gene editing to remove harmful mutations will likely become an elected choice, sparking societal debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. Experiments in China, like genetically modifying dogs for hyper-muscularity or rumored attempts to create "super soldiers," highlight the "wild west in genetics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Synthetic creation of gametes (gametogenesis) could allow for creating thousands of genetic variations outside the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
    *   **Nuclear Power:** Nuclear is considered the best low-carbon, baseload power source, not requiring cutting-edge technology but rather existing fission plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. It needs rebranding (e.g., "elemental power") to overcome the negative zeitgeist created by conflating nuclear power with nuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Its dangers are overstated; modern containment structures would have avoided Chernobyl's 4,000 deaths, and direct deaths from Fukushima are hard to attribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The argument that power plants can be easily turned into weapons is also dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The US is "pathetically behind" countries like Sweden and Russia in nuclear energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### The Influencer Investor Model
In an era where capital is increasingly commoditized, an investor's "edge" comes from adding value and putting their work out there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. This signals that they are "open for business" and a partner of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The rise of "influencer investors" stems from the evolution of communication mediums, from early internet bloggers to Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This trend democratizes access to investors, allowing founders to see who they are, what they care about, and their values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Building a credible, intellectually honest reputation is key, avoiding overly promotional "pumping" that can lead to misdirection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## New York City as a Tech Hub
New York City is seen as a "modern metropolis" experiencing a renaissance, characterized by "super linear scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. This means adding more people leads to disproportionately more patents, business activity, and creativity due to kinetic interactions and the flow of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. A flood of ambitious young people are repopulating neighborhoods, driving a cycle where artists, then hipsters, then techies, and then wealthy individuals create vibrant ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.

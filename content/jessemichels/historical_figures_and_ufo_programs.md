Investigating the involvement of esteemed scientists, military, and government personnel in UFO programs represents a critical pathway to disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Many of these figures have relatives still alive, and their involvement occurred in relatively recent history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Key Figures and Their Suspected Involvement

A lost timeline in American history reveals that top American military, government, and scientific brass were deeply involved with the UFO issue, studying it since 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. These programs were often intertwined with American atomic programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### The Australian Joint Intelligence Organization Memo (1971)

In 1971, Australia's CIA, the Australian Joint Intelligence Organization, released a memo written by Harry Turner, head of their nuclear division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Turner believed the US had misled other countries about its efforts in UFOs and anti-gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. While Project Blue Book (the official Air Force program) downplayed UFO sightings, Turner realized that true US inquiries into anti-gravity and UFOs went much deeper, with "real programs" designed to throw off public and international scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

This 1971 document comprehensively details US inquiries into anti-gravity and UFOs in the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. It lists involved scientists, academic outposts implicitly backed by the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence, and major aerospace companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

Notable scientists listed as deeply involved in anti-gravity research include:
*   [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Edward Teller]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>
*   [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Freeman Dyson]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>
*   [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Robert J. Oppenheimer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>

Aerospace companies mentioned:
*   Bell Aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>
*   Martin Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a> (pre-Lockheed Martin merger)
*   Lear Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>

### The "G-Engines Are Coming" Article (1956)

An article from *Young Men's Magazine* in 1956, titled "The G-engines are Coming," features quotes from top aerospace patrons exuding confidence that the US would "beat gravity" in the next five or six years, likening it to a second Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

*   **Lawrence Bell**: Stated his company was "working with nuclear fuels and equipment to cancel out gravity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **George S. Trimble**: Vice President of Martin Corporation's anti-gravity division (Research Institute for Advanced Study - RIAS), stated that beating gravity could be achieved in "about the time it took to build the first atom bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### UNC Chapel Hill Conference (1957)

In 1957, a conference at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, one of the CIA's academic outposts mentioned in the Australian memo, focused on gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

*   **Agnew Bonson**: Patron of the conference and author of a science fiction novel about a fake alien invasion perpetrated by men with anti-gravity crafts, was obsessed with beating gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Lewis Whitten**: Represented Martin Corporation's RIAS at the conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   Attendees included top theoretical physicists of the time: Bryce DeWitt, John Wheeler, Peter Bergman, and Richard Feynman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   The conference was sponsored by Wright Air Development Center, a top Air Force base, indicating military interest in theoretical physics related to anti-gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Wright Air Development Center (Wright-Patterson Air Force Base)

Wright Air Development Center (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) was deeply involved in anti-gravity research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

*   **Josh Goldberg**: Led the Aerospace Research Laboratory at Wright Air Development Center, with the sole mandate to figure out how to beat gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Senator Barry Goldwater**: In a 1994 Larry King interview, revealed he was denied access by General [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Curtis LeMay]] to a secret room at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where secret UFO-related technology was reportedly kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. This suggests the base held exotic technology requiring anti-gravity study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Possible explanations for Wright Airfield's interest in anti-gravity:

1.  **Nazi Tech Transfer**: There was a transfer of anti-gravity programs from Nazi Germany to Wright Airfield through Operation Paperclip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Nazi scientists, including Richard Miethe, Viktor Schauberger, and Henri CoandÄƒ, who worked under SS officer Hans Kammler's "Kammlerstab" on anti-gravity and UFO technology, ended up at Wright-Patterson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This supported projects like the Avrocar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
2.  **Thomas Townsend Brown's Experiments**: Physicist Thomas Townsend Brown conducted "gravitator experiments" that appeared to defy gravity using asymmetric capacitors and electromagnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
    *   [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Edward Teller]], inventor of the hydrogen bomb, was astounded by Brown's experiments, stating, "I don't know how this works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
    *   Air Force Chief of Staff [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Curtis LeMay]] witnessed Brown's experiments and showed intense interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
    *   Bill Lear, an aerospace titan, was a close collaborator and witness to Brown's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
    *   [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Agnew Bonson]] simultaneously funded the Chapel Hill conference and Brown's gravitator experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
    *   Victor Brandus, a technical representative from Wright Airfield, witnessed Brown's experiments and reported seeing what he believed was a "flying saucer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. Brandus worked for Colonel Albert Boyd, who ran Airfield's flight test division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
    *   Wright Airfield kept close tabs on Brown, with a technical consultant named Charles Wyatt Miller reportedly living with Brown's family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
    *   Brown's work was considered credible by the FBI, who identified him as the Navy's top radar expert in 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. There is evidence that Brown's work influenced the B2 stealth bomber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
3.  **Roswell Crash Material**: The base reportedly received a crashed disc and materials from the [[historical_ufo_incidents_and_evidence | Roswell incident]] in 1947, which included malleable "Memory Metal" with strange hieroglyphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Wright Airfield was known for reverse engineering adversary technology, and was an early center for nuclear propulsion in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

### The Twining Memo (1947)

General Nathan Twining, head of Air Material Command, wrote in 1947 that UFOs were "real" and not fictitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. He described their attributes, such as no vapor trails, extreme rates of climb and maneuverability, and no visible propulsion, aligning with modern UAP observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

Crucially, Twining's postscript stated that it was "possible within present US knowledge" to construct a piloted aircraft with these attributes, but it would require an "extremely expensive, time-consuming" Manhattan Project-style effort, set up "independently of existing projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. This suggests a desire for a deeply covert program insulated from civilian oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

### UFO Secrecy Protocols

The concept of a Manhattan Project-style secrecy for UFOs aligns with whistleblower revelations from David Grusch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. Grusch claims that [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Robert J. Oppenheimer]] and Robert Sarbacher were responsible for setting up UFO secrecy protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. They were involved in the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, which designated any material emitting radioactive properties as "born secret," thus linking UFO materials with nuclear secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. This is significant given the correlation of UFO sightings with nuclear bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.

### Marginalization of UFOs by Atomic Physicists

UFOs were marginalized and dismissed as "quacky" by physicists tied to atomic programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.

*   **H.P. Robertson**: A physicist tied to American atomic programs and on the National Defense Research Council under FDR, was instrumental in creating the mandate for Project Blue Book via the Robertson Panel in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. This panel intentionally minimized, downplayed, and rationalized away UFO sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.
*   **Edward Condon**: Was very close with [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Robert J. Oppenheimer]] and helped select Los Alamos for the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. He lost his security clearance in 1953-54 under mysterious circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. Condon authored the McMahon Secrecy Act of 1946, a precursor to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>. From 1966 to 1969, Condon led the "Condon Committee," which was reportedly rigged to debunk UFOs and conclude that all US research into them was a waste of resources, effectively being the "nail in the coffin" for public UFO research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

### Henry Kissinger and Havana Syndrome

The historical record also shows serious figures like [[historical_figures_and_their_involvement_in_ufo_secrecy | Henry Kissinger]] taking phenomena, now known as Havana Syndrome, seriously, despite its past dismissal as "science fiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. During Salt II talks, Kissinger discussed with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that microwave beams were causing illnesses at the US Embassy in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>. This illustrates how initially dismissed phenomena can later be corroborated by historical evidence, serving as an analogy for UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

Dr. Wernher von Braun, known as the "grandfather of the Space Program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> and also a Nazi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> and "rocket genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, requested a meeting with the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The speaker's curiosity led them to accept the invitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Unidentified Metal Examination

During the encounter, Wernher von Braun presented two distinct pieces of metal for examination:

1.  **First Piece of Metal**
    Von Braun initially presented a piece of metal, asking the speaker to touch it and describe their sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Upon touching it, the speaker remarked, "wow it doesn't feel like it's from here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

2.  **Second Piece of Metal (UFO Material)**
    Following this, von Braun escorted the speaker into his personal office, where a safe was located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He opened the safe and revealed a second piece of metal, whose color the speaker had never seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Von Braun noted that it was not heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> before asking the speaker to touch it and share their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The speaker, upon contact, definitively stated, "Wernher this is not from here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Von Braun then confirmed that this was a piece of a [[historical_ufo_incidents_and_evidence | UFO]] that had crashed on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The speaker described being "mind blown" by this revelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, particularly given their childhood interest in [[alleged_extraterrestrial_encounters_and_abductions | extraterrestrial life]] through films seen in Tel Aviv movie theaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

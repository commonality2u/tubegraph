In 1977, Mario Woods, a former US Air Force Security responder, experienced an incident at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota that profoundly altered his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Stationed at the time, the then 23-year-old was left with missing time, physical marks, and a partner in a catatonic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This event highlights a recurring theme of [[connection_between_ufos_and_nuclear_technology | UFO sightings and nuclear connection]] that raises questions about global security and the unknown.

## The Ellsworth Air Force Base Incident (1977)

Mario Woods served in the Air Force from 1975 to 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. In November 1977, he was part of the Security Police assigned to the missile squadron at Ellsworth Air Force Base, which housed 150 Minuteman II 1.2 Megaton weapons in hardened silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. His role involved acting as a response team for alarms and performing police-type duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. As part of the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) for sensitive nuclear equipment, Woods underwent deep psychological analysis and regular physical tests to ensure his reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He had no prior mental health history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

On the night of the incident, Mario Woods and his partner, Michael Johnson, were working the night shift (6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Initial Sighting and Interaction
Around 9:00-9:15 p.m., while outside for a cigarette in 9-13 degree Fahrenheit weather, Woods observed a pulsating light to his East, resembling a "mini moon" at about a 30-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. He initially thought it was a B-52 bomber, which often flew low-level test runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The object, estimated to be five to seven miles away, made no noise and remained stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Curious, Woods entered the facility and, with permission from Staff Sergeant Bill Hollman, flickered the external lights at the object three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. A minute and a half later, the object responded by flickering its own lights, sending "shivers" through Woods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. He then brought Michael Johnson outside to witness the phenomenon. Johnson, though not as impressed, confirmed seeing the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Woods repeated the light sequence twice more, and each time the object responded, though the last response involved it moving slightly northward and westward before disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The entire interaction lasted until around 9:35-9:40 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### The November 5 Missile Site Alarm
At approximately 12:50 a.m., the alert phone rang, indicating a "two-pronged alarm" at November 5, a Minute Man 2 missile site, signifying both an above-ground and below-ground sensor had been affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Woods and Johnson departed around 12:20-12:25 a.m. in their F-150 pickup truck, heading to the site, which was about 8.5-10 miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

En route, Woods spotted a pulsating orange, yellow, and white glow coming from the ground where November 5 was located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. As they made a "dog leg left" turn near the site, they saw the object: a massive sphere, the size of a Walmart building, hovering about 10 feet above the missile's blast door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. It had a moving energy source around it, like a "boiling" sun, but no discernible features like tail sections, thrusters, or port holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

### The Encounter and Missing Time
Upon pulling the truck within 60 feet of the object, an intense light "blew my eyeballs out of my head," followed by the atmosphere vacating, making it impossible to breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Woods, panicking, prayed for relief and then used his flashlight to flash at the object again. As he slid back into his seat, dust particles in the cab seemed to move in slow motion like "glitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Michael Johnson remained frozen, bathed in a blue-white light, glued to the steering wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

A black, beach-ball-sized sphere with vents then shot down over the truck's hood, bouncing around the vehicle before disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. A strong, overwhelming "ammonia-like" stench permeated the vehicle, causing Woods a "strange feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Woods began to experience tunnel vision and felt like he was going to pass out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. As he blacked out, he saw four "beings" gliding near the truck; three were small and uniform, while the fourth was a "chest and a head taller" and had a pulsating yellow tip on a wand at its waist belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. Woods experienced fear before blacking out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

When Woods regained consciousness, Michael Johnson was still catatonic, and the missile site, with its lights, was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. They were now at New Lake Reservoir Dam, 8 to 8.5 miles away from November 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. Their two-wheel-drive truck was perfectly positioned to exit the muddy area, despite it having snowed earlier and them leaving no tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. Woods realized over six hours of time were missing, as it was past 6:00 a.m. when he looked at his watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.

### Aftermath and Investigation
Search teams, including three military alert teams (six security policemen) and two Deputy Sheriffs from Sturgis, along with a state trooper, eventually located them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Sergeant Garza, one of the first responders, showed no immediate concern about the catatonic state of Michael Johnson, only offering an escort back to November Control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. Michael Johnson remained catatonic, requiring assistance to be moved, and did not speak a single word throughout the entire ordeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

Upon returning to the base, Woods was separated from Johnson and underwent an intense debriefing for almost two hours with his commander, Colonel Spraker, the Deputy Base Commander, and OSI (Office of Special Investigations) agents, including Rick Dodie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. Woods deliberately omitted seeing the "beings" from his report to avoid losing his Personal Reliability Program (PRP) clearance and his job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.

After the debriefing, Woods was sent to the flight surgeon's office for a medical examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>. Doctors examined his ears, eyes, nose, throat, and joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>. Unusually, they paid particular attention to his gums and teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. They also noted two burn marks, one above his right eye and another on the back of his right hand, and took skin samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.

Woods was made to sign a non-disclosure agreement, classifying the incident and prohibiting him from speaking to media or even his wife about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. Rick Dodie's stated role was to collect their medical records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. Dodie was later known for a psychological operation on researcher Paul Bennewitz related to UFOs at Kirtland Air Force Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

Roughly three weeks later, Michael Johnson, now coherent but still reserved, visited Woods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. They independently drew what they saw, and their drawings of the craft and the black sphere were "exact same pictures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>. Johnson also confirmed smelling the odor and hearing the "do not fear" message telepathically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. After this meeting, Michael Johnson disappeared, and Woods has been unable to locate him despite extensive efforts, including contacting other law enforcement and the AARO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:38">[01:55:38]</a>.

## Wider Context and Implications

This incident is not isolated, echoing other [[the_connection_between_ufos_and_nuclear_sites | UFO sightings and their connection to nuclear sites worldwide]]. There were rumors of similar incidents at Ellsworth AFB prior to 1977, including two security policemen found unclothed in the Badlands area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. There were also talks of F-86 jets being used to chase objects away from B-52 bombers at Ellsworth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>.

The seemingly routine nature of the military's response to such a high-stakes incident suggests a pattern of known occurrences, rather than a novel event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. The phenomenon appears to have a strong interest in [[ufos_and_nuclear_weaponry_connections_during_the_cold_war | nuclear weaponry connections during the Cold War]], potentially targeting not only nuclear weapons but also nuclear energy and materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. Woods speculates the intelligence behind these events might be gauging human knowledge of atomic fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>.

A "sense of humor" is attributed to the phenomenon, as it can stop missile countdowns (as seen in the Robert Salas incident) but also trigger false alarms, forcing military responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. A standing order during a missile launch countdown was to drive a truck onto the blast door to damage the rocket and offset its guidance control, which would be rendered useless if an object were to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.

Woods believes that one out of every four security policemen at nuclear missile sites like Ellsworth has likely witnessed something unusual in the night sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">[02:00:23]</a>. The "two-man rule" at nuclear facilities ensures personnel are never alone, but incidents like Johnson's catatonic state demonstrate this rule's limitations in such encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:06">[02:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:10">[02:00:10]</a>.

## Long-term Effects and Personal Insights

### Physiological and Psychological Impacts
Mario Woods has experienced significant health issues, including atrial fibrillation (apib), which he attributes to the hypnotic regression of his experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[01:51:01]</a>. He developed apib after his first regression and re-entered it after thinking about the incident, leading to him being put on medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

His hypnotic regression sessions provided vivid details of the incident. Inside the craft, which resembled a "beehive" with multiple levels and small "Grays" moving about, Woods felt himself held in a "triangular kind of beam" about four feet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:35">[01:32:35]</a>. A "tall gray" being performed a procedure on his wrist that caused pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:19">[01:33:19]</a>. He received a telepathic message: "Do not fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>. The experience felt physical and real, not dreamlike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:40">[01:36:40]</a>. He also recalls being shown a room resembling an antique shop, filled with old objects like a sewing machine and a wooden box radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>.

The physical marks on his body, two small indentations on his lower right leg, are of an unknown origin, described by his doctor as not consistent with any known life-saving event or accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:06">[01:41:06]</a>. They are the same depth and size, with a "little dimple" in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:23">[01:41:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>. These marks align with other [[encounters_with_alleged_ufo_materials | alleged UFO materials]] and implants found on abductees.

Years after the incident, Woods experienced electromagnetic effects at his home, including flickering lights and alarms from appliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:11">[01:54:11]</a>. His power was disrupted, and Georgia Power noted his house "lit up our board downtown like the Fourth of July" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:03">[01:57:03]</a>. A neighbor reported his backyard was "lit up like a Hollywood set" at 4:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:40">[01:58:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a>.

### Philosophical and Existential Shifts
The encounter sparked a profound interest in archaeology and pyramids, feeling as though information was "downloaded" into him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:11">[01:27:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:19">[01:27:19]</a>. He views pyramids as ancient power generators for worldwide use, supporting theories by Christopher Dunn and Robert Schoch about advanced ancient technology and astronomical alignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>. He believes these ancient megalithic structures could have been "celestial ascent chambers" or "Stargates" acting as portals to other worlds, especially during cataclysmic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:37">[01:43:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:47">[01:43:47]</a>.

Woods describes the entities he saw as "Grays," with one being a "tall gray" similar to descriptions in Whitley Strieber's "Communion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:06">[01:46:06]</a>. He ponders whether these beings are from another dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:19">[01:31:19]</a>. He believes their intentions are positive but that they fulfill their mission regardless of human comfort, perhaps to obtain DNA or conduct programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>.

His experience transformed his worldview, opening his mind to what is possible and prompting him to question long-held beliefs, though not his faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:42">[02:19:42]</a>. He believes the phenomenon emanates a wave or energy that might induce thoughts or ideas in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:51">[02:20:51]</a>.

### Family Connections to the Phenomenon
Woods' own initial interest in rockets and space came from a childhood [[ufo_sightings_and_nuclear_connection | UFO sighting]] in Port Arthur, Texas, in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:31">[02:15:31]</a>. At five or six years old, he, his sister, and mother witnessed three white, silver, dome-shaped crafts hovering silently over a church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:21">[02:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:03">[02:17:03]</a>. His mother, who had seen similar things before, calmly reassured them, saying, "They're not here to hurt you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:52">[02:17:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:47">[02:21:47]</a>. The objects then ascended straight up and vanished instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:35">[02:18:35]</a>. Notably, everyone on the playground and in the school returned to normal immediately, as if nothing had happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:51">[02:18:51]</a>. This suggests a broader [[impact_of_ufos_on_religion_and_society | impact of UFOs on society]].

His father, a merchant seaman from Honduras, also witnessed UAPs, including an entire crew observing something exit the water and bolt into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The phenomenon of sighting these objects and having weird experiences often runs in families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:36">[02:23:36]</a>.

Woods hopes his testimony contributes to understanding and reducing fear, emphasizing that if these beings intended harm, it would have happened long ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:47">[01:59:47]</a>. He advocates for a future without war, driven by differences in belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a>. His story underscores the enduring mystery and [[the_role_of_nuclear_secrecy_in_ufo_secrecy | nuclear secrecy in UFO secrecy]].

Every cell in the human body contains a genetic code called DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This DNA is not static; if it were, all cells in the body would appear and behave identically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. What distinguishes cells, such as brain cells from liver cells, is a process known as DNA methylation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## The Process of DNA Methylation

DNA methylation involves a methyl group attaching to a specific genetic sequence on a DNA strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This attachment effectively "turns off" that particular genetic sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. As a result, different cell types are formed, determined by which genetic sequences are activated or deactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

While an individual is born with a static DNA sequence that remains the same in every cell of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>, DNA methylation represents a chemical modification of the DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. These modifications modulate genes, instructing them whether to be turned on or off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This mechanism is crucial for cell identity, for example, telling neurons they are neurons and blood cells they are blood cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. These chemical modifications can also occur in response to factors like stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

## Role in Cell Differentiation and Development

Epigenetics, through processes like DNA methylation, plays a fundamental role in cell differentiation and the formation of cells from a more primordial stem cell state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. Without methylation, a stem cell would be unable to differentiate into other cell types, tissues, and organs, making proper development impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## Connection to Aging

Beyond differentiation, DNA methylation patterns are remarkably consistent in their rate of change, especially after age 20 in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. This consistent pace of methylation across nearly all mammalian species correlates with age, almost as if each species is pre-programmed to die within a general age range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This phenomenon has led to the development of [[epigenetic_clocks_and_their_role_in_aging_and_predicting_death | epigenetic clocks]], which use an individual's DNA methylation profile to estimate their biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a> and even predict mortality risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The "GrimAge clock" is an example of a mortality risk predictor based on this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

However, the precise reasons for this constant velocity of the "epigenetic clock" after development are not yet fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Researchers are still investigating whether DNA methylation causes aging, or simply correlates with it, and why a process vital for cell differentiation might also be linked to mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

## Future Research

While current [[advancements_in_longevity_research_and_antiaging_interventions | longevity research]] primarily focuses on cytosine methylation due to technological readiness and cost-effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>, there is a recognized "missed opportunity" in not extensively studying histone modifications, which are more dynamic and could offer different insights into the aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. Investigating these modifications could lead to [[developments_in_epigenetic_reprogramming_and_potential_therapies | new anti-aging treatments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

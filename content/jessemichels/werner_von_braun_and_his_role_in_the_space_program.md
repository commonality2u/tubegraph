[[werner_von_brauns_beliefs_in_extraterrestrial_life | Werner Von Braun]] is recognized as the "grandfather of the [[the_intersection_of_science_and_esoterica_in_space_programs | Space Program]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> and was known as a "rocket genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Despite awareness of his past as a Nazi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, his scientific contributions were highly regarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Meeting with Uri Geller

[[uri_geller_meeting_with_werner_von_braun | Werner Von Braun]] sought a meeting with [[uri_geller_meeting_with_werner_von_braun | Uri Geller]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. During their encounter, [[werner_von_brauns_beliefs_in_extraterrestrial_life | Von Braun]] presented Geller with a piece of metal, asking him to describe what he felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Geller reported that it didn't feel as though it was "from here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Subsequently, [[werner_von_brauns_beliefs_in_extraterrestrial_life | Von Braun]] led Geller into his personal office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, where he opened a safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Inside, he revealed another piece of metal, which Geller described as having an unprecedented color and being light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. When Geller touched this second piece, he again stated that it was "not from here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Beliefs on Extraterrestrial Life and UFOs

It was at this point that [[werner_von_brauns_beliefs_in_extraterrestrial_life | Werner Von Braun]] confirmed Geller's intuition, asserting, "You're right, this is a piece of a [[reverseengineered_technology_and_black_programs | UFO]] that crashed on our planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This revelation was particularly impactful for Geller, who had a childhood interest in films about [[werner_von_brauns_beliefs_in_extraterrestrial_life | extraterrestrial life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, and this statement came directly "from the mouth of [[werner_von_brauns_beliefs_in_extraterrestrial_life | Werner V Brown]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

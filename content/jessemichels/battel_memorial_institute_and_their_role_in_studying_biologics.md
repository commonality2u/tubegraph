The Battelle Memorial Institute is identified as a primary group studying actual biologics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They operate a [[fort_dietrichs_biological_materials_lab | biological materials lab]] out of [[fort_dietrichs_biological_materials_lab | Fort Dietrich]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Classified Work and UFO Studies

In addition to their biologics research, Battelle Memorial Institute conducts significant classified work at Dougway Proving Grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

It has been suggested that the study of UFOs saw a "cleaving off" where public-facing investigations, like Project Blue Book, were handled by the Air Force, while all private, classified work was managed by Battelle Memorial Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This classified work fell under the Atomic Energy Commission, established in 1954, preceded by the McMahon Secrecy Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Advanced Materials Research

Robert Sarbacher reportedly informed Whitley Strieber about materials he worked on at the Battelle Memorial Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. With the advent of operative electron microscopes, researchers at Battelle discovered a "molecular grid" or "designed grid" within a very thin material, which contributed to its exceptional strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It is believed that this understanding has since been extrapolated into various forms of military technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

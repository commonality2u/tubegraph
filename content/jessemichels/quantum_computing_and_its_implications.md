Quantum computing is an emerging field that seeks to leverage the principles of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] to solve complex computational problems [00:08:11]. Unlike classical computers that treat quantum effects as side effects, quantum computers are designed to manipulate and leverage quantum systems to simulate other quantum systems [00:08:04]. The goal is to simulate nature, which is inherently quantum mechanical, using a system that is also quantum mechanical [00:08:32].

## Deep Prasad and Quantum Generative Materials

Deep Prasad, a 26-year-old, is at the forefront of this field with his startup, Quantum Generative Materials [00:00:08]. The company has raised $15 million with a mission to [[reverse_engineering_ufos_using_quantum_computers | reverse engineer UFOs]] using quantum computers [00:00:10]. Prasad believes that due to numerous anomalies around the world, such phenomena cannot be ignored [00:00:20].

## Understanding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs)

The Pentagon has recorded hundreds of instances of optical, radar, and infrared detections of UFOs, which exhibit five consistent observable properties [00:00:31]. These properties include sudden and instantaneous acceleration and hypersonic velocity with no signatures [00:00:45]. According to Eric Weinstein, these observations suggest "wholly new physics" rather than just new engineering [00:00:51]. Prasad posits that if visitation is taken seriously, it implies that Einstein's theories are not the final word [00:00:59].

Prasad believes that these five observables indicate UAPs engage in quantum macroscopic behavior [00:01:10]. While [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum physics]] typically governs the properties of very small things like atoms, photons, and electrons, which exhibit "spooky" phenomena like entanglement and wave-particle duality [00:01:17], Prasad suggests that UAPs could be large, macroscopic quantum objects [00:01:35]. He argues that UAPs might be made of more advanced materials whose emergent properties cannot be modeled with today's physics and mathematics [00:01:39].

## The Role of Quantum Computers in Materials Science

Prasad's initial goal in quantum computing was to simulate any new material and predict its properties before it needed to be made in a lab [00:06:32]. This involves determining if a new combination of atoms could form a semiconductor, solar cell, or battery [00:06:39]. He envisions quantum computing as the ultimate modeling software, akin to what Nikola Tesla could do in his brain [00:06:51].

To simulate material properties, scientists traditionally use the Schrödinger's many-body equation [00:07:01]. Solving this equation would reveal everything about a material, including its speed of sound, resonance frequency, heat capacity, and strength [00:07:11]. However, classical computers can only solve this equation for about three atoms due to a "scaling problem" [00:07:21]. As Paul Dirac stated, everything needed to know about materials is known, but the computational resources to solve the equation are lacking [00:07:33]. Prasad believes that [[quantum_computing_and_its_implications | quantum computing]] can overcome this bottleneck, allowing for the simulation of metamaterials exhibiting the five observable properties of UFOs [00:07:43].

### Qubits and Information Storage

The fundamental unit of information in a quantum system is a qubit, the quantum version of a classical computer's bit [00:10:16]. While a classical bit is either a 0 or a 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of states [00:10:23]. This means that while it's not simultaneously 0 and 1, it exists in a state that encompasses possibilities [00:10:40].

This property significantly enhances information storage capacity [00:10:59]. For example, 10 classical bits require 10 bits to describe their state, but 10 qubits require 2 to the power of 10 classical bits to represent their entire quantum state [00:11:06]. This is because qubits can be entangled, meaning describing one requires describing all the others [00:11:22]. To fully describe 97 entangled electrons in a caffeine molecule, 2 to the power of 97 classical bits would be needed, which is more atoms than on the entire surface of Earth [00:11:31].

Nature's ability to "bookkeep" quantum states is computationally impossible for humans today [00:12:12]. While theories like the multiverse interpretation suggest these states are distributed across different universes [00:12:28], the exact mechanism by which quantum computers store this information remains a "black box" [00:12:49].

## Challenges in Building Quantum Hardware

Quantum hardware is incredibly sensitive [00:09:16]. Subatomic particles exist in a probabilistic state of many possibilities, but collapse into a single state upon interaction with an observer [00:08:53]. This phenomenon, called decoherence, means that quantum hardware relying on superposition will lose its quantum state if interfered with by outside elements [00:09:02]. This sensitivity, often requiring specific and energy-intensive environments, is the main bottleneck for building fully functional quantum computers [00:09:12]. Consequently, Deep Prasad initially uses a quantum computer simulator rather than physical quantum hardware [00:09:24].

Despite these challenges, quantum computers are universal computations, meaning they can model any algorithm [00:09:31]. This allows for the mathematical representation of the many-body Schrödinger equation to be ported onto a quantum computer [00:09:47].

## Broader Implications of Quantum Computing

### Medical Applications and Quantum Sensing

Every physical material, including the human body, is a quantum system, as all atoms are described by [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanical]] rules [00:13:03]. It is naive to assume the body is not quantum when everything else is [00:13:13]. Scientists are discovering that parts of biology exhibit quantum effects, despite typically being warm, wet, and noisy environments that challenge quantum coherence [00:14:30].

An example of biological quantum sensing is found in robins, which use a protein called cryptochrome (Cry4) in their eyes to sense the Earth's magnetic field for navigation [00:14:44]. Electron pairs in the Cry4 protein arrange themselves based on the robin's position, directing the bird based on the magnetic field [00:15:01]. Lockheed successfully replicated this biological GPS using existing sensors, creating the "Dark Ice Magnetometer" six years ago, which allows navigation anywhere on Earth with GPS precision without relying on satellites [00:15:10].

As more powerful [[challenges_and_potential_uses_of_quantum_sensors | quantum sensors]] are developed, they will enable medical breakthroughs, such as atomic resolution imaging of the human body and detailed sensing of heart activity [00:16:01].

### Impact on Encryption and Cybersecurity

Quantum computers are predicted to become powerful enough within 15 years to render RSA encryption obsolete [00:28:53]. RSA encryption is the backbone of society, enabling secure access to bank accounts and messages [00:29:03]. This means quantum computers could potentially reverse-engineer and break current encryption methods [00:29:10].

This development would also make most cryptocurrencies obsolete, as quantum computing could facilitate double-spending and expose all transactional data [00:29:18]. This is an inevitable "black swan event" that will catch many off guard [00:29:33]. The emergence of nation-state actors or individuals capable of building quantum computers could expose the world's information, leading to a loss of leverage for everyone and potentially forcing global cooperation [00:29:42].

### [[artificial_intelligence_and_quantum_technology | Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Technology]]

If quantum computers didn't exist, Deep Prasad states he would work in [[artificial_intelligence_and_quantum_technology | artificial intelligence]] [00:26:51]. He believes AI will become generative and not require humans to feed it ideal end states when machine learning models improve beyond current neural networks and when AI has its own physical body, enabling interaction with the world [00:27:09].

Prasad disagrees with the doomsday scenarios of sentient killer robots envisioned by figures like Elon Musk and Nick Bostrom, considering it an "insane leap of logic" from current "statistics on steroids" AI [00:27:21]. Instead, he views the more insidious narrative as AI already "killing us" through consumer apps like TikTok, which manipulate users without their knowledge [00:27:51]. He cites past Facebook experiments where news feed manipulation affected people's moods and potentially led to increased suicides [00:28:22]. He warns that AI is "eating away at us parasitically" [00:28:46].

### The Evolution of Science and the Interactive Universe

Prasad argues that the modern scientific method, attributed to Sir Francis Bacon, assumes the universe is static and repeatable [00:16:57]. However, the existence of anomalies like the Tic-Tac UAP, which is not repeatable yet clearly needs study, suggests the scientific method requires modification [00:17:53].

He aligns with a Kuhnian model of science, where anomalies, like black-body radiation that defied Newtonian physics before Max Planck's quantum theory, serve as "little pokes" in the formal convention and standard paradigm [00:18:15]. Studying anomalies is crucial as they can be "harbingers of the next paradigm" [00:19:21]. Ignoring them by over-indexing on justifying the current paradigm does not advance science or face reality [00:19:31]. Prasad emphasizes that the universe is not static, and there's a non-zero chance of encountering crazy anomalies that demand new methods for quantification and accounting [00:20:03].

Deep Prasad suggests that the reason certain people see UAPs could be part of a larger "cellular automata" game, where seemingly individual, weird events are part of a complex emergent phenomenon [00:21:26]. This suggests humanity might be part of a more intelligent organism's cellular automata game, pushing society towards a new, complex state [00:22:28]. This could explain synchronized discoveries or the idea that technology is more preordained than thought, or that ideas are "zapped into us" (William James' transmission theory of consciousness) [00:23:07].

### Future Predictions

Prasad predicts that within 10 years, enough scientific and post-scientific evidence will be collected to acknowledge that humans are not the only intelligent and super-intelligent life forms on Earth [00:24:28]. This shift could integrate science with traditionally religious or folkloric narratives, making the world seem more magical [00:25:08]. He believes this is inevitable due to the growing number of reported and measured anomalies globally [00:25:55]. It is "painfully naive" to conclude that humanity knows everything about the universe when current physics (quantum mechanics and general relativity) only describes 5% of it [00:26:16]. He warns against mistaking the map for the territory [00:26:40].

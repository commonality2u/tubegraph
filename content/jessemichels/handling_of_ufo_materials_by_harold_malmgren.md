Harold Malmgren, a distinguished presidential advisor to four US presidents (JFK, LBJ, Nixon, and Ford), gained significant attention for his unique claims regarding [[encounters_with_alleged_ufo_materials | direct handling of UFO materials]] and his involvement in high-level discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>. His revelations, shared shortly before his passing, offer an extraordinary glimpse into government secrecy and the long history of interaction with UAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:43">[07:47:43]</a>.

## Early Life and Identification

Born in the midst of the Great Depression to Swedish immigrants, Malmgren grew up in modest circumstances, learning to fish and work from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>. His exceptional intellect was recognized early on when, at the age of 13 or 14, he was discovered by Carl Compton, then president of MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a>. Malmgren displayed an astonishing understanding of physics concepts, even those not yet experimentally proven, such as entangled photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. His knowledge came from extensive reading, including correspondence with the Atomic Energy Agency about nuclear physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.

This early identification by figures like Compton, who was himself briefed on UFO technology, suggests Malmgren was on a pre-selected path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:40">[01:57:40]</a>. His name appeared in "all the important books of talent" that tracked individuals of particular proclivity for organizations like the CIA and the "Majestic" guardians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:19">[03:41:19]</a>.

## Role in the Cuban Missile Crisis

Malmgren's rapid ascent led him to become a 27-year-old joint liaison between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President's National Security Council under Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>. His critical mission was to "slow down" aggressive military strategists, particularly General Curtis LeMay, by asking questions and reducing tension, ultimately helping to avert nuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>. Malmgren's suggestion that striking Moscow would leave "no one to talk to" caused LeMay to storm out of the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. This success further cemented his reputation as a unique and effective figure in national security.

## The Bluegill Triple Prime Test and UFO Encounter

In the immediate aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Malmgren was tasked with devising outlines for an anti-missile system, specifically focusing on cost assessments for the Bluegill tests, part of Operation Dominic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>. These nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands explored high-energy X-rays to counter incoming missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.

During the Bluegill Triple Prime test in October 1962, Malmgren received a report describing an unidentified object that appeared on the screen and "tagged along" with the incoming missile before being knocked down by the X-ray blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. This object was casually referred to as a "tagalong" by military personnel, indicating a familiarity with such phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.

### Direct Handling of UFO Material

Malmgren, holding the highest Q clearances for nuclear information, demanded to know more about the "tagalong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. His persistence led him to Los Alamos, where he met Lawrence Keys, head of the Atomic Energy Commission's Albuquerque division, and the maternal grandfather by adoption of Jeff Bezos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

Lawrence Keys directly presented Malmgren with pieces of the recovered UFO material, describing them as "things that have come down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>. Malmgren was allowed to handle the material, which felt "weird because it didn't feel anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>. He noted that the objects felt "heavy" but then "went through the heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. While holding the material, Malmgren reported hearing words in his head, a form of telepathic communication, suggesting the material implanted ideas into his subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>. He later confirmed that the entire Bluegill shootdown was an intentional attempt to down a UFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>.

The incident at Los Alamos was deemed so significant that President Kennedy, Vice President Johnson, and their teams visited Los Alamos just two weeks after Malmgren's briefingâ€”an unprecedented visit for a sitting president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

## Richard Bissell's Briefing on "Otherworld Technologies"

Following the Bluegill incident, Malmgren received a full briefing on "otherworld technologies" from Richard Bissell, Deputy Director of Plans for the CIA and a key architect of Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:47">[02:44:47]</a>. Bissell confirmed to Malmgren the existence of the [[ufo_crash_retrieval | 1933 Magenta UFO crash]] in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:33">[03:19:33]</a>. This corroborates recent claims by [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | UFO whistleblower David Grusch]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:33">[03:19:33]</a>.

Bissell also implied that the very idea of using directed energy to shoot down UFOs, as seen in the Bluegill test, originated from an extraterrestrial being that survived the 1947 [[ufo_crash_retrieval | Roswell crash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:09:57]</a>. Malmgren later claimed to have seen a video of this creature being interviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:23">[02:11:23]</a>.

Bissell explained that UFOs presented forces beyond the CIA's knowledge or control, often interfering with government or private industry technology development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a>. He stated that UFOs are "generically attracted to the tip of the spear as far as tech development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Connections

### Tesla, Towns and Brown, and Anti-Gravity
Malmgren revealed that he had uncovered information from foreign intelligence sources about a collaboration between Nikola [[research_on_ufo_materials_and_isotopes | Tesla]] and Thomas Townsend Brown related to anti-gravity motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:09">[02:40:09]</a>. Tesla's work on electricity and its application to physical movement, possibly even "transmutation of elements," was considered far ahead of its time and has been largely suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:33">[02:57:33]</a>.

### Government Secrecy and Classified Science
Malmgren indicated that the most advanced scientific research in the US occurs not in universities but in Department of Energy (DOE) national labs, hidden under classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:02">[02:51:02]</a>. He noted that areas of physics were literally "classified math" in the nuclear era, preventing public access and traditional academic advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:03">[02:59:03]</a>. This deliberate compartmentalization, often via private contractors, allows for plausible deniability and limits civilian oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:03">[02:59:03]</a>.

Malmgren observed that some technologies appear to have "no onramp," meaning no discoverable research history, suggesting they may have originated from undisclosed sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:57">[02:56:57]</a>.

### JFK and UFOs
Malmgren believed that JFK was fully aware of UFOs long before becoming president, having been briefed by James Forrestal, former Secretary of the Navy and first Secretary of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:39">[02:19:39]</a>. He speculated that JFK's desire to openly share UFO knowledge with the Soviets and reduce nuclear arsenals was "probably the number one issue" that led to his assassination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:56">[02:17:56]</a>. This aligns with claims that JFK sought to coordinate with Russia on "unknowns" in sensitive airspace to avoid mistaken acts of aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:35">[02:16:35]</a>.

### Knights of Malta and Deep Politics
Malmgren hinted at a pervasive "deep politics" beyond public awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:52">[03:11:52]</a>. He asserted that the Knights of Malta, a secret society with historical ties to the Vatican and diplomatic immunity, played a role in UFO secrecy, particularly concerning the [[transportation_of_ufo_technology_to_the_us | 1933 Magenta crash retrieval]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:33">[03:19:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:54">[03:40:54]</a>. He described the Vatican's involvement in relaying information about the Magenta craft to the Allies, which led to its [[transportation_of_ufo_technology_to_the_us | transfer to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:15">[03:38:15]</a>.

## Harold Malmgren's Purpose and Legacy

Malmgren felt that his life was "guided" and that he had a "purpose" related to these interconnected, unexpected events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:15">[03:40:15]</a>. He believed his unusual understanding of advanced physics and his placement in critical national security roles were part of this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:43">[03:47:43]</a>.

He highlighted the "fear" in official circles regarding UFOs, primarily due to a lack of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:06">[03:28:06]</a>. Malmgren suggested that Western nations' "Cartesian split" between science and mysticism hinders their understanding compared to countries like China, Russia, and India, who approach these phenomena holistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:16">[03:29:16]</a>. He feared a "catastrophic disclosure" if China or other nations were to announce their own discoveries related to non-human intelligence first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:56">[03:31:56]</a>.

Malmgren's final interviews, conducted days before his death, served as an act of service to humanity, revealing profound information about UFOs, deep politics, and global power structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:01">[08:06:01]</a>. His insights suggest a reality far more complex and interconnected than commonly understood, where UAP interactions may be linked to global stability, geopolitical power dynamics, and even the future of human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:42">[03:38:42]</a>.

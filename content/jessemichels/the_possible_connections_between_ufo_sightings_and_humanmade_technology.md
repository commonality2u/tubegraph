For decades, the idea of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) has often been associated with extraterrestrial phenomena. However, evidence suggests a deep, formerly unknown history of human inquiry into advanced propulsion systems, including anti-gravity technologies, that might explain some [[technological_revolutions_and_scientific_exploration_of_UFOs | UFO sightings]] as secret man-made crafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This hidden history is explored through the work of Nick Cook, former aviation editor for Jane's Defence Weekly, in his comprehensive book *The Hunt for Zero Point* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of Inquiry: An Aerospace Secret
In 1994, Nick Cook stumbled upon a strange 1956 magazine article titled "The G Engines Are Coming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This article featured aerospace giants like Lear, Convair, Bell, and the Martin Corporation expressing "extreme confidence" in developing anti-gravity aircraft within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. George S. Trimble, then VP of Martin Corporation's Research Institute for Advanced Study, even claimed human control of gravity could be achieved in about the same time it took to build the first atom bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Yet, by the early 1960s, these "G engines" or weightless craft were non-existent publicly, and the industry went silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

Cook's attempt to interview Trimble years later was met with a stark refusal, leaving Trimble "scared" and prompting Cook's deeper investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This journalistic curiosity led him to uncover a secretive "black world" of classified stealth and supersonic aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Early Evidence of Human-Made Aerial Phenomena

### General Twining's Memo
In 1947, General Nathan Twining, head of the Air Material Command, penned the famous "Twining Memo," stating that the wave of [[History and impact of UFO sightings and materials | UFO sightings and materials]] in America were "something real and not visionary or fictitious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. He described disc-shaped objects with metallic or light-reflecting surfaces, no jet trails, and no propulsion sound, exhibiting "extreme rates of climb [and] maneuverability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. Crucially, Twining's postscript noted, "It is within our present knowledge to build these sorts of crafts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>, with a range that surpassed even future spy planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

### World War II "Foo Fighters" and "Ghost Rockets"
During WWII, Allied and Axis pilots reported seeing "Foo Fighters"—seemingly controlled ball lightning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. By 1946, "Swedish ghost rockets" appeared, prompting Eisenhower to send General James Doolittle to investigate these V2-like rockets flying at impossible speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.

## Nazi Germany's "Wonder Weapons" (Wunderwaffen)
Cook's investigation led him to Europe, focusing on the rumored secret weapons program under SS officer Hans Kammler, known as "Skoda Works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. Kammler, a high-ranking Nazi deeply committed to the ideology, oversaw the V2 rocket program and other "breakthrough technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. Many believe Flying Saucer-shaped craft were part of his mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

Noteworthy figures involved in these projects included:
*   **Rudolf Schriever**: A German technician who claimed to have worked on a disc-shaped craft in Prague that made its first test flight in February 1945, climbing to 40,000 feet in three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.
*   **Viktor Schauberger**: A naturalist whose ideas on "free energy" or "zero point energy" were connected to anti-gravitational effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>. He designed a flying saucer with an "impeller engine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a> and reportedly worked on secret projects for Kammler in Czechoslovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>.
*   **Richard Miethe**: Also had designs for a flying saucer, working in high voltage physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>.

Adding to the intrigue, Paul Mellon, a CIA founder, reportedly saw a German flying disc in a hangar in Czechoslovakia at the end of WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

### The "Glocka" (Bell) and its [[time_travel_and_ufo_connection | Time Travel and UFO Connection]]
A particularly wild rumor surrounding Skoda Works is "The Glocka" or "The Bell"—a bell-shaped device believed to create torsion fields and time dilation effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. While Cook credits Polish writer Igor Witkowski for popularizing this story, he visited the purported site in Poland, observing evidence of a secret installation with heavy cabling for electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>. Cook later concluded that it was likely one of several sites the SS used to investigate [[connection_between_ufos_and_nuclear_technology | nuclear technology]] beyond the known Heisenberg program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>. The device was supposedly codenamed "Kronos," the Greek god of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

## Post-War American Pursuit of Anti-Gravity

### The 1950s Gravity Research Boom
The 1950s saw a bizarrely in-vogue study of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>. Michael Gladych's article mentioned "G particles" (gravitons) and cited Stanley Deser and Richard Arnowitt at Princeton as involved in this research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>. There was even a Gravity Essay Contest involving top theoretical physicists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>. As mathematician Lewis Whitten observed, "anti-gravity was in the wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>, implying either ubiquitous public interest or a scattered, obfuscated secret effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>.

An Australian intelligence memo from 1971, cited by David Grusch, points to a deep, hidden American interest in anti-gravity during the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a>. The memo, from the head of Australia's joint intelligence organization's [[UFO sightings and nuclear connection | nuclear division]], Harry Turner, noted that their nuclear testing facilities had experienced bizarre [[UFO sightings and their connection to nuclear sites worldwide | UFO encounters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>. It listed top aerospace companies (Martin Corporation, Lear, Convair, Bell) and physicists, including Robert J. Oppenheimer, as deeply involved in anti-gravity research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>.

Agnew H. Bahnson Jr., an industrialist obsessed with anti-gravity, funded the Institute for Field Physics at UNC Chapel Hill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>. His 1957 Chapel Hill conference convened top physicists like John Wheeler, Richard Feynman, and Freeman Dyson, and was sponsored by Wright Airfield, a hub of [[History and impact of UFO sightings and materials | UFO rumors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. Lewis Whitten himself was studying anti-gravity for Wright Airfield at George Trimble's Research Institute for Advanced Study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>.

Intriguingly, Bahnson wrote a science fiction book, *The Stars Are Too High*, about rogue Nazi scientists brought to America after the war to build man-made flying saucers using anti-gravity. In the book, these saucers are used to stage a fake alien invasion to ease Cold War tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>.

### Thomas Townsend Brown and the B2 Bomber
Thomas Townsend Brown, a mid-century engineer, made discoveries in electrogravitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>. His work is rumored to have influenced the B2 stealth bomber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>. Electrostatic charging can reduce a vehicle's radar signature and drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:34:00">[31:34:00]</a>. Brown demonstrated his "fan precipitator" to Edward Teller in 1965, astonishing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27:00">[32:27:00]</a>. Brown's company, Guidance Technologies, funded by Northrop owner Floyd Odom, shut down mysteriously in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:23:00">[33:23:00]</a>. Three months later, Northrop published a paper on "electrogravitics and its implications for aviation," a term then only used to describe Brown's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.

When the B2 bomber was revealed, *Aviation Week* reported it used an "electrokinetic effect" and a "Byfield Brown effect" in its wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:08:00">[34:08:00]</a>. Furthermore, Brown's wife received payments from Odom for the rest of her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>. Aviation journalist Bill Gunston noted the B2's performance data didn't add up, suggesting a propulsion method beyond its engines, and cryptically referenced Brown's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13:00">[35:13:00]</a>. If Brown's work influenced the B2, it validates his more exotic anti-gravity experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>.

Brown was also supposedly involved in the "Philadelphia Experiment" in 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:39:00">[37:39:00]</a>, which, despite its mythological exaggerations of invisibility and [[time_travel_and_ufo_connection | teleportation]], likely involved creating a high-voltage envelope around a ship to scramble its magnetic signature and avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:15:00">[38:15:00]</a>. Brown's FBI file from 1943 stated he "knew more about radar than anyone in the Navy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>.

### Ning Li's Anti-Gravity Research
Ning Li, a Chinese-American physicist, became a focus of interest due to her research and subsequent disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:21:00">[40:21:00]</a>. In the 1990s, at the University of Alabama Huntsville, she developed a theory of gravity manipulation using rapidly rotating superconductors, claiming a weight loss effect of 0.5% to 2.1% in test masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>. This claim, if true, would unify electromagnetism and gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:59:00">[41:59:00]</a>.

After these groundbreaking results, Li left the university to start AC Gravity LLC with her physics chair, Larry Smalley, who was convinced by her findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>. The company immediately won a DOD contract, and Li received security clearance, disappearing from public view for 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>. Smalley was also on NASA patents for a barrel-shaped asymmetric capacitor, linking Li's work to Brown's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46:00">[42:46:00]</a>. Li's son noted her increased secretiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>. In 2008, she reportedly refused a CCP offer to continue her work in China, resulting in a travel ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>.

The potential dual-use nature of such technology, capable of transforming a thermonuclear bomb into a "child's firecracker," highlights the extreme secrecy and caution surrounding its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:21:00">[45:21:00]</a>.

## Skunk Works and Black Projects

### Ben Rich's Enigmatic Statements
Ben Rich, former director of Lockheed Martin's secretive Skunk Works, hinted at advanced technology. Towards the end of his life, he made strange comments at a UCLA speech, alluding to Skunk Works having the technology to "take ET home" and travel across star systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:17:00">[49:17:00]</a>. When asked how, he responded, "How does ESP work?" and stated, "All points in space and time are connected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:26:00">[49:26:00]</a>. Later, on his deathbed, he reportedly told John Andrews that "we already have the means to travel among the stars, but these Technologies are locked up in Black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit Humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>.

Rich spoke in parables, describing how stealth technology, once considered impossibly challenging, was almost "buried" to prevent its spread, much like the secrecy surrounding atomic bomb physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:32:00">[50:32:00]</a>.

### The Aurora Project
Cook and his colleague Bill Sweetman investigated "Aurora," a mythical Mach 5 hypersonic aircraft rumored to replace the SR-71 Blackbird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>. Evidence included:
*   Unattributable sonic booms detected by the US Geological Survey tracking towards Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:52:00">[58:52:00]</a>.
*   An oil rig engineer, Chris Gibson (a highly disciplined Royal Observer Corps spotter), sketching a dart-shaped black aircraft escorted by F-111s and being refueled over the North Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:56:00">[59:56:00]</a>.
*   A 1980s budget showing a $2 billion line item for Aurora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   British Ministry of Defense documents in the early 90s discussing hypersonic craft with novel propulsion from the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   An RAF pilot confirming encounters with Aurora over the North Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.

Bill Sweetman believed the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program, publicly funded by Reagan, was a cover program channeling advanced technologies like scramjets and new materials into Aurora, a classified program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. General George Mullner, head of US Air Force R&D, implied Aurora filled a "gap" in reconnaissance capabilities between the SR-71's retirement and the deployment of new digital satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>.

### The "Astra" Incident
Cook himself had a peculiar experience at the Skunk Works headquarters, being shown an internal organizational chart with an aircraft named "Astra" at the top, above publicly acknowledged designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>. His inquiry about it led to him being immediately ushered out. Later, a Skunk Works boss implied that the "Astra" incident was well-known internally but maintained that Astra "hasn't flown yet" but would "make an appearance sometime soon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. Cook's discovery that the visit was on April Fool's Day led him to suspect he was intentionally "fed breadcrumbs" to write about a potential classified aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.

## [[UFOs and Human Consciousness | Consciousness]] and Heretical Science
The aerospace industry has a longstanding interest in "mind over matter effects" or parapsychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. James McDonald, of McDonald Douglas, was interested in [[ufos_and_religious_connection | UFOs and religious connection]], instructing his company to study them to transpose knowledge into aerospace programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>. Agencies like the CIA also funded "heretical science" like remote viewing for 18 years, seeing potential advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:02:00">[55:02:00]</a>. This suggests that aerospace companies are willing to explore any field, no matter how unconventional, if it offers a possible advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:22:00">[54:22:00]</a>.

## Implications for the Future
The extensive secrecy surrounding advanced propulsion systems, potentially including man-made UFOs, suggests that if breakthroughs in anti-gravity have occurred, they have been militarized and turned into "special access programs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:00">[29:38:00]</a>. This could explain why the public perceives a lack of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

Some argue that if a modern arms race is underway to reverse-engineer UFOs, the balkanized and siloed American programs may be at a disadvantage compared to the nationalized and centralized efforts of Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. Furthermore, advancing "heterodox science projects" could accelerate progress, potentially enabling interstellar travel and even manipulating space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, given that gravity and time are tightly coupled in general relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

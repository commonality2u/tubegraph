[[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Uri Geller]] recounted a meeting he had with Dr. [[werner_von_braun_and_his_role_in_the_space_program | Werner Von Braun]], known as the "grandfather of the Space Program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Despite [[werner_von_braun_and_his_role_in_the_space_program | Von Braun]]'s past as a Nazi, [[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Geller]]'s curiosity, prompted by [[werner_von_braun_and_his_role_in_the_space_program | Von Braun]]'s reputation as a "rocket genius," led him to accept the invitation to meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Encounter with Unusual Metal

During their meeting, [[werner_von_braun_and_his_role_in_the_space_program | Werner Von Braun]] presented [[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Geller]] with a piece of metal, asking him to touch it and describe his sensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Geller]] immediately perceived that it "doesn't feel like it's from here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Following this initial experience, [[werner_von_braun_and_his_role_in_the_space_program | Von Braun]] led [[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Geller]] into his personal office, where he opened a safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Inside, [[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Geller]] observed another piece of metal, noting its unique color and lack of weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. When asked to touch this second piece, [[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Geller]] unequivocally stated, "this is not from here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Revelation of Extraterrestrial Origin

At this point, [[werner_von_braun_and_his_role_in_the_space_program | Werner Von Braun]] confirmed [[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Geller]]'s intuition, revealing that the metal was "a piece of a UFO that crashed on our planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This revelation was particularly impactful for [[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Geller]], who had been fascinated by films on [[werner_von_brauns_beliefs_in_extraterrestrial_life | extraterrestrial life]] since childhood, often sneaking into movie theaters in Tel Aviv to watch them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The confirmation coming directly from [[werner_von_braun_and_his_role_in_the_space_program | Von Braun]] left [[uri_gellers_experience_with_unusual_metals | Geller]] "mind blown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

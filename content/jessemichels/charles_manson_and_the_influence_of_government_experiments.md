The notorious cult leader [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Charles Manson]] and the horrific murders committed by his followers have been the subject of extensive investigation, but some theories suggest a deeper connection to [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | government mind control programs]] like [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. Journalist Tom O'Neill spent 20 years investigating the [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson Murders]], uncovering a plotline that involved [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA brainwashing]] and government mind control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

## [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] Program Overview

[[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] was a brainwashing program developed by the [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA]] from the late 1940s into the early 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>. It was originally created as a defensive program after U.S. intelligence learned that the Soviet Union, Chinese, and North Koreans had developed techniques to brainwash people into making false confessions using drugs and sensory deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. The United States wanted to learn how to defend against these tactics, particularly for captured Airmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. What began as a defensive program quickly evolved into an offensive one as its effectiveness became clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

The ultimate goal of [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] was to create a programmed assassin, individuals who could be hypnotized to kill without reason or recollection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The program also aimed to control groups of thousands of people using media and other technologies, and to implant information into service members' minds for courier purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. A primary focus was the control of memory: implanting false memories without a person's knowledge and taking away true memories, initially using sodium pentothal, then [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]], and other undisclosed drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:44">[03:34:44]</a>.

The program was exposed by a whistleblower in 1975, leading to sensational revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:33">[03:54:33]</a>. The [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA]] had to acknowledge its existence, which was not only illegal due to operating on U.S. soil but also horrific because it involved human experiments without knowledge or consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:27">[04:00:27]</a>. These experiments began in prisons and jails, then expanded to service people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. "Safe houses" were even set up in San Francisco and New York City where prostitutes administered [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] to "Johns" who were then observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

The program continued until around 1973-1974, at which point Richard Helms, running the [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA]], ordered all files destroyed due to anticipated discoveries during Watergate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. The program would have remained unknown had State Department official John Marx not found financial files in 1974, leading to Congressional investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. During these hearings (including the Church hearings), the [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA]] lied, claiming the program was ineffective and foolish, and Congress allowed them to get away with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. However, much of the research was indeed effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

### Key Researchers and Notable Subjects

*   **Jolly West (Louis J. West)**: A psychiatrist who reported to the [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA]] in 1955 that he had developed technology to implant false memories and remove true memories using drugs and hypnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. West was involved in [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] experiments on hippies at the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. He was the head of UCLA Psychiatry and started the first Neuroscience Center at the University of Oklahoma, where he began experiments on prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. His original report, detailing the successful implementation of memory control, was censored from the documents submitted to Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Jack Ruby**: Jolly West became the psychiatrist for Jack Ruby, who shot Lee Harvey Oswald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. After spending about an hour alone with Ruby in jail, West held a press conference announcing Ruby had suffered a psychotic break from which he would never recover, experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. From that day forward, Ruby could not string three coherent sentences together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. West's specialty included inducing insanity in a person without their knowledge, a fact not disclosed to the Warren Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>.
*   **Whitey Bulger**: The criminal Whitey Bulger discovered late in his life that he had volunteered for medical experiments in prison in the 1950s, which were later revealed to be [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] brainwashing experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **Ted Kaczynski (Unabomber)**: Ted Kaczynski voluntarily participated in an [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] experiment at Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Ewen Cameron**: Operated out of Canada, conducting torturous techniques on people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Andre Puharich**: Had the Round Table Institute in Maine and an outpost in Upstate New York where they experimented with "space kids" to communicate with "otherworldly beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Gene Roddenberry's *Star Trek* was allegedly channeled via Phyllis Schlafly through this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

## [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson]] and [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]]

The core question motivating O'Neill's investigation was how [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] managed to compel young women to commit horrific murders without remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. This led him to the [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.

### Coincidences and Connections

*   **Jolly West's Presence**: Jolly West, an alleged [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] participant, was working with [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] on hippies at the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. This is where [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] began his cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. O'Neill's research into West's papers revealed an alias used for Sidney Gottlieb, the head of the [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] program at the [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. West's experiments and [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]]'s arrival in San Francisco, followed by their migration to Los Angeles, align with the period [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] transformed into exactly what the [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA]] had been trying to create for 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.
*   **Manson's Transformation**: Before 1967, [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] was a petty criminal, not particularly charismatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. Within a year, he became a "sex god cult leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.
*   **Parole Officer Roger Smith**: [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]]'s parole officer, Roger Smith, was a criminology student at Berkeley and a drug researcher specializing in the effects of amphetamines and [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] on adolescents joining violent gangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.
*   **Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic**: David Smith, who ran the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic, was connected to "Operation Midnight Climax," a [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | CIA]] operation where individuals like [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] would be "dosed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.
*   **Prison Exposure**: [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] was in federal institutions from age 12 or 13, and [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] research was being conducted at those facilities, including in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>. These programs targeted "bad boys" prone to crime and violence who lacked family support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:13:00">[32:13:00]</a>.
*   **"Stranger in a Strange Land"**: [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]]'s life and ideology were modeled after Robert Heinlein's 1968 sci-fi novel *Stranger in a Strange Land*, which was popular among hippies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>. Despite being supposedly illiterate, [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]]'s life paralleled the book's narrative, including a race war, a leader born on Mars dispatched to Earth to start a new society, communal wives, and a protector character named Jubal (the nickname [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] gave his parole officer, Roger Smith) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. This raises questions about whether he was dosed with [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] and read the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.

> "I present in the book a case that I haven't proven it absolutely but I make a case that these two men are intersected and Manson was experimented with the girls were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>

### Government Tracking and Infiltration

Evidence suggests [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] was being tracked by authorities before the Tate murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36:00">[20:36:00]</a>. The Spahn Ranch, where the Manson Family lived, was raided and bugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>.

*   **Reev Witson**: A mysterious figure who worked for the government and infiltrated the Manson family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. Witson admitted near his death that his dying regret was not preventing the murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>. He claimed to have been at the Tate crime scene after the murders and left before the police arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. Physical evidence and sound evidence indicate someone was at the property the night of the murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>.

## The Tate-LaBianca Murders

On August 8, 1969, Sharon Tate, the eight-month pregnant wife of director Roman Polansky, along with her houseguests Voytek Frykowski, Abigail Folger, and Jay Sebring, were brutally murdered in a home invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. A 19-year-old visitor, Steven Parent, was also killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. The victims were stabbed more than 200 times, and blood writing was left on the wall, creating a horrific crime scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35:00">[24:35:00]</a>. The following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were also murdered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

Three months later, a group of hippies living communally at Spahn Ranch and then Death Valley were captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Early reports identified their leader as [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Charles Manson]], a 32-year-old ex-convict with 10 or 15 "wives" and kids raised communally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. The subsequent trial garnered unprecedented attention in Los Angeles until the O.J. Simpson trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

### Official Narrative (Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi)

The official narrative, established by prosecutor Vince Bugliosi, stated that [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] believed an impending race war, which he called "Helter Skelter" after The Beatles song, was taking too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. He ordered his followers to commit the murders to trigger this race war and shock the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. Signs were left at the crime scenes to implicate the Black Panthers, intending to turn the world against Black people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Manson's prophecies were believed to derive from Beatles lyrics and the Old Testament's Book of Revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. During the trial, [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] and his female co-defendants mimicked each other, notably carving Xs into their foreheads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

The widespread obsession with the case stemmed not just from the horrific nature of the murders or the celebrity victims, but from the unprecedented sight of young people killing for joy and laughing about it without remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

## [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA and Potential Involvement in the Manson Case]]

The theory connecting [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] to [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | government mind control]] suggests a motive beyond the official "Helter Skelter" narrative. This motive involves the [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA]]'s "Operation Chaos" and the FBI's "COINTELPRO" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>.

### Operation Chaos and COINTELPRO

These operations, beginning in 1967 in San Francisco, were designed to neutralize the left-wing and Black militant movements in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. By 1967, the Black Panthers were gaining power, and the anti-war movement was escalating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. FBI head J. Edgar Hoover believed the internal youth movement posed the biggest threat to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>.

Agents infiltrated groups to provoke them into committing crimes, leading to their being shot or killed by agents, or to provoke infighting among groups, especially Black Panthers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>. For example, two Black U.S. Slaves group members killed at UCLA in 1968 were later admitted by the FBI (via a whistleblower) to have been orchestrated by FBI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>.

### [[impact_of_mk_ultra_on_hippie_and_counterculture_movements | Impact of the Murders on Counterculture]]

The Tate house symbolized "liberal Hollywood," a party house where white celebrities were financially supporting groups like the Black Panthers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>. In November 1968, Hoover wrote a memo instructing the head of the L.A. field office to make white supporters of the Panthers fear they would be slaughtered during a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. Nine months later, five white people were slaughtered in a house embodying the left-wing Hollywood establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>.

The theory suggests that if the goal was to co-opt the counterculture, creating a "construct" like [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]]—a hippie-looking, counterculture revolutionary type—to commit savage acts would effectively marginalize the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>. The murders had a profound [[impact_of_mk_ultra_on_hippie_and_counterculture_movements | impact on the hippie and counterculture movements]]. Don DeLillo and others claimed August 8, 1969, was "the day the 60s ended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

Within a week of [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]]'s arrest, media portrayed his young, long-haired, "love bead" wearing female followers as savage murderers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a>. This terrified the public, causing them to fear hippies and stop picking up hitchhikers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. If Chaos and COINTELPRO aimed to make society fear the left-wing movement, the [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson Murders]] accomplished that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>.

### Other Alleged Connections

*   **The Grateful Dead**: The Grateful Dead were early distributors of free [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] at their concerts, with Owsley Stanley as the chemist. Some theories suggest Stanley was a [[cia_and_potential_involvement_in_the_manson_case | CIA]] agent and the band knew his true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a>.

Ultimately, evidence suggests the government had more knowledge about the murders, and that [[charles_manson_and_the_sharon_tate_murders | Manson]] himself might have been a "construct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.

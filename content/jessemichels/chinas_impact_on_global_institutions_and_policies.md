## Introduction to China's Global Ambition

The [[Chinese Communist Partys strategies and ambitions | Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]] views Xi Jinping as the figure who will restore China to its rightful place on the global stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The United States now faces an unprecedented external threat from China, which endangers the "fragile 250-year American experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. The FBI is reportedly opening a new China-related counterintelligence case approximately every 10 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Strategic Deception and Long-Term Planning

Since the Nixon administration, China has employed "tongue and cheek double speak" in its communications with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. When Premier Zhou Enlai told Henry Kissinger that America was the "ba," translated as "leader," the actual meaning in Chinese was "tyrant," signaling China's intent to displace the US as global hegemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

According to foreign policy strategist Michael Pillsbury, understanding the CCP's strategy requires familiarity with the Chinese Warring States period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Pillsbury's book, *The Hundred-Year Marathon*, states that Chinese strategy is rooted in lessons from this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. A 1991 Chinese government document, leaked and translated by Beijing as "bide your time, build your capabilities," actually alludes to overturning the old hegemon (the US) and exacting revenge once the rising power has the ability to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Economic Influence and Elite Capture

American policy, as articulated in documents signed by various presidents, consciously aimed to build China into a major power, operating under the assumption that the US would still remain easily number one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>. This approach was heavily influenced by Thomas Friedman's 2005 book, *The World is Flat*, which posited that economic liberalization would inevitably lead to political liberalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>. This belief formed the bedrock of both neoliberalism and neoconservatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. However, this policy has not been changed, despite its failure to induce political openness in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

American elites, including firms like Goldman Sachs, actively cultivated relationships in China, believing it would lead to mutual enrichment and China's liberalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. Instead, China's leaders observed America's "decadence" and exploited it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:57">[02:37:57]</a>. For example, China invested $1 billion in BlackRock, a major proponent of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing, which Peter Thiel equates with the CCP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

The CCP employs a strategy called the "United Front," a "massive parasite" that infiltrates host countries, laying eggs that "hatch in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This involves "elite capture" of influential individuals, businesses, and foundations with an interest in doing business with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:43">[02:21:43]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Hunter Biden**: Received $10 million annually for "introductions" and an $80,000 diamond from CFC China Energy Company Limited founder Ye Jianming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Neil Bush**: Admitted in his divorce deposition to receiving women sent to his room in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Elaine Chao**: As Secretary of Transportation, she held 21 meetings with Chinese state media and zero with American media in her first year, often seated next to her father, founder of Foremost Group, a shipping company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. She also compelled the State Department to include family members in meetings with Chinese officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Wendy Deng Murdoch**: Lobbied for a Chinese Garden at the National Arboretum in Washington, funded by the Chinese government, which included a 70-foot White Tower the FBI believed could be used for spying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. A 2013 blog claimed she worked for the People's Liberation Army's propaganda division and was recruited as far back as 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

China also steals American intellectual property through programs like the "Thousand Talents Program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. Charles Lieber, former chair of Harvard's Chemistry Department, was convicted for his involvement, having received a $50,000 monthly stipend and other benefits from the Wuhan Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## Infiltration of International Institutions

China has systematically worked to infiltrate international institutions, pushing its civil servants or those of its clients and partners into top positions at organizations that set global standards for air travel, telecommunications, and agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the extent to which China has compromised the World Health Organization (WHO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. A Hong Kong news outlet's attempt to ask a WHO official about admitting Taiwan was met with a significant delay and avoidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

## Weaponization of Information and Pandemics

China has used COVID-19 to weaken the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. It deliberately suppressed news about the virus, even as it circulated in Wuhan, and locked down domestic travel before restricting international travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. The virus appeared near the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which possessed the world's largest collection of bat coronaviruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

This reflects a mindset rooted in dialectical materialism, where conflict and mass human suffering are seen as "inevitable costs of progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. COVID-19 confirmed for China that "asymmetric bio cyber and information warfare" is possible against the US, especially with complicit American bureaucrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

## Challenges to US Decoupling

Despite awareness of China's strategies, "decoupling" American and Chinese economies is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. US trade with China was over $600 billion in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. China controls approximately 60% of the world's rare earth minerals and processes nearly 90% of them, giving it a near monopoly on critical resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. Michael Pillsbury considers decoupling a "fantasy" and a "rhetorical device" because little significant legislation has been passed to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

China is described as richer, more powerful, and better organized than the Soviet Union ever was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. The CCP is waging the "world's biggest influence building campaign" and has the capacity to launch cyberattacks that can disrupt critical infrastructure in major American cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:00">[17:57:57]</a>. As of April 2024, FBI Director Christopher Wray announced that Chinese government-linked hackers had successfully gained access to US telecommunications, energy, water, and other critical sectors, waiting for the "right moment to deal a devastating blow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.

While the Middle East escalates, the Chinese Politburo is using it as a "distraction to sharpen its sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>. Xi Jinping has consolidated power, removing liberal leaders and pivoting towards hardline nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>. China has interned millions of Uyghurs in "re-education camps" and brutally suppressed pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. It is also actively planning an invasion of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that American self-sufficiency is crucial, requiring reshoring jobs in vital industries like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>. The US must also return to a capitalism that prioritizes production over consumption and invest in frontier science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>.

In many ways, US challenges mirror China's methods: mass surveillance in big tech, cancel culture akin to social credit scoring, and an schooling system that resembles Chinese Confucian bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>. The speaker suggests that if [[The potential implications of UFOs on nuclear weapons and global security | David Grusch]] is correct about a Cold War to reverse engineer non-human technology, America might need to look to "more transcendent forces" for a benevolent partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.

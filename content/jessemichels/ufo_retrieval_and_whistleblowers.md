For thousands of years, people have reported seeing unidentified objects in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. More recently, for the last 80 years, speculation has grown regarding the involvement of the American and other governments with UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

## Firsthand Witness Testimony

Jake, a former Air Force Special Operations combat control candidate who became a "red team" expert, claims to be a firsthand witness to [[UFO crash retrieval | UFO crash retrievals]] and interactions with non-human technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>. He received a specialized "Guaranteed Training Education Program" (GP) contract in 1994, which fast-tracked him through Special Operations training with the Department of the Air Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. The Air Force, established in 1947 shortly after the Roswell incident and alongside the CIA and Department of Defense, has historically operated across what Jake calls the "blue black line"â€”the open-source, public world (blue) and highly cleared, sensitive operations (black) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

Jake clarifies that his role quickly diverged from traditional combat control, serving as a "cover" for deeper involvement in undisclosed programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. He specialized in security and transportation, particularly in helicopter operations, and held contracts with the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of the Interior, and State Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. This legitimate work served as a cover for his primary purpose: being available for "missions for the program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:07">[03:41:07]</a>.

### The "Egg" Retrieval

Jake describes his first direct encounter with a non-human craft, which he calls "the egg" due to its shape and pearly white color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:17">[03:46:17]</a>. This incident occurred at night in the California desert, a common testing ground for the DOD and private aerospace partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>.

He, as a helicopter pilot, was called in to transport the egg via an external load, suspended by a 150 to 200-foot line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:48">[03:57:48]</a>. The craft was approximately 20 feet long and weighed less than 5,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:23">[04:00:23]</a>. It was smooth, seamless, and lacked any visible symbology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:36">[04:00:36]</a>. Ground crew members, whose experiences were not shared with Jake, secured it with nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:40">[04:02:40]</a>.

Jake recounts that this encounter was unexpected for everyone involved, including his leadership, leading to immediate alterations in communication and security protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:55">[04:03:55]</a>. He identifies three reasons for believing the craft was non-human:
1.  **Unforeseen arrival**: Its appearance was not anticipated by his team, who were experts in advanced US government and private industry technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>.
2.  **Official Confirmation**: Ranking members of the UAP task force later confirmed to him that it was non-human anomalous intelligence (NHI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:57">[04:07:57]</a>.
3.  **Repeatability**: Since leaving the program, Jake and his team (Skywatcher Technologies) have been able to intentionally summon the "egg" and track it in broad daylight, moving at speeds up to 10,000 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:15">[04:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:52">[04:08:52]</a>. This repeatable observation, with supporting sensor data, has been provided to the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:53">[04:09:53]</a>.

### The "Eight-Gon" Retrieval and Consciousness Interface

Another retrieval involved a disc-shaped craft with eight distinct sections, referred to as the "eight-gon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:33">[04:59:33]</a>. This object was dark gray or black, approximately 25-30 feet in size, and located in the California desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:40">[05:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:08">[05:02:08]</a>. Prior to retrieval, Jake received a Hazmat disclosure for "biologics" but "negative souls on board," implying non-human biological material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:22">[05:02:22]</a>.

During this retrieval, Jake experienced a profound emotional connection with the craft, describing it as a beautiful, sad, feminine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:55">[05:03:55]</a>. This emotional overload, which nearly compromised his ability to pilot the helicopter, was unlike any stress he had encountered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:19">[05:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. He speculates this connection was either from a conscious entity within the craft or a psionics team working that night, whose consciousness might have become trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:01">[05:06:01]</a>.

## Connection to Whistleblowers and Secrecy

Jake's experiences and revelations are intertwined with the broader issue of [[UFO Disclosure and Coverups | UFO disclosure and coverups]]. He notes that many [[whistleblower_accounts_of_ufo_incidents | whistleblowers have already come forward]] over the years, though their testimonies often get dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:06">[03:11:06]</a>. He explicitly states that people have died under suspicious circumstances after speaking out about these activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>.

### Michael Herrera's Testimony

A pivotal moment for Jake was hearing Michael Herrera's testimony at a 2023 [[whistleblower_accounts_of_ufo_incidents | whistleblower conference]] in Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>. Herrera, a Marine, described seeing an "eight-gon" shaped craft in Indonesia in 2009, which was then secured by an "elite paramilitary unit" with advanced bio-scanners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. This unit, described as possibly from the Department of Energy, threatened Herrera's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.

Jake confirms key aspects of Herrera's story, including the existence of such paramilitary units, the accurate description of the "eight-gon" craft (though Herrera's claimed size of 300 feet was larger than Jake's experience), and the presence of specialized containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. Jake reveals that his team was the one who "back-channeled" the information to Herrera, confirming that the paramilitary unit was transferring "psionic assets" for the program, which Herrera interpreted as human trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>. Jake clarifies that while these individuals are "prospect[ed]" from third-world countries and transported, they often come willingly due to economic imbalance and the opportunity to use their unique talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>.

Jake was initially at the conference to "red team" potential [[whistleblower_accounts_of_ufo_incidents | whistleblowers]] and report them to the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>. However, after hearing Herrera, he realized the truth in the claims and decided to "black team the black team," actively working against the opaque systems of secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Government Secrecy and Misinformation

Jake emphasizes the chaotic and disorganized nature of the [[covert_government_programs_and_ufo_recovery | covert government programs]] dealing with UAPs, describing it as a "gangly octopus" rather than a monolithic, well-organized entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:12">[01:50:12]</a>. He believes private aerospace contractors hold much of the power, and the US government lost control a long time ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:59">[01:30:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>. This decentralization allows for plausible deniability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>.

He recounts an incident where his team was tasked with recovering "tough books" containing sensitive information, believed to be evidence of "criminal activity" and illegal data capture related to [[ufo_crash_retrieval | crash retrieval]] programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:02">[01:41:02]</a>. This mission escalated to shots being fired, prompting Jake to fully commit to exposing the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:52">[01:39:52]</a>. He sought help from Congress, only to find that even high-ranking officials were "ignorant and neutered" on the subject, or "corrupt and arrogant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15">[01:51:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:27">[01:51:27]</a>. Some even sought his personal protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56">[01:47:56]</a>.

### The DOD Prepublication Security Review (DOSER) Process

Jake strategically used the DOSER process, which reviews all public statements by former DOD personnel, to expose information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:48">[02:01:48]</a>. His team submitted a "historical fiction" manuscript, or "faction," containing four types of information:
1.  **Known classified information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a>.
2.  **Highly compartmentalized classified information** only known by operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:10">[02:06:10]</a>.
3.  **Open-source classified information** (leaked but technically classified) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a>.
4.  **Complete fictional speculation** to "fish" for redactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:29">[02:07:29]</a>.

The seven pages of redactions they received validated claims across all four categories, revealing areas of concern within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:03">[02:08:03]</a>. This process highlighted that by redacting information, the DOD indirectly validates its sensitivity, or by allowing it, unintentionally "seals it with the stamp of fictional" writing, thereby concealing truth in plain sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:29">[02:08:29]</a>.

## Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) and its Implications

Jake explains that the focus should shift from just [[UFO reverse engineering and crash retrievals | reverse engineering]] to understanding the broader implications of NHI, which may not be "extra" at all but "something that's part of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:13">[01:52:13]</a>.

### Psionics and Summoning

Jake explains that [[UFOs and Government Disclosure | UFOs]] can be intentionally summoned. There are two types:
1.  **Machine-based summoning systems**: Energy systems and signals that attract UAP activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.
2.  **Man-based summoning systems**: Individuals, or "psionic assets," trained in remote viewing and psychic abilities, who can access a "consciousness field" to influence the phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.

These individuals are trained to lower their intellect, heighten intuition, and reintroduce intellect as an observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. This can be achieved through "stress inoculation" (triggering fight-or-flight responses) and disassociation (chemically or through meditation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. Children are naturally more intuitive, and their instincts are often satisfied, making them suitable for such roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>. He expresses concern about the unethical treatment of children in the program, including those used in these roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.

Modern methods involve non-intrusive ultrasound systems to target the brain and induce this state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. Experiments with random number generators show that individuals in this state can statistically influence the outcome, demonstrating "mind over matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. This psionic data is correlated with other sensor data, providing multi-sensory corroboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.

### The New Jersey Drone Incident

Jake and his team were assigned to support the DOD and FBI task force during the New Jersey drone incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:35">[02:19:35]</a>. They observed orange orbs, consistent with large drones, over Picatinny Arsenal, some appearing to disappear and reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:16">[02:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>. These objects, which were operating at night, above 400 feet, and with lights off, were in violation of FAA regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:57">[02:23:57]</a>.

Jake believes some of these incidents involve genuine non-human intelligence (NHI) due to their transition in and out of the atmosphere and data from their observation operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:50">[02:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:59">[02:30:59]</a>. He also notes the historical pattern of UAPs appearing around sensitive military sites, such as nuclear power plants and weapons installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:35">[02:36:35]</a>.

### Broader Implications and Future Disclosure

Jake discusses the profound implications of [[ufos_and_government_disclosure | UFO disclosure]], which he sees as more than just "flying equipment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. It's about recognizing "something else out there that's maybe not extra at all, it's something that's part of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. He believes that [[UFO disclosure and secrecy | UFO disclosure and secrecy]] has led to a lack of trust in institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:31">[02:33:31]</a>.

He emphasizes that the NHI phenomenon is both benevolent and malevolent, much like humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:02">[02:43:02]</a>. His personal experiences have been overwhelmingly positive, even extending to his family, who have witnessed a "blue angel" UAP hover over their house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:18">[02:48:18]</a>.

Jake is now part of Skywatcher Technologies, a private organization formed by individuals with official government experience, aiming to openly explore UAP phenomena and assist the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:42">[02:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>. Their goal is to demonstrate UAP phenomena publicly, potentially with a ground landing, by the first half of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:42">[02:58:42]</a>. He encourages individuals to seek answers for themselves, both through external research and internal exploration, suggesting that opening one's heart to "good energy" can lead to personal experiences with the phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:20">[02:47:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:01">[02:48:01]</a>.

He concludes by stating that [[UFOs and Government Disclosure | government is in possession of UAPs]], a claim corroborated by [[ufos_and_government_disclosure | David Grusch]], though the details of "biologics" (non-conscious tissue) and the craft's own consciousness are still being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:02">[02:55:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.

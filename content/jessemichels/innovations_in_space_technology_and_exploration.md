Lux Capital, co-founded and managed by Josh Wolfe, has built a portfolio that reflects a deep "love of sci-fi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This passion extends to [[technological_revolutions_and_scientific_exploration_of_ufos | investing in hard science and technology]], particularly within the aerospace and defense sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Key Investments and Companies

Lux Capital's portfolio includes notable companies driving [[private_sector_and_government_approaches_to_exploring_advanced_propulsion_and_aerospace_technology | innovations in space]]:
*   **VardaSpace** is a Lux portfolio company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> that focuses on creating "space factories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Relativity Space** initially focused on small satellite launchers, and may now be positioned to compete with SpaceX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Anduril** is involved in software and drones, contributing to advancements in aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## The Space Revolution

The current revolution in space is likened to the 19th-century expansion of railroads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Just as new materials were developed to lay steel tracks, today there are large propulsive rockets taking things vertically into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. A key innovation has been the decreasing cost of space access and the development of reusable rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This [[the_impact_of_reduced_launch_costs_on_space_ventures | reduction in launch costs]] is accelerating the development of the space industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Competing Visions for Space

There are two major, yet compatible, visions for space evolution:
*   **Elon Musk's vision** is somewhat escapist, focused on getting humanity to Mars and off Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Jeff Bezos's vision**, which Josh Wolfe is more partial to, involves moving "dull, dirty, dangerous stuff" off Earth and bringing it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. This is akin to "Amazon Prime but made in space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

## Geopolitical and Economic Aspects of Space

The geopolitical landscape is seeing the formation and reformation of "leagues in space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. For example, Russia declined a US offer to team on a lunar base, opting instead to collaborate with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

There is a global "race for prestige" in science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This race is exemplified by activities like Russia launching the first movie filmed in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This competition is expected to drive massive demand for cutting-edge microscopes and productivity-enabling software in science, leading to Nobel Prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Universities, government labs, and startups will fuel this demand for equipment and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

Space will also see the emergence of private space stations, serving as "local storage and delivery hubs" analogous to those seen in the real estate boom with AWS and Blackstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This signifies a new frontier and a "wild wild west" for commerce and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

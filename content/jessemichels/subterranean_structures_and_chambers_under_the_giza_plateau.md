The Giza Plateau, home to the iconic [[the_mysteries_of_the_great_pyramid_of_giza | pyramids]], is theorized to conceal an extensive network of subterranean rooms and cavities beneath its surface, including under the Sphinx itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This hidden world may hold secrets about [[theories_on_lost_civilizations_and_ancient_advanced_technology | lost civilizations]] and advanced ancient knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Evidence of Subterranean Networks
Ground-penetrating radar and sonar readings have revealed massive voids underneath the Sphinx and the [[the_mysteries_of_the_great_pyramid_of_giza | Great Pyramids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. These voids are not natural caves but appear to be cut with tools, containing unnatural objects like blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Robert Schoch was part of a team that spearheaded these sonar readings in the 1990s, which indicated a vast interconnected subterranean network beneath the entire Giza area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### The Sphinx as a Guardian
The Sphinx is believed to be a guardian, protecting an entire subterranean area beneath it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. It is thought to guard entrances to ancient libraries and underground areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. There are believed to be four known entrances under the Sphinx: one under the left paw, one on top of its head (which is capped off), and two others on its sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The Sphinx itself is carved out of bedrock, not assembled from separate stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The original form of the Sphinx is believed to have been a lion, aligning with the Leo constellation around 10,500 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The current [[pharaohs_and_elongated_heads | pharaonic headdress]] and smaller head are theorized to be a later "retrofit" by subsequent civilizations, such as the dynastic Egyptians, who adopted and claimed the older [[ancient_structures_and_their_potential_connections_to_extraterrestrial_technology | sites]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Concealment and Blockage
After the initial sonar readings in the 1990s went viral, Egyptian authorities reportedly boarded up the front of the Sphinx's paw entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. They also drilled in areas where no voids were present to mislead the public into believing nothing was there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This deliberate action suggests a desire to silence or hide information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Efforts are underway to gather funding and academic interest to reignite [[mysteries_and_discoveries_of_ancient_egypt | underground exploration]] at Giza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Hypothesized Contents and Purpose
The subterranean chambers are hypothesized to contain an ancient library, possibly the "Halls of Menti," as told by figures like Edgar Cayce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. If such a library exists, its records would need to be inscribed on durable materials like stone or clay tablets, as paper would not survive 10,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The use of specific stones like pink granite, which is high in silica quartz (the same substance used in watches), suggests that [[theories_on_lost_civilizations_and_ancient_advanced_technology | ancient civilizations]] might have incorporated technology into stone to record information in ways not yet understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. These [[ancient_structures_and_their_potential_connections_to_extraterrestrial_technology | structures]] were also aligned with celestial bodies, such as the King and Queen's chambers in the [[the_mysteries_of_the_great_pyramid_of_giza | Great Pyramid of Giza]] aligning with Orion and Sirius around 10,500 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This alignment reflects a sophisticated understanding of cosmology and the "great year" (a 26,000-year cycle of the precession of the equinoxes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

The purpose of these [[ancient_structures_and_their_potential_connections_to_extraterrestrial_technology | structures]] like the [[the_mysteries_of_the_great_pyramid_of_giza | Great Pyramid of Giza]] may have been to balance the Earth's energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. This concept, known as geodesy, involves creating structures in specific positions to match cardinal points, ratios of Earth, Sun, and Moon, and star constellations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. It's believed that such alignments could create a synergy, possibly acting as a portal between realms or facilitating higher states of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:49">[02:49:49]</a>. Evidence of massive energy surges or explosions found in granite boxes in places like the Serapeum at Saqqara suggest these structures were involved in balancing energy, possibly in response to catastrophic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.

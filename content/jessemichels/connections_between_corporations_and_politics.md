Danny Sheehan, an attorney involved in numerous [[20th_century_american_conspiracies | 20th century American conspiracies]], offers extensive insights into the deep and often clandestine [[the_influence_of_legacy_and_transnational_organizations | connections between corporations and political power]] in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His experiences as a public investigator and "people's advocate" in cases like Watergate, Karen Silkwood, and representing UFO whistleblowers have granted him a unique perspective on these intertwined relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Historical Foundations

Sheehan asserts that the [[the_influence_of_legacy_and_transnational_organizations | Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]] itself was the "brainchild" of individuals associated with powerful "Gilded Age families" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. He specifically mentions **Brown Brothers Harriman**, a collective investment company comprising some of the wealthiest "robber barons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:42">[01:50:42]</a>. These families would convene to direct their investments and influence policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57">[01:50:57]</a>.

### Post-WWI Influence on Germany

After World War I, these same interests, through figures like John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles, leveraged the Treaty of Versailles. Robert Lansing, the Secretary of State under President Wilson and the Dulles brothers' grandfather, oversaw the treaty negotiations and brought his nephews into the drafting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a>. The Dulles brothers drafted the war reparations provisions, which led to Germany owing substantial debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:45">[01:51:45]</a>.

Allen Dulles, then legal counsel for Brown Brothers Harriman, became the lawyer for Germany in a negotiation that led to Brown Brothers Harriman extending loans to the German government to cover these reparations, taking stock in German military corporations as security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:42">[01:52:42]</a>.

### Financing Nazism

According to Sheehan, this network continued its influence through **George Herbert Walker**, who left Brown Brothers Harriman in 1924 to establish the **Union Banking Corporation of New York** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:09">[01:53:09]</a>. This bank was fully capitalized by Brown Brothers Harriman investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:22">[01:53:22]</a>. The Union Banking Corporation's foreign subsidiary in the Netherlands, the **Bank of Shipping and Commerce**, run by Fritz Thyssen, financed the construction of the Third Reich's international headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:28">[01:53:28]</a>.

This financial support aimed to propel Adolf Hitler into power as a "bulwark against Bolshevism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:37">[01:53:37]</a>. The underlying economic theory was to establish a fascist government that would place "all the instrumentalities of the government at the disposal of the interests of the private corporations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. Prominent American industrialists, such as Henry Ford, supported this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:13">[01:54:13]</a>. The idea was that corporations would prosper, hire more people, and stimulate the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:03">[01:54:03]</a>. This system allowed for policies like deploying military forces to Nicaragua to overthrow democratically elected governments on behalf of corporate interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Corporate Control Over Government

Sheehan argues that these "Gilded Age" families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>, initially seeing their investment in Hitler as advantageous, lost control as Hitler became excessively aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:37">[01:56:37]</a>. The United States never formally declared war on Germany; instead, Germany declared war on the U.S. after Pearl Harbor, indicating a powerful domestic lobby against war with Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>.

Sheehan also suggests that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had foreknowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack and intentionally lured the Japanese, removing U.S. aircraft carriers from the harbor just before the attack, to rally American public support for entering the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:41">[01:57:41]</a>.

## Corporate Influence in Watergate

Sheehan's involvement in the Watergate case revealed further corporate-political connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:49">[01:41:49]</a>. The Watergate break-in was directly linked to the **S Force**, an assassination team initially created by Richard Nixon in 1960 to target Cuban leaders like Fidel Castro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. Nixon had contacted Howard Hughes, a secret consultant to the National Security Council and a key figure in defense projects, to set up this team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. Hughes, in turn, outsourced the task to mob figures like Johnny Roselli and Sam Giancana, who then involved Santos Trafficante Jr., a major figure in heroin trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>. The CIA's chief of security, Sheffield Edwards, greenlighted the assassination team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:28">[01:42:28]</a>.

The money funding this "S Force" and other covert operations came from the skimmed profits of mob casinos, funneled through Miami National Bank and into a Mexico City bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:08">[02:21:08]</a>.

The Watergate burglars, including E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis, were "S Force" veterans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:24">[02:19:24]</a>. The break-in targeted Democratic National Committee (DNC) head Lawrence O'Brien, who was also a major lobbyist for Howard Hughes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:08">[02:32:08]</a>. Nixon was terrified that if the FBI dug too deeply into the money trail from the Watergate burglars, it would expose his role in creating the assassination team that ultimately killed JFK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:08">[02:21:08]</a>.

:::info The "Smoking Gun"
Nixon's famous "Smoking Gun" conversation with H.R. Haldeman reveals his direct order to the CIA to stop the FBI's investigation into the Mexico City bank account to prevent exposure of the Cuban (S Force) operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:22">[02:20:22]</a>.

Sheehan also notes that James McCord, the CIA wiretapping specialist involved in Watergate, blew the whistle because he believed he was being "sold out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:37">[02:29:37]</a>. McCord was part of a group that believed they were thwarting "anti-Vietnam demonstrations" that the DNC was coordinating, believing their actions served national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:53">[02:29:53]</a>. Mark Felt ("Deep Throat"), the FBI deputy director, leaked information to the press out of personal revenge for being passed over for the FBI directorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:20">[02:31:20]</a>.

## Modern Day Corporate-Political Interactions

### UFO Disclosure and Aerospace Companies

Sheehan highlights the complex relationship between government, [[private_sector_and_government_approaches_to_exploring_advanced_propulsion_and_aerospace_technology | private aerospace companies]], and UFO disclosure. He explains that recent disclosures, including those by David Grusch, Lou Elizondo, and Chris Mellon, were not rogue acts but rather authorized by the U.S. Defense Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Sheehan argues that the push for "controlled disclosure" of UFO information through legislation (like the Schumer Amendment) is deeply influenced by corporate interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. Aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin, view UFO technology as "unfunded opportunities" for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. They aim to gain "patent rights" to alien technology, ensuring that the U.S. government would have to license its use for future advanced propulsion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>.

The removal of the "eminent domain" provision from the Schumer Amendment, which would have allowed the government to seize UFO craft from private possession, is attributed to the influence of figures like Mike Turner (House Intelligence Committee Chair) whose top donors are major aerospace companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### The Role of the [[global_conspiracy_and_deep_state | National Security State]]

Sheehan contends that the establishment of the [[global_conspiracy_and_deep_state | National Security State]] at the end of World War II, with the creation of the CIA, inherently involves intentional deception of the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:03">[02:55:03]</a>. This state aims for "greedy avaristic world domination" and projects its own shadows onto perceived adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:17">[02:55:17]</a>. A key tactic is to "target the epistemological sources of authority and penetrate them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:43">[02:55:43]</a>.

Sheehan's unique position, refusing a security clearance to maintain his ability to speak freely, allows him to access and analyze information that many others cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. He emphasizes the critical need for individuals to "figure things out for themselves" rather than relying solely on established authority figures or media, which can be manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>.

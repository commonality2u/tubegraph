The idea that life may be uncommon and that faster-than-light travel is impossible lacks evidence; instead, the available evidence suggests the opposite regarding the prevalence of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This evidence points towards life either evolving very quickly or a scenario consistent with [[panspermia_theory | panspermia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Supporting Evidence

Several observations support the notion of life's rapid emergence or its potential for interplanetary transfer:

*   **Early [[evolution_of_life_on_Earth | Evolution of Life on Earth]]**
    *   Fossilized blue-green algae found in stromatolites date back 3.5 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
    *   Recent scholarship suggests that [[evolution_of_life_on_Earth | life]] may have evolved even earlier, approximately 4.1 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
    *   Considering that Earth is 5 billion years old and its crust had not even cooled 4.1 billion years ago, this indicates that [[evolution_of_life_on_Earth | life]] evolved on Earth at the [[possibility_of_life_at_early_stages_of_earths_history | earliest possible time]], sooner than would be reasonably suspected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Viable [[microbial_life_in_outer_space | Microbial Life in Outer Space]]**
    *   Microbes have been identified that can survive in outer space, proving their viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
    *   Recently, microbes that had been in stasis within two-billion-year-old terrestrial rock were successfully revived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

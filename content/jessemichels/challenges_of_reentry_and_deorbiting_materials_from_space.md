Returning objects from space to Earth presents significant challenges, historically overshadowed by the "specter of catastrophe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The process of deorbiting and reentry is inherently risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Historical Context

The idea of [[manufacturing_in_microgravity_environments | microgravity manufacturing]] is not new; astronauts on Skylab and the International Space Station (ISS) have performed such missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, bringing the manufactured materials back to Earth has always been a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Watching old Apollo movies highlights reentry as the "scariest part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> due to intense heat, plasma, and communication blackouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Varda Space's Approach

Varda Space, founded by Delian Asparouhov and Will Bruey, aims to overcome these challenges to enable [[manufacturing_in_microgravity_environments | commercial manufacturing in space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Their business model relies on safely returning products to Earth.

### Reentry Expertise
Co-founder Will Bruey's background, particularly his work on SpaceX's Dragon capsule, was crucial because of his experience with deorbiting and reentering the Earth's atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This expertise is vital for Varda, as it addresses a key fear that has hindered past efforts in space manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Will likens the Dragon capsule's crew and cargo capabilities to a "gold-plated limousine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, while Varda's re-entry will be more like an "Amazon delivery van" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, focusing on package delivery rather than human comfort or safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Varda's Reentry Process
For their initial demonstration mission, Varda plans to launch a spacecraft with a manufacturing module and a reentry capsule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. After manufacturing, the product will de-orbit, with the manufacturing module burning up in the atmosphere, and only the capsule containing the products surviving reentry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Specific Technical Risks
While small-scale reentry capsules have been used before, Varda's technical push involves coming in from a very low orbit with less delta-v (change in velocity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This is considered a "newest thing" but less difficult than previous crewed and cargo reentries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The first mission aims to demonstrate the entire "assembly line" concept of operations, proving their ability to go to space, operate there, and successfully return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

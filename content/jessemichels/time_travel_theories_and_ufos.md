The concept of [[Time travel and UFO connection | time travel]] and its potential link to [[the concept of UFOs as interdimensional phenomena | Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP)]] (UFOs) is explored, suggesting that these phenomena might involve manipulation of space-time or even interactions with beings from a different temporal dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

## UFO Propulsion and Space-Time Manipulation
The properties of some UAPs suggest an advanced understanding of physics, particularly in the manipulation of space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:15">[03:50:15]</a>. Anomalous observations, such as "burns" on witnesses, might be due to light being "blue-shifted into the ultraviolet" as space is lensed around the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:56">[03:50:56]</a>. This suggests that these objects are not merely moving through space, but rather manipulating it, potentially by riding a "tsunami wave" across space-time, akin to an Alcubierre warp drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:53">[03:55:53]</a>. The rapid, "punctuated" movements observed could be explained by a "folding" or "accordion" like manipulation of space-time, allowing them to traverse vast distances non-linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:08">[04:01:08]</a>.

## Theories of UAP Origin and Time
Beyond [[Speculations on extraterrestrial life and UFOs | extraterrestrial life]], some theories propose that UAPs and their occupants could be related to [[Time travel and UFO connection | time travel]]:

### Interdimensional Phenomena
The idea of "quasi projection" suggests that UAPs could be higher-dimensional objects "casting shadow" into our three-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[01:21:48]</a>. This concept could explain why the "inside is bigger than the outside" of some reported crafts, similar to a 2D entity perceiving only a sliver of a 3D object as it passes through its plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>. A woman in San Jose described entering a flying saucer that felt like a "movie house" or "amphitheater" inside, which was larger than her physical house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>.

### Humans from the Future Hypothesis
One prominent theory, championed by biological anthropologist Mike Masters and supported by [[Historical figures and UFO programs | Jacques Vallee]], is that [[speculations_on_extraterrestrial_life_and_ufos | aliens]] are actually humans from the future who have mastered [[Time travel and UFO connection | time travel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.
*   **Evolutionary Convergence**: This hypothesis suggests that their bipedal, hominid-like appearance (as described in events like the [[Historical accounts of UFOs | Ariel School incident]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>) is not an evolutionary convergence but rather a result of future human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
*   **Neoteny**: Their "childlike" appearance aligns with the evolutionary concept of neoteny, where distant offspring resemble current juvenile forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.
*   **Future Human Characteristics**: If humans continue to evolve with abundant resources, bodies might become "vestigial," while brains and intuitive powers become more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. Traits like telepathy and changes in eye morphology (e.g., "slits" from increased screen time) could be adaptations of future humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.
*   **Non-Interventionism**: The "prime directive" observed in many abduction reports, where aliens are "weirdly noninterventionist" and limit their actions, makes sense in a time travel context to avoid paradoxes like the grandfather paradox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. Abductees sometimes report being "sanitized" or chemically rinsed, which could be a measure to prevent altering past timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.
*   **Lost Time**: Reports of "lost time" during abductions could be explained by these events occurring in a different "temporal dimension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.

## The Nature of Time and Consciousness
The discussion touches upon the fundamental nature of time, noting that it is not a constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>. General Relativity demonstrates that clocks speed up or slow down based on proximity to gravitational sources, a fact proven with cesium clocks on airplanes in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>. This suggests that our "felt sense" of constant linear time might be a limitation of "ordinary consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. The possibility that UAP sightings occur when individuals are in "heightened states of consciousness" further intertwines [[Role of UFOs in the study of time and consciousness | UFOs with human perception and awareness of time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

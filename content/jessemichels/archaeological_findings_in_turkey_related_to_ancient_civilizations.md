Recent archaeological findings in Eastern Turkey are prompting a re-evaluation of human history, suggesting the existence of a highly advanced [[lost_civilizations_and_shared_global_traditions | proto-civilization]] that predates conventionally accepted timelines and influenced cultures worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. These discoveries provide strong evidence supporting [[graham_hancocks_theories_on_ancient_civilizations | Graham Hancock's theories]] of a "species with amnesia" and shared global traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

## Unearthing Ancient Sites in the Lake Van Region

Several enigmatic sites have been discovered around Lake Van in Eastern Turkey, including Ayanis, Kef Kesi, Shavu Tepe, Coru, and Asver Ate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. These sites are notable for their extremely sophisticated stonework, featuring megalithic, multi-ton blocks carved from very hard stones like basalt and andesite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

The stones used often came from vast distances, sometimes over 350 miles away, indicating an advanced understanding of material properties and logistical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:22">[02:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:53">[02:35:53]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the locally abundant limestone that was often ignored by the builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:17">[02:19:17]</a>.

### Evidence of Advanced Technology and Catastrophic Events

At Kef Kesi, square basalt blocks exhibit "machine cuts" and levels of sophistication considered bizarre and mysterious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:07">[02:39:07]</a>. More strikingly, the surfaces of many stones, particularly those facing upwards, show evidence of vitrification, a literal melting of the stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. Dr. Robert Schoch confirmed this vitrification, which requires temperatures exceeding 2,000 degrees to melt basalt into a glass-like obsidian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:11">[02:41:11]</a>.

The region around Lake Van, particularly Mount Nemrut, experienced massive volcanic eruptions during the end of the Pliocene epoch, coinciding with the Older and Younger Dryas periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:50">[02:53:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:11">[02:54:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:23">[02:54:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:57">[02:54:57]</a>. These intense heat events could explain the vitrification found on the ancient structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. The severe weathering and degradation of stones at these sites also point to extreme temperature gradients and plasma events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>.

[!note|Theories on Lost Civilizations and Ancient Advanced Technology]
This discovery challenges the conventional view of history, suggesting a more advanced civilization existed before the Younger Dryas impact theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. The existence of precision cuts on stones that look machine-made implies the use of [[theories_on_lost_civilizations_and_ancient_advanced_technology | ancient advanced technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>.

## Underground Cities of Derinkuyu and Kaymakl覺

In Southern Turkey, the region of Cappadocia features a unique soft volcanic stone that allowed ancient civilizations to create massive subterranean areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

### Derinkuyu
Discovered in the last 40 years, Derinkuyu is an expansive underground city with over 30 levels of interchanging tunnels and rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. It includes air shafts, multi-ton stones capable of sealing off entrances, and areas for animals, education, bedding, and food storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>. It was capable of housing over 20,000 people and extends kilometers deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

### Kaymakl覺
Kaymakl覺, a sister city to Derinkuyu, was found just a few years later, located five and a half miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. A main corridor connects Derinkuyu all the way to Kaymakl覺 underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. This suggests that the builders understood it was not safe to be above ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>, possibly due to a "nuclear winter" or catastrophic climate, indicating a prior event their ancestors survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

Crucially, none of the excavated material from these underground cities has ever been found outside the entrance, nor have tools or other items been preserved, suggesting a very ancient age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. While later cultures like the Hittites reused them, archaeologists often mistakenly attribute construction to these later inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>. These cities are believed to have been built over 10,000 years ago, likely before the Younger Dryas catastrophes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

## Shared Global Symbolism and Architecture

The sites in Eastern Turkey display motifs and symbols found in other ancient sites worldwide, suggesting a shared core knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:51">[02:21:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.

### Connecting Turkey to Egypt and South America
The building style in Eastern Turkey, with its use of megalithic, hard stones and advanced precision, mirrors the [[mysteries_and_discoveries_of_ancient_egypt | ancient Egyptian structures]] like the Great Pyramid of Giza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:53">[02:18:53]</a>. The Sphinx in Egypt, for instance, shows [[mysteries_and_discoveries_of_ancient_egypt | water erosion]] and disproportionate head-to-body ratios, suggesting it was originally a lion carved around 10,500 BC and later retrofitted by dynastic Egyptians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. There are also indications of a vast [[mysteries_and_discoveries_of_ancient_egypt | subterranean network]] of rooms and cavities beneath the Sphinx and the entire Giza Plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

In South America, sites like Pumapunku and Tiwanaku in Bolivia, and Ke in Peru, exhibit the same andesite basalt stonework and identical symbols, including the Chana symbol and the cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:54">[02:59:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:54">[02:59:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:54">[02:59:54]</a>. The three-doorway concept seen in Tiwanaku is also mirrored at Shavu Tepe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:38">[02:57:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:38">[02:57:38]</a>. These connections suggest a [[exploration_and_lost_civilizations | maritime civilization]] that traveled globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:46">[03:43:46]</a>.

### Symbolic Language
The ancient civilization in Turkey appears to have communicated through symbolism rather than written language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:30">[03:45:30]</a>.

Key symbols found at these sites include:
*   **The Sun Cross**: This symbol, found at these sites, later became the Knights Templar cross and is seen in the Vatican <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>. It is believed to represent the balance of all harmonic things, pointing to a core concept of source or God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>.
*   **Pine Cone and Handbag**: These motifs are seen in Assyrian civilizations and are present at these Turkish sites, possibly representing the "passing of knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>. The giant pine cone outside the Vatican is cited as an example of this conserved symbolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>.
*   **Trinity/Three Levels**: The concept of three levels, resembling the Holy Trinity, is interpreted as representing the mind, body, and spirit, which, when balanced, lead to ascension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>. This teaching is believed to have been "lowered" at these sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>.
*   **Griffin and Hourglass**: The Griffin is seen as an ancient guardian, guarding the symbol of time (an hourglass), signifying the preservation of knowledge for eternity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>.

### Archaeological Misinterpretations
Mainstream archaeology often misinterprets these findings. For instance, the Urartians (a later Iron Age culture around 2000 BC) are credited with building these sites based on their cuneiform inscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>. However, the Urartians primarily built with mud brick and crude stone, and their culture lacked the sophisticated motifs and teachings found in the underlying structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>. The symbols often interpreted as "spearheads" are believed to be representations of "seeds of knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>.

This misattribution is attributed to "Ivory Tower" academia, where established narratives are difficult to challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>.

## Global Cataclysms and the Great Year

The discussion extends to ancient global catastrophic events and astronomical cycles:

### The Younger Dryas and Older Dryas
The [[graham_hancocks_theories_on_ancient_civilizations | Younger Dryas]] (around 12,000 years ago) and the Older Dryas (around 14,500 years ago) were periods of catastrophic climatic change marking the end of the last Ice Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. These events involved massive carbon spikes and rapid temperature shifts, with temperatures rising warmer than present levels in a few hundred years, then dropping colder than the Ice Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

### Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)
Instead of an impact event, a massive solar coronal mass ejection (CME) is proposed as the cause of these cataclysms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. A huge amount of heat hitting Earth could cause instant glacier melting, disrupting ocean currents like the Gulf Stream and leading to drastic temperature drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Evidence for CMEs includes vitrification (melting of stone) and widespread plasma discharges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

### The Binary Star Theory
The [[ancient_structures_and_their_potential_connections_to_extraterrestrial_technology | Great Year]] (a 25,000 to 26,000-year cycle) is linked to a binary star companion to our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Pioneer 10 and 11 probes in the 1970s and 1980s detected a large planet (Planet 9/10) and a "dead star" influencing our entire solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This dead star's elliptical orbit, bringing it closest to our sun every 12,500 years (parhelion), is theorized to cause massive solar energetic explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This could explain the cyclical catastrophes and the rise and fall of civilizations, as detailed in the Yuga Cycles of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

[!warning|Information Suppression]
Information regarding the Pioneer probes and this binary star theory, particularly the findings of astronomers Thomas Van Flandern and Robert Harrington, appears to have been deliberately suppressed or "scrubbed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Both astronomers died mysteriously of throat cancer in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This alleged cover-up suggests a motive to hide the knowledge of civilizational cycles that humanity may not be able to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

## Reinterpreting Ancient Myths: The Noah Story and Shuruppak

Ancient Sumerian cuneiform tablets, the oldest known writings on Earth, provide stories that challenge conventional historical narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>.

### The Epic of Gilgamesh and the Flood Hero
The Epic of Gilgamesh, Atrahasis, and Sumerian King List all contain nearly identical flood stories, featuring a "Noah figure" named Utnapishtim or Ziusudra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>. This suggests the Biblical Noah's Ark story was adopted from these earlier Mesopotamian accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>.

### The Discovery of Shuruppak
The ancient city of Shuruppak, where the Noah figure is said to have been the last king, was long considered a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>. However, in 1931, Shuruppak was found in Iraq, buried under layers of later civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>. A 3-4 foot thick alluvial flood layer was found directly above the oldest strata of Shuruppak, corresponding to the flood described in the ancient tablets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>. Ocean shells found on the zigurrat summit at nearby Eridu (also considered a myth until its discovery) further suggest a global flood, not merely a local river event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>.

These findings suggest that Shuruppak could be one of the oldest cities on Earth, potentially dating back tens of thousands of years, far earlier than conventionally believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Paradigm Shift in Understanding

The cumulative evidence from these Turkish sites, when combined with global parallels, challenges the established historical narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>. The precision stonework, the global sharing of symbols, the presence of vitrification, and the reinterpretation of ancient myths all point to a sophisticated [[theories_on_lost_civilizations_and_ancient_advanced_technology | lost civilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>. The existence of these sites, possibly dating back over 12,000 to 40,000 years, implies an advanced understanding of cosmology, geodesy, and the nature of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>.

This emerging understanding, often suppressed by mainstream archaeology, is poised to create a "Tipping Point" where new dating techniques and continued [[exploration_and_lost_civilizations | exploration]] may definitively prove the existence of these ancient [[lost_civilizations_and_shared_global_traditions | global civilizations]] and fundamentally shift humanity's perception of its own past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>.

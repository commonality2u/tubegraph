Psychic [[magicians_experiences_with_seemingly_miraculous_events | Uri Geller]] recounted an experience where he met Dr. Wernher von Braun, often referred to as the grandfather of the Space Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Despite von Braun's past as a Nazi, Geller's curiosity about the rocket genius led him to accept the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

During their [[uri_geller_meeting_with_werner_von_braun | meeting with Wernher von Braun]], von Braun presented Geller with a piece of metal, asking him to touch it and describe what he felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Geller touched the metal and stated that it didn't feel like it was "from here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Following this, von Braun invited Geller into his personal office, where he opened a safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Inside, Geller saw another piece of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He described its color as unlike anything he had ever seen and noted that it was not heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Von Braun again instructed Geller to touch this second piece of metal and report his sensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Geller placed his hand on it and reiterated that it was not "from here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

<h5>Von Braun's Revelation</h5>

<p>Von Braun confirmed Geller's intuition, stating, "You're right. This is a piece of a UFO that crashed on our planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Geller expressed profound astonishment at this revelation, particularly given his childhood interest in films about extraterrestrial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.</p>

The social media application TikTok, owned by its parent company ByteDance, has become a significant source of concern regarding data privacy and national security in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. The FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case approximately every 10 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

## TikTok's Data Collection and Monitoring
In 2022, it was revealed that ByteDance planned to use TikTok to monitor the location of specific American citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The company utilized an investigations team to gather data on the location of a U.S. citizen who was simply a TikTok consumer and had never worked for ByteDance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This means a Chinese company sought to use TikTok to spy on an American citizen on American soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, potentially targeting journalists, government officials, or human rights advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

The FBI director, Christopher Wray, has expressed extreme concern regarding TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. TikTok's terms of service include stipulations for collecting information such as IP address, user agent, device model, device system, network type, device IDs, screen resolution, operating system, app and file names, and key stroke patterns or rhythms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Furthermore, if a user logs in from multiple devices, the platform can use profile information to identify activity across all devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

These privacy issues are compounded by the fact that ByteDance is considered an extension of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The collected data, along with personal information from other Chinese-acquired platforms like the gay dating app Grinder (which includes users' HIV status), is believed to be stored on Chinese servers and could be used as "compromise material" in a cyber war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## TikTok vs. Douyin: A Strategic Difference
The content and purpose of TikTok in the West differ significantly from its Chinese counterpart, Douyin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. In the West, TikTok is characterized by "mindless garbage, pranks, nudity, and salacious content" that consumes users' attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The CCP is aware of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

In contrast, China's version, Douyin, is filled with science and engineering content, celebrating educational and athletic achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Douyin also features a "youth mode" that imposes a 5-second wait between videos, limits usage for children under 14 to 40 minutes a day, and prevents use after 10 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This divergence suggests a deliberate strategy by the CCP to culturally influence and potentially weaken Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## US Government Response
Numerous attempts have been made in the U.S. to prevent TikTok from storing American citizens' personal data on Chinese servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Former President Trump even compelled the proposed sale of an American TikTok spin-off to Oracle, but the buyout did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

On April 22, 2024, President Biden signed a bipartisan bill passed by Congress, which mandates that TikTok must shut down in the U.S. unless it is sold to an American company within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. As of the video's making, TikTok still retains its extensive data tracking stipulations in its terms of service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Broader Implications
TikTok is seen as a tool used by the CCP to sow discord and demoralize Americans by stoking tensions along specific social fractures like race, gender, and identity, which the CCP is acutely aware of in American culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Beyond TikTok, the broader strategy is part of China's long-term plan to displace America as the world's superpower and reshape the global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The FBI reported in April 2024 that Chinese government-linked hackers had successfully gained access to U.S. infrastructure, including telecommunications, energy, water, and other critical sectors, awaiting the opportune moment to strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the U.S. must understand the extent to which it is being undermined and co-opted to secure an independent and free future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. The mass surveillance of big Tech in the U.S. mirrors Chinese mass surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.

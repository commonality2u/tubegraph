From: [[jessemichels]] <br/> 

Graham Hancock, an internationally acclaimed best-selling author, is known for his highly acclaimed docu-series "Ancient Apocalypse," which a journalist at *The Guardian* described as "the most dangerous show on Netflix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>. Often described as a "pseudo archaeologist" who "cherry picks his data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>, Hancock's work challenges the modern historical narrative that civilization began in Mesopotamia 6,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. He argues that this narrative is "wrong and incomplete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a> and will "absolutely demand a rewrite of history as we know it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

## Core Hypothesis: Lost Civilization of the Ice Age

Hancock posits that the human species has been suffering from "Mass Amnesia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:09">[01:44:09]</a>. He suggests that hunter-gatherers might have been taught basic agriculture and astronomy by "Remnant survivors of an ancient civilization that was wiped out in a mass extinction event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>. Michael Shermer, a skeptic who debated Hancock on Joe Rogan's podcast, has acknowledged that Hancock "made a good case for my basic proposition that we're we're missing an episode of the human story that there may have been a forgotten [[lost_civilizations_and_shared_global_traditions | Lost Civilization]] of the Ice Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:24">[09:08:24]</a>.

## The Younger Dryas Impact Theory and Global Cataclysm

A central pillar of Hancock's argument is the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, which suggests that an asteroid from the Torrid meteor stream hit the Earth, causing a "global cataclysm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>. This event aligns almost perfectly with Plato's dates for the destruction of Atlantis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:01">[02:17:01]</a>.

> [!info] The Torrid Meteor Stream
The Torrid meteor stream formed when a massive comet entered our inner Solar System's orbit around 20,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:23">[11:53:23]</a>. This comet disintegrated into smaller debris, including Comet Encke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:40">[12:02:40]</a>. The southern Torrid streams cross Earth's orbit yearly from September to November, while the northern streams cross starting in mid to late October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:04">[12:10:04]</a>. These streams can cause "massive damage on Earth in the form of impacts and Air Bursts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:01">[12:25:01]</a>. The 1908 Tunguska event, which flattened 2,000 square miles of trees in Siberia, is strongly suggested to be part of the Torrid meteor stream due to its June 30th date, coinciding with the peak of the Torrid stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:40">[13:06:40]</a>. Dr. Alan West from the Comet Research Group points out that the next 30 years or so will involve crossing a "much more lumpy and much more dangerous part of the Tory meeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:10">[14:04:10]</a>.

Hancock emphasizes that there's "testimony from the Ancients here they're saying an enormous flood happened and that there was a time where there were only a few survivors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:12">[01:57:12]</a>. He highlights that hundreds of flood myths exist across cultures that had no contact with each other, asserting that the "amount of corroborating evidence for some flood having occurred is overwhelming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:48">[04:57:48]</a>. The biblical flood story is just one of "approximately 2,000 flood conditions" found globally, "clearly documenting a global phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:04">[11:18:04]</a>. These stories confirm the reality of "inconceivably gigantic floods that occurred at the end of the last icing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:03">[11:34:03]</a>.

### Atlantis as a Placeholder

While connecting to Plato's account, Hancock clarifies that he is "not claiming or insisting that there was a civilization that was actually called Atlantis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>. He uses "Atlantis" as a placeholder for an earlier, highly [[theories_on_lost_civilizations_and_ancient_advanced_technology | advanced civilization]] that was destroyed and swallowed by the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Plato's source for Atlantis was his ancestor Solon, who visited a temple in Egypt around 600 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:02">[16:40:02]</a>. There, priests described a former, highly [[theories_on_lost_civilizations_and_ancient_advanced_technology | advanced civilization]] destroyed "in a single Dreadful day and night" and "swallowed up by the Sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:18">[17:02:18]</a>. The date given by the priests was 9,000 years before 600 BC, which translates to 9600 BC or 11,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>. This date perfectly coincides with the end of the Younger Dryas period and "Meltwater Pulse 1B," a "massive sea level rise" that occurred "literally overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>.

## Critiques of Conventional Archaeology and New Discoveries

Hancock argues that the modern field of archaeology is relatively new, born "a mere 200 years ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:43">[03:05:43]</a>. The concept that civilization began in the Fertile Crescent 6,000 years ago was established only 200 years ago with the discovery of the capital cities of Assyria and Babylonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. As we [[exploration_and_lost_civilizations | explore and discover more ancient archaeological sites]], the dates for civilization progressively get older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:13">[03:28:13]</a>.

### Gobekli Tepe

A prime example is [[archaeological_findings_in_Turkey_related_to_ancient_civilizations | Gobekli Tepe]], an [[ancient_structures_and_their_potential_connections_to_extraterrestrial_technology | ancient structure]] in modern [[archaeological_findings_in_Turkey_related_to_ancient_civilizations | Turkey]] dating back as far as 9000 BC, involving the "complex assembly of 50 ton blocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:34">[03:37:34]</a>. Hancock states that it's not something a hunter-gatherer would just wake up and decide to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. He suggests an archaeological "Moore's Law": "the deeper we go the older human history gets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

> [!quote] Graham Hancock
> "I think it's extremely premature for archaeologists to be so confident in their model of the origins of civilization they should have some humility and allow some leg room for alternative suggestions to come in instead of just trying to smash down anybody who says something that doesn't agree with their model perhaps be just a little more warm-hearted a little more open yeah allow that and and see what's good in the in the alternative evidence as being presented rather than just trying to find bad things about it and have a more constructive dialogue instead of this you know we know best and we're going to smash you down and we're going to insult you and humiliate you and call you any names we can so childish really" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>

Vast areas of the Earth, including the Amazon forest and the Sahara Desert, remain "completely untouched and unnoticed by conventional archaeologists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, making claims of complete knowledge "the epitome of human hubris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## The Great Pyramid and Sphinx

Hancock notes that the Great Pyramid of Giza's "extremely precise alignment to true north" on a six million tonne monument is no easy task and "involves astronomy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:00">[51:16:00]</a>. Robert Bauval's Orion Correlation Theory, first published in 1994, points out the "stunningly similar pattern" between the three great pyramids on the Giza Plateau and the three stars of Orion's belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>. Orion represents the god Osiris in the ancient Egyptian system, and there's a worldwide tradition that the soul enters the afterlife journey through Orion's belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:11:00">[52:11:00]</a>.

He believes the [[ancient_structures_and_their_potential_connections_to_extraterrestrial_technology | Great Pyramid of Giza]] "sits on top of something much older" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:35:00">[55:35:00]</a>, including a subterranean chamber 100 feet beneath its base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:37:00">[55:37:00]</a>. Similarly, he argues the Great Sphinx is much older than conventionally believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10:00">[56:10:00]</a>. Geologist Robert Schoch's work on the Sphinx's precipitation-induced weathering indicates it was carved during a period of heavy rainfall, between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago (the Younger Dryas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:18:00">[56:18:00]</a>. Hancock, Schoch, and others hypothesize that the Sphinx was originally a lion, and its head was later recarved into a pharaoh's head by the ancient Egyptians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:08:00">[58:08:00]</a>.

## Speculations on Ancient Technologies and Abilities

Hancock speculates that [[ancient_structures_and_their_potential_connections_to_extraterrestrial_technology | ancient structures]] were built using "ancient engineering techniques to take techniques and technologies that we don't know about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[47:17:00]</a>. He suggests that "innate human abilities" such as telepathy and telekinesis might have been allowed to "fall into disuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:52:00">[47:52:00]</a>. He references Dr. Rupert Sheldrake's work on telephone telepathy as an example of suppressed abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:00">[48:40:00]</a>. He posits that moving 200-ton blocks of stone 350 feet in the air for the Great Pyramid might have involved "some ability or some technology that we have not embraced and that we do not understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:53:00">[49:53:00]</a>. He notes ancient Egyptian traditions that speak of priests levitating large blocks accompanied by chanting and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:14:00">[50:14:00]</a>.

## The Ark of the Covenant

Hancock's first venture into "historical mystery" was investigating the Ark of the Covenant, detailed in his book *The Sign and the Seal* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a>. He claims the Ark is kept in a chapel in Aksum, Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>. Ethiopian Jews, known as Falashas or Beta Israel, claim their ancestors brought the Ark to Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:49:00">[39:49:00]</a>. This aligns with historical evidence of a Jewish community on Elephantine Island in the Nile around 650 BC, who were driven out around 400 BC and migrated south along the Nile to Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>. The Ark was notably absent from Babylonian records of items stolen from the Temple of Jerusalem in 587 BC, suggesting it was gone earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33:00">[40:33:00]</a>.

Hancock also speculates on a connection between the Ark, Freemasonry, and the Templars. He found evidence that 18th-century Scottish traveler James Bruce of Kinnaird, who brought the Book of Enoch back from Ethiopia, was a speculative Freemason interested in the esoteric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a>. Hancock hypothesizes that an Ethiopian Prince, Lalibela, exiled in Jerusalem during the Crusades when Templars held the Temple Mount, might have tipped off the Templars about the Ark's location in Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:52:00">[45:52:00]</a>. Lalibela later returned to Ethiopia with a "strange force of people who installed him on the throne" and built incredible rock-hewn churches, one of which has a Templar cross on its ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>.

## Role of Psychedelics and Consciousness Evolution

Hancock's work also delves into the [[influence_of_hallucinogens_in_ancient_cultures | influence of hallucinogens in ancient cultures]]. He believes that a "Quantum Leap Forward in human behavior and in human consciousness" was the result of "experimenting with psychedelics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>. He cites Terence McKenna's book *Food of the Gods* as one of the first to suggest this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>.

> "I believe God left certain drugs growing naturally Upon Our Planet to help speed up and facilitate our evolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>

He notes that the consumption of ergot, which grows naturally on wheat, barley, and rye (early agricultural crops), could have spurred ideas that created modern civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>. He argues that shamanism teaches that plants and fungi are "teachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>, providing "teachings" about personal behavior during deep [[influence_of_hallucinogens_in_ancient_cultures | psychedelic]] journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>. He himself received the entire plot of a novel, *Entangled*, during [[influence_of_hallucinogens_in_ancient_cultures | Ayahuasca]] sessions in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:30:00]</a>.

Hancock also explores the connection between psychedelics and [[impact_of_ancient_religions_on_modern_perception | ancient religions]]. He points out that early Christianity was "very much a [[influence_of_hallucinogens_in_ancient_cultures | psychedelic]] religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>, and that the Roman Catholic Church later emerged to oppress these other Christian sects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>. The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD arbitrarily cut down Christianity into an accepted canon, discounting books like the Gospel of Thomas that emphasized an individual's ability to ascend to a divine state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>. He suggests that the Eleusinian Mystery rituals involved a drink called "kykeon," leading to "extraordinary life-changing experiences," including overcoming the fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>.

Psychedelics offer access to a "completely different state of consciousness" beyond the "alert problem-solving state of consciousness" valued by modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>. They "break very blocked and narrow ways of thinking" that contribute to conditions like depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20:00">[25:20:00]</a>. He recounts his own experience with depression and weaning off pharmaceutical drugs, noting that placebos are often as effective as SSRI antidepressants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>.

## Views on Aliens and Consciousness

Hancock believes the idea of physical aliens in spaceships is a "materialist proposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. Instead, he aligns with Amazonian Shaman Pablo Amaringo, who said that "flying saucers" in his visions were "vehicles for entering and leaving the spirit world," which Hancock interprets as a "parallel dimension or a parallel realm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>. He credits Jacques Vallee's *Passport to Magonia* for recognizing the "incredible phenomenological parallels" between medieval fairies/elves and modern aliens, including abduction, surgery, and hybrid babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. This phenomenology is documented in cave art going back tens of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. He had his own "atypical Alien Encounter" during an [[influence_of_hallucinogens_in_ancient_cultures | Ayahuasca]] journey where he saw flying saucers and characteristic alien faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>.

Hancock highlights ongoing research at Imperial College London by Christopher Timmerman, which explores the [[speculations_on_consciousness_and_its_connection_to_ancient_legends | phenomenology]] of [[influence_of_hallucinogens_in_ancient_cultures | DMT]]-induced entity encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. The consistent stories from volunteers about encountering the same entities suggest these experiences are "real" despite societal prejudices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. He emphasizes that DMT exists in all organic material and is naturally made by the human body at significant times like identity formation in the womb, REM sleep, and near-death experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

Hancock believes [[speculations_on_consciousness_and_its_connection_to_ancient_legends | Consciousness]] is "fundamental to the universe," like gravity, and does not require physical bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>. Physical bodies act as a "filter or a reduction" on a "default state of Greater knowledge and understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

## Civilizational Cycles

Hancock believes "Civilization is cyclical that things come and go great civilizations rise and fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. He uses the example of the Indus Valley Civilization, discovered only in the 1920s and 1930s, as a "lost civilization" that was "extraordinarily sophisticated" and over 5,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. This demonstrates that "civilizations can get lost" and "can rise and can fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

Hancock maintains that while he does not deny evolution, he believes it is only "a tiny fraction story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>. He suggests that beneath the layer of Darwinian evolution, "is a whole other layer that's going on which is directed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>. He advocates for humanity to "graduate beyond that simplistic tribal level" of hatred and conflict to realize its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.

## Overview of Disclosures
[[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | David Grusch]], a former intelligence official and Afghanistan combat veteran, has publicly disclosed information about a covert government program aimed at recovering crashed alien spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Three military veterans, including [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]], were set to speak publicly about their experiences and what they learned "behind closed doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Background and Investigation
[[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] served as a 14-year high-ranking intelligence officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. In 2019, the Pentagon tasked him with investigating UFOs as part of the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) Task Force (UAPTF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Initially, he had no interest in UFOs, but found the investigation "interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

During his investigation, [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] began uncovering a program systematically hidden from him, the American public, and elected representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This program's mandate was to find and retrieve crashed UFOs and attempt to rebuild them into functional vehicles that humans could fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

He noted that colleagues he had known for years approached him, informing him about "other stuff" they were not getting access to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. These individuals had kept the secret for many years and wanted change, feeling limited in their support and experiencing harsh treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] confirmed the existence of exotic craft based on specific properties like engineered isotopic ratios and classified intel reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Access to this information was repeatedly denied to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## [[whistleblower_protection_regarding_uap_disclosures | Whistleblower Protections]] and Public Disclosure
Thanks to new [[whistleblower_protection_regarding_uap_disclosures | UFO whistleblower protections]], [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] provided comprehensive documentation about these programs to the Inspector General in the summer of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. He brought people directly involved in secret UFO programs to meet the Inspector General's team, providing names of aerospace companies and locations where UFOs were ostensibly kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Inspector General's office found his claims credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

In June 2023, [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] identified himself publicly, giving exclusive interviews to News Nation and The Debrief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. In late July, he testified before Congress in Washington, D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Key Revelations from Testimony and Interviews
*   **Non-Human Biologics:** [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] stated that "biologics came with some of these recoveries" and confirmed them to be non-human, based on the assessment of people with direct knowledge currently on the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. He described this as a "mind blowing side of it" that "throws you for a loop psychologically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Pre-publication Approval:** [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]]'s public statements were subject to the DoD Pre-Publication and Security Review (DOPSR) process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. He explained that approval was a "catch 22" for the government, as any redaction would require self-identification of the concerned office and citation of the security classification guide, which he would then publish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. His goal was to disclose enough "most sensitive parts" like the biologic side to "put the flag out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.

## Challenges and Motivation for Disclosure
[[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] explained that he was very careful to ensure he wasn't "getting fed some bullshit" by talking to nearly 40 people, many of whom he had known for years and trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>. He also sought out sources who didn't know each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.

He has experienced incidents that caused him to fear for his life for addressing these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] described the psychological pressure on government workers to maintain secrecy, including threats of losing jobs, pensions, clearances, and even being charged with treason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. He became a "mouthpiece" and "shepherd" for others who wanted to disclose privately to the appropriate people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.

[[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] believes the secrecy hinders national supremacy because it prevents the recruitment of top talent, such as a theoretician who might smoke marijuana and thus cannot get clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>. He argues that opening up the information would enhance national security and peer competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:06">[01:41:06]</a>.

> "If everything's in secret, everybody can get away with things that might be illegal, unethical, immoral." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:12">[01:41:12]</a>

## Historical Context of Secrecy
The origins of [[ufo_disclosure_and_secrecy | government secrecy]] surrounding UFOs date back decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Early concerns included societal resistance to change, potential "religious ontological shocks" due to a less secular society at the time, and a desire to prevent Russia and China from gaining an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

### Manhattan Project and Classification
[[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] discussed how the [[role_of_military_and_government_in_ufo_secrecy | ecosystem of secrecy]] from the Manhattan Project was overlaid onto UFO-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Robert Oppenheimer, involved in the Manhattan Project, created the classification that included UFO-related material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 defined "special nuclear material" broadly, allowing for secrecy of retrieved crash material with radiological energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

Nathan Twining, head of Air Force aircraft development in 1947, acknowledged the reality of UFOs in a memo, but also suggested that any American programs to build similar craft should be set up "independently of existing projects" due to high cost and time commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. This suggests a desire for compartmentalized, [[ufo_disclosure_and_coverups | black projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official UFO investigation program in the 1950s and 60s, was primarily a "propaganda mouthpiece" to downplay the phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. This indicates that a "real deeper program" likely existed, possibly tied to the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. These programs were likely housed in facilities like Wright-Patterson Air Force Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

## Implications and Future Outlook
[[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] believes the existence of these phenomena demands a deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. He stresses that the public deserves to know the truth, especially if it answers fundamental questions like "Are we alone?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.

He noted that high-level officials, including Senators Schumer and Rubio, have acknowledged that "a bunch of freaking high-level officers came to us and either they're crazy or this shit's real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:56">[01:33:56]</a>. Schumer was compelled to write a 64-page amendment mentioning "non-human tech" and "recoveries," which is expected to become law, putting the executive branch "in a bind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>.

[[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | Grusch]] stated that the phenomenon is global, with reports from Russia, China, and the Ariel School incident in Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:56">[01:35:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. He encourages those still on the program to use legal processes for disclosure, emphasizing the importance of transparency for national security and ethical oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>.

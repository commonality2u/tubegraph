Danny Sheehan is presented as having a deep understanding of major 20th-century American conspiracies, partly due to his personal involvement as an attorney and "people's advocate" in many of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His work has spanned cases such as Watergate, the Karen Silkwood investigation, and representing UFO whistleblowers Lou Elizondo, John Mack, and Steven Greer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## The UFO Phenomenon and Covert Government Programs

The UFO phenomenon is a significant focus, with recent public discussions around official disclosures.

### Recent Disclosure Efforts and Legislation

In July 2023, David Grusch from the National Geospatial Agency testified before Congress, alleging the existence of legacy reverse engineering programs and crash retrievals of UFOs, including "non-human biologics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Grusch claims to have brought forward 40 firsthand witnesses to the Inspector General of the intelligence community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

While public congressional hearings might be "dog and pony shows," significant activity occurs behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. A controlled disclosure process began around late 2017 with the *New York Times* front-page story featuring Lou Elizondo and Chris Mellon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This story, including videos, was authorized by the United States Defense Department's pre-publication review office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The intentionally low-quality nature of the released videos is seen as a form of "conditioning" or "Rorschach test" for public reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

A major piece of legislation, the Schumer Amendment to the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), aimed to set up a controlled disclosure campaign over seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. A key part of this law orders all six U.S. military services and all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies, plus 32 Defense Department agencies, to gather all information on the UFO phenomenon and "non-human intelligence" by October 20, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This compiled data is to be made available to the National Archives and relevant congressional intelligence committees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

The original bill also included a provision for the government to declare eminent domain over non-human craft possessed by private aerospace companies, but this was removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This removal is attributed to figures like Mike Turner, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, whose top donors include large aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. These companies view UFO technology as a potential source of profit, seeking patent rights for future licensing to the U.S. government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### Extraterrestrial Contact and Beings

Danny Sheehan states that thousands of people have had face-to-face and telepathic contact with extraterrestrial beings, a fact often ignored by official narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

Psychologist and UFO researcher John Mack, head of the Harvard Psychiatry department, seriously investigated cases of alien abduction and direct contact experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Sheehan represented Mack for 10 years, vetting dozens of witnesses, some of whom were "absolutely totally credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

Sheehan recounts a deathbed confession from Albert Stein, a U.S. Army clerk typist assigned to Project Blue Book, who witnessed an interview with an extraterrestrial being at S4 in Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. According to Stein, there were over 700 UFO sightings that Project Blue Book couldn't debunk, and the being, which was 5.5 to 6 feet tall with a light blue jumpsuit, telepathically communicated that it was from a group of beings from different star systems in our galaxy, monitoring life on various planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. This being described a coordinating entity that humans "would refer to as God" but is "very different" from common understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

Another account involves Barbara Lamb, a psychologist who counseled dozens of people with direct contact experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. After 50 years of interviews, she had a direct encounter with a "reptilian guy" who appeared in her living room, conveying a friendly message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

These experiences, particularly with "hominid" non-human intelligences, challenge conventional evolutionary convergence theories, suggesting a potential connection to mankind or different timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.

### Consciousness and Parapsychology
The UFO phenomenon is deeply connected to consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. Extraterrestrials monitor human consciousness and use it to navigate their craft telepathically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

Government programs have extensively studied "remote viewing" and other psychic faculties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. Pat Price, a remote viewer, could accurately describe classified CIA facilities, including reading files from a cabinet, and could pinpoint the location of Russian nuclear submarines, often noting UFOs tracking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. Ingo Swann, another remote viewer, was reportedly a spy for the Church of Scientology, feeding them information on the Office of Naval Intelligence's remote viewing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. Scientology's highest principle reportedly involves a "major confrontation" between human-like beings from the Pleiades and reptilians from Zeta Reticuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.

Another remote viewing experiment involved using a helmet and large antennas to telepathically project a message to people in Michigan, resulting in 85% compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

Sheehan asserts that an element within U.S. government and military intelligence has direct knowledge of extraterrestrial beings on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. While not explicitly confirming treaties, he suggests a "tacit understanding" for coexistence, with both sides avoiding full public disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>.

### Project Blue Book and a Personal Sighting
As special counsel to a study requested by President Jimmy Carter in 1977, Danny Sheehan gained access to the classified files of Project Blue Book at the National Archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. Carter, who had a personal UFO sighting in 1969, sought a briefing from the CIA (then headed by George H.W. Bush) upon his election, but was reportedly refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>.

During his review, Sheehan found photos of a "crash retrieval of a UFO" in a snowy field, a classic saucer-shaped craft, approximately 40 feet wide, with discernable symbols around its base, which he personally traced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:33">[01:22:33]</a>. He describes the encounter as instinctive and potentially dangerous, as he was nearly caught with his tracings by security personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>.

## The Assassination of John F. Kennedy (JFK)

Sheehan claims precise knowledge of who killed JFK and the motivations behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

### The "S Force" and Its Creation

The assassination was carried out by a 15-man unit, the "S Force," created in 1960 by then-Vice President Richard Nixon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. This force was initially intended to assassinate Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and Che Guevara, to prevent Cuba from establishing diplomatic relations with Russia or China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>.

Nixon allegedly contacted Howard Hughes, a secret consultant to the National Security Council, who then tasked his lawyer, Bob Maheu, with setting up the assassination team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Maheu, in turn, approached mafia figures Johnny Roselli and Sam Giancana in Las Vegas, who then involved Santos Trafficante, the "da" of the mafia in Havana who had fled to Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:04">[01:39:04]</a>. The operation was ultimately greenlighted by Sheffield Edwards, the chief of security for the CIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:28">[01:42:28]</a>. Trafficante selected 15 former Cuban gunmen, who were also covertly recruited by the CIA for "Operation 40" against Cuba, to form the "S Force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:56">[01:42:56]</a>.

### Kennedy's Downfall

The Kennedy administration was initially unaware of the "S Force" because it was set up "off the shelf" by Nixon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:28">[01:44:28]</a>. After the Bay of Pigs failure, Kennedy promised Cuban refugees to "fly the free flag of Cuba over the island before the end of his second term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>. Despite telling Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev he would halt covert operations against Cuba, Kennedy continued them under "Operation Mongoose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:10">[01:45:10]</a>. This deception led to the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:19">[01:46:19]</a>.

Traumatized by the near-destruction of the world, Kennedy and Khrushchev began a secret, direct communication channel, exchanging 18 letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:32">[01:47:32]</a>. They agreed to personally use their executive authority to begin disassembling the nuclear warheads of their respective arsenals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:11">[01:48:11]</a>.

Allen Dulles, the first civilian head of the CIA and a former partner at Brown Brothers Harriman, discovered this secret disarmament plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:28">[01:48:28]</a>. Dulles and others viewed Kennedy as a "traitor" for covertly disassembling the primary military capacity of the U.S., particularly against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:21">[01:49:21]</a>. With the "green light" from the influential Brown Brothers Harriman group, the "S Force" was tasked with assassinating Kennedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:35">[01:59:35]</a>.

George H.W. Bush, J. Edgar Hoover, and Lyndon B. Johnson were reportedly notified of the impending assassination before it happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:53">[01:59:53]</a>. Roger Morales, the "dead-eye shot" of the team, killed Kennedy from the grassy knoll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>.

### The Role of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby

Lee Harvey Oswald was part of a plan to take a shot at Kennedy (not to kill him) to be blamed and linked to Cuba, leading to a rationale for an attack on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:43">[02:02:43]</a>. The plan was for Officer Tippit to kill Oswald after the shot, presenting a "lone gunman" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:20">[02:05:20]</a>. However, Oswald killed Tippit when approached, realizing he was "getting screwed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:49">[02:05:49]</a>. Jack Ruby, a "mob guy," was then directed by the mob to kill Oswald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:56">[02:04:56]</a>.

### RFK Assassination Connection

RFK Jr. reportedly believes his father, Robert F. Kennedy, was not killed by Sirhan Sirhan but by Eugene Thi Caine, who was coordinating with Bob Maheu (Howard Hughes's lawyer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>.

## Watergate Scandal

The Watergate scandal is presented as having deeper layers beyond common understanding.

### The "S Force" Connection

The key to understanding Watergate is the involvement of four "Trafficante guys" from the "S Force" assassination team: E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, the Cuban burglars, and James McCord (a CIA wiretapping specialist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:14">[02:19:14]</a>. Nixon's "Smoking Gun" conversation refers to Howard Hunt and the fear that investigating a Mexican bank account (where money for the Cuban assassination team came from) would expose the "assassination team" and link it back to Nixon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:59">[02:21:59]</a>.

### Nixon's Paranoia and Larry O'Brien

Nixon's decision to order the break-in was driven by paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:08">[02:24:08]</a>. The DNC office they targeted belonged to Larry O'Brien, who had been a major lobbyist for Howard Hughes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:03">[02:23:03]</a>. Nixon feared that if O'Brien learned about the 1960 assassination team, it would "lead back to the fact that they're the ones that killed the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:33">[02:23:33]</a>. The "shooter team" members were used in the break-in because they knew what to look for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:17">[02:24:17]</a>.

### James McCord and Mark Felt (Deep Throat)

James McCord, the CIA wiretapping specialist involved in the break-in, reportedly believed he was participating in a national security operation against anti-Vietnam War demonstrations coordinated by the DNC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:53">[02:29:53]</a>. When he felt "sold out," he wrote the letter to Judge John Sirica, blowing the whistle on Nixon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:11">[02:30:11]</a>.

Mark Felt (Deep Throat), the FBI Deputy Director, was reportedly motivated by revenge for being passed over for the FBI directorship and by a desire to pursue the investigation into the Mexican bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:20">[02:31:20]</a>.

## Pre-WWII and WWII Conspiracies

### Funding of Nazis and the CIA's Origins

Sheehan claims that American industrialists and financiers secretly funded the Nazis before World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. The intention was for Hitler to establish a "fascist government," where the government's instrumentalities were placed "at the disposal of the interests of the private corporations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. Figures like Henry Ford reportedly had ideological sympathies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. This funding went through entities like the Union Bank of New York, capitalized by investors from Brown Brothers Harriman, and its Dutch subsidiary, the Bank of Shipping and Commerce, run by Fritz Thyssen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:17">[01:53:17]</a>.

The CIA itself was the "brainchild" of individuals at Brown Brothers Harriman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. Robert Lovett, a senior partner there, reportedly wrote the original memo to Truman recommending the creation of the CIA and its covert operations capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. Brown Brothers Harriman was a collective investment company representing the "richest 25 patrones from the robber barons" (Gilded Age families) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>. They funded German war reparations after WWI, taking stock in major German military companies as security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:58">[01:52:58]</a>.

### Plot to Overthrow FDR

In 1934, Brown Brothers Harriman and the Gilded Age families (Carnegies, Rockefellers) allegedly planned to overthrow President Franklin D. Roosevelt's government, attempting to recruit Marine Corps General Smedley Butler to lead a veteran's insurrection and establish a fascist government in the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:36">[01:55:36]</a>.

### Pearl Harbor Pre-Knowledge

Sheehan states that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had "100% confidence" of foreknowledge regarding the Pearl Harbor attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:16">[01:58:16]</a>. Roosevelt reportedly "lured the Japanese in" to provoke an attack that would rally American public support for war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:50">[01:57:50]</a>. He allegedly ordered all aircraft carriers to leave Pearl Harbor under cover of night the day before the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:31">[01:58:31]</a>. The U.S. never declared war on Germany directly; Germany declared war on the U.S. after Pearl Harbor due to their Axis alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>.

## MKUltra and Mind Control

Sheehan discusses his involvement in the only successful case against MKUltra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:01">[02:09:01]</a>.

### LSD as an Interrogation Device

The purpose of MKUltra was initially to use LSD as an interrogation device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>. The theory was that LSD would "dissolve away the boundaries" of a subject's concept structures, including loyalty and secrecy, making them susceptible to revealing information under interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>.

Sheehan recounts a case where a tennis pro undergoing counseling was unknowingly given massive doses of LSD at a New York City hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:12">[02:10:12]</a>. He died of a heart attack after the second dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:39">[02:10:39]</a>. The subsequent cover-up involved lawyers from the U.S. Army and the intelligence community, including Jacob Javits (later a U.S. Senator) and Warren Burger (later Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. When their involvement was revealed in discovery, the judge immediately ordered a settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:42">[02:11:42]</a>.

### Creation of Killers and Social Control

Beyond interrogation, MKUltra may have aimed to "construct killers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:39">[02:13:39]</a>. The case of [[charles_manson_and_the_influence_of_government_experiments | Charles Manson]], who was allegedly an MKUltra patient, is cited as a possible example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:51">[02:12:51]</a>. The theory is that creating figures like Manson served to marginalize and make an example of movements like the hippie counterculture, achieving "mass pacification through local violence creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>.

## Karen Silkwood Case

Karen Silkwood, a health and safety person at a nuclear reprocessing plant, discovered a 40-pound discrepancy of "98% bomb grade plutonium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>. She believed it was due to sloppiness, but it was reportedly being trafficked to Israel for nuclear weapons in violation of non-proliferation treaties, with a condition to share with Iran under the Shah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:33">[02:45:33]</a>. This operation was allegedly facilitated by the [[cia_operations_and_their_role_in_american_historical_events | Central Intelligence Agency]], specifically Theodore Shackley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Silkwood was killed when her car was rammed off the road on her way to meet a *New York Times* reporter, and the documents she carried were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:24">[02:46:24]</a>.

## Danny Sheehan's Investigative Methodology

Sheehan attributes his ability to navigate complex conspiracies to his training in "Bayes' theorem" for setting out options and working with experienced private investigators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:16">[02:48:16]</a>. He emphasizes taking in information, storing it as "cards on the wall," and connecting threads, rather than adhering to a single *a priori* theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:50">[02:55:50]</a>. He highlights the challenge of doing this work in a world where the [[the_role_of_intelligence_operations_in_postwwii_america | National Security State]] intentionally distorts reality and penetrates "epistemological sources of authority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:03">[02:55:03]</a>.

The [[MK Ultra and CIA mind control techniques | MK Ultra program]], a top-secret CIA mind control initiative, began in the early 1950s around the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Its primary goal was to brainwash individuals using [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] and other substances, potentially leading them to commit acts like murder on command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Despite most of the program's records being destroyed, correspondence between psychiatrist Dr. Joly West and the CIA's Sidney Gottlieb confirms West's high-ranking involvement in [[MK Ultra and CIA mind control techniques | MK Ultra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Dr. Joly West and Jack Ruby

Dr. Joly West, a renowned psychiatrist and later chair of UCLA's psychiatry department, was deeply involved in the CIA's brainwashing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. West was also the psychiatrist for Jack Ruby, the individual who shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald, the supposed lone gunman in the assassination of JFK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Ruby had no history of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He reportedly blacked out after shooting Oswald, asking, "How did I get here? Why are you doing this to me? I'm Jack Ruby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This amnesia aligns with West's earlier stated goal to Gottlieb: to induce mental illness in a person without their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Months into Ruby's prison sentence, West met with him for a few hours without cameras, emerging to declare Ruby had a psychotic break, after which Ruby remained psychologically unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson]] and [[MK Ultra and CIA mind control techniques | MK Ultra]]

Journalist Tom O'Neill's book, *Chaos: [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson]], the CIA, and the Secret History of the 60s*, suggests an alternative narrative to the conventional story of [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. O'Neill's investigation, spanning 20 years, proposes that [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson]] was a CIA construct involved in [[MK Ultra and CIA mind control techniques | MK Ultra]] and the government's efforts to destroy the [[impact_of_mk_ultra_on_hippie_and_counterculture_movements | hippie movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Manson, initially an aspiring musician and petty criminal, transformed into a cult leader with complete control over 30 to 40 followers by 1969, leading them to commit murders without remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This transformation reportedly began in the summer of love, 1967, in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic

During this period, Dr. Joly West used the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic, run by David Smith, as a recruiting pool for hippies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. While the clinic publicly claimed to only provide medical care, it became a site for "Operation Midnight Climax," a declassified CIA program where subjects were unknowingly dosed with [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson]] was a frequent visitor to this clinic and was "more than likely" one of these unwitting test subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. His transformation from a con man to a cult leader with intense mind control over his followers occurred exactly in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Other Anomalies Suggesting Manipulation

*   **Spahn Ranch Surveillance:** Spahn Ranch, the Manson family's residence, was under surveillance for months before the Tate murders, yet authorities did not intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Reeve Whitson:** A mysterious individual named Reeve Whitson, whose family and friends believed he was CIA, was frequently seen around Sharon Tate's home. He arrived at Tate's house before the police after the murders, suggesting he was either conducting surveillance or had prior knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Roger Smith (Parole Officer):** Manson's parole officer, Roger Smith, repeatedly negotiated his release despite Manson's petty crimes in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Smith was an expert in [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]], amphetamines, and their effects on violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Manson and Smith shared an unusually close relationship, with Manson affectionately calling Smith "Jubal," a character from his favorite book, *Stranger in a Strange Land* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Given Manson was mostly illiterate, it's theorized the book might have been read to him while he was under the influence of [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Motivation to Discredit the [[impact_of_mk_ultra_on_hippie_and_counterculture_movements | Hippie Movement]]

The U.S. government, particularly figures like J. Edgar Hoover and Ronald Reagan, believed the youth movement was funded by communist Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. They sought to marginalize the [[impact_of_mk_ultra_on_hippie_and_counterculture_movements | hippie movement]], viewing it as a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Programs like COINTELPRO and CHAOS, run by the FBI and CIA, tracked dissident members of the [[impact_of_mk_ultra_on_hippie_and_counterculture_ment | hippie and free love movements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

The media portrayal of the Manson family after their identification on December 1, 1969, featured images of long-haired hippies accused of senseless killings, described as "burnt out on acid" and easily manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This depiction contributed to the perception that long-haired hippies were cold-blooded killers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This narrative significantly damaged the charisma of the free love movement, leading author Joan Didion to state that August 9, 1969, was the day the 1960s abruptly ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

While there is no definitive "smoking gun," the conventional narrative surrounding [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson]] appears to be incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

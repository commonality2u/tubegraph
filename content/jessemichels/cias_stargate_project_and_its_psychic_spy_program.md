The [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate Project]] was a [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_spying | psychic spy program]] run by the [[cia_involvement_in_ufo_research | CIA]] from 1972 to 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Its participants, known as [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_espionage | remote viewers]], were trained to use their minds to gather intelligence on targets such as Russian nuclear bases and lost American hostages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## What is Remote Viewing?

Remote viewing is a disciplined method of organizing perceptual experiences and consciousness to access and perceive information about locations, persons, and objects that are physically distant or otherwise inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This ability challenges the conventional understanding of consciousness, which is typically seen as limited by the five senses and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Paul Smith, a former remote viewer in the Stargate Project, uses a television analogy to explain consciousness in the context of remote viewing:
> "That TV is not generating the TV program that you're watching, transmitting that's coming over the airwaves right... that's exactly the same kind of thing that you might be doing with the brain when you're shutting pieces down and seeing it affect consciousness... that is an evidence to show that physicalism is wrong... the transmission concept of consciousness is far more likely to be true than the physicalist model where it's all in the brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

The ability to perceive distant phenomena, which defies the physicalist model, supports the idea that consciousness might be more of a receiver or a conduit rather than solely a product of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Training in Remote Viewing

Training in remote viewing involves recognizing a subtle signal and distinguishing it from "mental noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The "left brain" or ego often tries to interpret or solve the problem, leading to misinterpretations (e.g., mistaking crisscrossing metal girders of the Eiffel Tower for a bridge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. A key component of remote viewing training is a "zen" approach, focusing on the process rather than the outcome and learning not to care about success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Origins of Stargate

The Stargate Project was initiated after laser physicist Hal Putoff conducted experiments with New York City-based psychic Ingo Swann in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Swann, who had experienced out-of-body phenomena since childhood, believed his abilities could be developed into a rigorous [[remote_viewing_and_parapsychology | remote viewing]] protocol for distant objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. When Swann accurately remote viewed the readouts of a highly shielded cork detector, it captured the attention of high-level officials in the Defense Department, leading the [[cia_involvement_in_ufo_research | CIA]] to launch the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Notable Successes

The [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate Project]] achieved several notable successes that have since been declassified:

*   **Typhoon Submarine (1979)**: Joe McMoneagle, popularly known as "Remote Viewer Number One," was tasked with viewing a heavily fortified building in a Russian shipyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. He described a massive nuclear submarine under construction, specifically noting its ballistic missile tubes were located in front of the sail—a design considered "unheard of" and initially dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Eight months later, Russia unveiled the Typhoon submarine, the largest ever built, with its missile tubes indeed positioned exactly as McMoneagle had described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Downed Tu-22 Spy Plane (1979)**: Both American and Russian forces were searching for a downed Tu-22 spy plane containing sensitive Russian cryptic equipment in Zaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Satellite imagery was insufficient due to the triple-canopy forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Rosemary Smith, another remote viewer, was given a picture of the plane and a map of the entire African continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. She identified a three-square-mile area where the plane was located, within which it was subsequently found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. President Jimmy Carter later recalled being shocked by the accuracy of the psychic medium in locating the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **USS Stark Incident (1987)**: During the Iran-Iraq War, Paul Smith was tasked with identifying the most important information to know within the next few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. He described a vessel resembling an American destroyer, an aircraft dropping two cylinders with stubby wings making roaring sounds, and the vessel subsequently being engulfed in smoke and flames, leaning to one side, and crumpled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Days later, news broke that the USS Stark, a U.S. frigate, had been hit by Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi jet, precisely as Smith had described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Declassification and Resources

The Stargate Project was declassified as a program in 2017, and its files are now available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   For further reading on [[remote_viewing_and psychic spying | remote viewing]], Paul Smith's book, *The Essential Guide to Remote Viewing*, is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The successes of the [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate Project]] and other [[mind_control_and_remote_viewing_programs | parapsychological research]] challenge the prevailing scientific "physicalist" paradigm, which struggles to explain phenomena like [[remote_viewing_and_parapsychology | remote viewing]] within its framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Despite compelling evidence, there are inherent difficulties in instrumentalizing and scaling such abilities for predictable technological application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

The field of [[remote_viewing_and_parapsychology | parapsychology]] has received minimal funding compared to conventional physics—less than $30 million globally in the last 100 years, equivalent to less than the cost of a single particle accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. However, the dramatic implications of [[the_intersection_of_psionics_and_ufo_technology | parapsychology]] for science and human understanding suggest it warrants significantly more investigation and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

Since June 25th, 2021, the Pentagon has acknowledged the existence of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) in our sky that cannot be explained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This report represents a shift in how the U.S. government addresses [[UFOs and Government Disclosure | UFOs and Government Disclosure]].

## Government History and Secrecy

The U.S. government has a documented history of creating "fake threats" and staging "false flag incidents" to establish conditions for war and increase defense funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This raises the question of whether the belief in harmful aliens could be a staged event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

However, the idea of [[UFO Disclosure and Coverups | UFOs as a false flag]] is challenged by the presence of a "critical number of sober, competent," and seemingly non-intelligence-associated fighter pilots who claim to have seen [[UFO Disclosure and Coverups | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Commander David Fravor, for instance, reported seeing the famous "Tic Tac" object in 2004 off the coast of San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The military's culture generally discourages dishonesty and attention-seeking, making pilots hesitant to report such sightings unless they genuinely occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Despite the Pentagon's acknowledgment, the June 25th report itself suggests an internal tension, with one "authorial voice that wanted to disclose more" and another that resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Currently, the public remains reliant on the government for [[Government Secrecy and UFO Disclosure | UFO disclosure]], as they possess all the relevant data, footage, and materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Historical Government Engagement with UFOs

The government's relationship with UAPs has been described as "curious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. From 1947 to 1952, the U.S. government displayed an initial open-mindedness towards investigating [[UFO sightings and government secrecy | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This period saw the establishment of the Air Force's UFO investigation program, Operation Blue Book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Crashes like those at Trinity and Roswell, alongside sightings such as Kenneth Arnold's, contributed to a growing belief in "something there" among government officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

A significant shift occurred in July 1952 with an overwhelming series of sightings in Washington D.C., dubbed the "invasion of Washington" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This event prompted the CIA to issue a memo stating that the [[UFO disclosure and secrecy | UFO phenomena]] was a "matter of national security" and could "touch off mass hysteria and panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Subsequently, a commission formed by Caltech physicist Dr. H.P. Robertson recommended that the government "systematically downplay the phenomena through media, movies, and other means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Following this, leaders of Project Blue Book publicly expressed skepticism about extraterrestrial explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The 1968 Condon Report officially closed Blue Book, dismissing many of its findings with "prosaic explanations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

This period of official downplaying lasted until 2017, when New York Times journalist Leslie Kean revealed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (ATIP), a government [[UFO disclosure and secrecy | UFO investigation program]] that had been formed in 2007 and was run under Bigelow Aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Scientific Pursuit of UAP Data

Harvard astronomer Dr. Avi Loeb initiated the Galileo Project to independently investigate the nature of unusual objects identified by the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:16]</a>. The project aims to build its own observatories equipped with optical, radar, magnetic, infrared, and audio sensors to collect "more conclusive and publicly available data on UAPs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:34]</a>.

Dr. Loeb emphasizes that scientific investigation of UAPs requires instrumental data, not just eyewitness testimonies, which are not scientifically convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:11:01]</a>. He notes that military-grade equipment is designed for battlefield use, not for the precise scientific investigation needed to determine the nature of these objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:21]</a>. While the government may possess high-quality classified data, its classification prevents scientific scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:27]</a>.

The Galileo Project addresses this by aiming to collect open data and analyze it transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:45]</a>. An array of detection devices will be placed on the Harvard College Observatory, combining various sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:58]</a>. Artificial intelligence algorithms will classify detected objects as birds, drones, or "something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:06]</a>. This constant, passive observation is a key difference from government approaches, which often involve anecdotal sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:34]</a>.

Dr. Loeb advocates for modesty in scientific inquiry, likening current attempts to understand UAPs to a "caveman seeing a cellphone" without studying it properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:50]</a>. He believes scientists should help the public and government understand UAPs given the huge implications if they are found to be extraterrestrial equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:31]</a>. He feels that addressing this subject is crucial for humanity in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:33]</a>.

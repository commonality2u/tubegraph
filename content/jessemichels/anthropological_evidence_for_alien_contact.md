Dr. Michael P. Masters, a biological anthropologist and professor at Montana Tech University, has developed a theoretical framework suggesting that "aliens" are in fact humans from the future who have mastered time travel [00:00:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:01:04]</a>. His work, detailed in books such as *Identified Flying Objects: The Extratempestrial Model* and *Revelation: The Future Human Past*, posits that these visitors are returning to visit us [00:00:49]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:01:09]</a>. This perspective offers an explanation for the [[alleged_extraterrestrial_encounters_and_abductions | alleged extraterrestrial encounters and abductions]] and [[extraterrestrial_crafts_and_nonhuman_bodies | nonhuman bodies]] often described.

## Characteristics of Alleged "Aliens"

Masters argues that the common descriptions of "gray aliens" align with potential future human evolution [00:01:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Eyes:** Their eyes are often described as slits, consistent with increased "screen time" in the future [00:01:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Noses and Ears:** They possess very small noses and ears, reflecting a diminished importance of senses like smell and hearing, which are less essential for a species no longer relying on hunter-gathering [00:01:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Child-like Appearance:** The concept of neoteny, where distant descendants resemble their current children, is cited, as gray aliens are consistently described as child-like and about 3 feet tall [00:01:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Historical Support for the Time Travel Hypothesis

Several prominent figures have supported the idea that UFOs and their occupants are related to time travel:
*   **Navy Commander George Hoover:** Admitted that beings from the [[historical_ufo_incidents_and_evidence | Roswell crash]] were "just time traveling humans" [00:01:49]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Herman Oberth:** The father of German rocketry and mentor to Wernher Von Braun, stated that UFOs likely "jump from one time space coordinate to another" rather than traversing vast distances in space [00:01:58]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Steven Spielberg:** May have hinted at time travel in *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, where World War II pilots appear unaged at the end [00:02:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Tom DeLonge:** The frontman of Blink 182 and To The Stars Academy founder, suggested in a Newsweek article that "these things might be coming through time" [00:02:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Paul Hynek (son of J. Allen Hynek):** Posed the questions, "How would they find us and why would they care?" The time travel hypothesis answers: "They would find us 'cause we're their ancestors," and "why would they care about this planet unless they're set to inherit it" [00:02:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Biological Compatibility and Genetic Sampling

The highly human-like characteristics of reported "aliens" suggest a shared lineage [00:00:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:36]</a>:
*   They can breathe our air, have sex with us, and speak our languages [00:00:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   The high probability of evolutionary convergence to look "exactly like us" or "very similar" to us, speak our language, and breathe our air from a completely foreign planet is considered "super unlikely" [00:09:23]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   Alternatively, it's suggested these beings could be [[theories_on_human_alien_genetic_experiments | bioengineered beings]] acting as avatars for an intelligence, designed to be less jarring for human interaction [00:09:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:10:28]</a>. Dr. Masters's book *Revelation: The Future Human Past* explores this idea, suggesting they might be biologically constructed "Droids" utilizing advanced genetic manipulation centuries beyond CRISPR technology [00:10:39]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:11:16]</a>.

A pervasive theme in [[alleged_extraterrestrial_encounters_and_abductions | abduction cases]] is the collection of human genetic material [00:13:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Antonio Vilas Boas (1957):** Described having intercourse with a "future human extraterrestrial being" [00:13:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:14]</a>. The woman he described had physical characteristics compatible with human reproduction [00:15:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Barney Hill:** Reluctantly stated that sperm samples were taken from him [00:13:20]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **Jim Penniston (Rendlesham Forest incident, 1980):** Recalled a contact experience where beings stated they needed genetic samples from "current humans" to "maintain genetic diversity and not get wiped off the planet" due to reproductive problems 8,000 years in the future [00:13:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:46]</a> [00:15:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:17]</a>.

This interest in human gametes is linked to a observed decline in human fertility:
*   Average male sperm count is 59% of what it was in 1973, with testosterone dropping 1% year-over-year since the 1980s [00:12:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   Pesticide exposure is significantly related to men's sperm count [00:12:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   A 60% reduction in sperm counts in males in the last 40 years in the developed world, and a 50% reduction globally, indicate potential future genetic problems [00:14:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:49]</a>.

The concept of human domestication is also relevant, where selection for more pro-social behaviors has occurred over the last 30,000 years, especially since agriculture [00:16:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:30]</a>. This ongoing domestication might be linked to the future beings' interaction with us [00:15:52]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:53]</a>.

## [[historical_religious_contact_experiences_and_modern_ufos | The intersection of ancient myths and modern beliefs about extraterrestrial life]]

The article suggests that [[historical_religious_contact_experiences_and_modern_ufos | ancient myths and modern beliefs about extraterrestrial life]] may converge.
*   Stories of "aliens" to modern humans are likened to how fully clothed, pale-skinned anthropologists speaking a foreign language would appear to the isolated North Sentinelese people, whose contact stories might later become mythology [00:08:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:09:08]</a>. This suggests that "alien contact experiences" may not be interactions with beings from another planet, but rather from "far ahead" in time [00:09:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Intentional Cranial Modification:** The practice of binding heads to achieve cranial deformation, widespread throughout history (e.g., Maya), is explored. When interviewed, one group stated their ancestors were instructed by the "gods" to do this to look "more like them" [00:46:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:56]</a>. The resulting cranial-facial form is very reminiscent of the "gray alien" physiology known in modern [[cultural_implications_of_extraterrestrial_life | cultural knowledge]] [00:47:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:14]</a>.

## The Nature of Intent and Intervention

The intent of these "future human" visitors appears to be a "mixed bag," encompassing benevolence, neutrality, and malevolence, much like humans themselves [00:47:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:48:02]</a>. It's difficult to pin down a singular intent given the vastness of different groups across time [00:48:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:43]</a>.

One significant aspect of their apparent intervention is their interest in human nuclear programs [00:49:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:50]</a>. UFOs are reported to appear more frequently around the creation of nuclear programs, attempting to monitor, shut down, or even activate nuclear facilities [00:49:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:56]</a>. This behavior would "make complete sense in the context of future humans trying to maintain their ideal timeline and maybe even ensure their own existence" [00:49:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:50:03]</a>.

The idea of a "cosmic timeline war" is also introduced, where an advanced future civilization struggles to communicate with human beings, while other forces seek to "mine human consciousness" through distractions and tribalism, leading to a cycle of conflict and exploitation [00:48:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:49:13]</a>.

## Personal Encounters and Consciousness

Dr. Masters shares his own [[alleged_extraterrestrial_encounters_and_abductions | personal experience with future human visitors]], describing an "intervention" where two individuals telepathically communicated with him [00:04:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:06]</a> [00:30:42]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:45]</a>. They seemed to know his private thoughts, indicating a [[neurological_studies_related_to_UFO_encounters | hive mind consciousness]] or ability to access information across time [00:31:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:43]</a> [00:32:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:24]</a>. They informed him they were putting information into his brain for future use, causing a temporary physical and emotional reaction [00:33:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:34:02]</a>. This suggests that these beings are "walking among us" [00:38:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:10]</a>.

Reports of UFO sightings often occur when individuals are in heightened states of consciousness, suggesting a connection to one's "future selves" [00:50:47]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:53]</a>. This is likened to Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel depiction, where God's finger is extended, but Adam's is slightly contracted, implying that "God is always there but the decision is left to man to reach out" [00:50:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:51:05]</a>. This analogy suggests that connecting with our future selves is a choice left to us [00:51:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:10]</a>.

Mario Woods, a former US Air Force Security responder, underwent two hypnotic regression sessions to uncover details about his UFO encounter in 1977 that resulted in [[mario_woodss_alien_abduction_experience | missing time]] and the catatonic state of his partner, Michael Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

## First Regression Session

Mario's first regression session was conducted by Bob Upton, whom he describes as a lead hypnotic regression person from MUFON at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:45">[01:43:45]</a>. Mario was initially skeptical about being hypnotized, believing he was too "strong-willed" and "common-sensed" for it to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:55">[01:36:55]</a>. Despite his house being re-roofed during the session, he noted he "never heard a single air gun going off" during the hypnosis, confirming its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>.

During this session, Mario confronted the memories of what he saw, smelled, and heard, describing it as a "physical" and "real" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>. He recalled feeling "upset" and "painful" when visualizing the incident, particularly an interaction with a "tall one" being where his wrist was "messed with" and hurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>. Throughout the experience, he repeatedly heard a telepathic message: "Do not fear," which traveled through his body like a "vibration" or "hiss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>. He interpreted the intention behind this message as "assuring" and "positive," though he believes the beings "fulfill their mission" regardless, whether it's to obtain DNA or for "some kind of a programming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>.

After the first session, Mario experienced health issues, including his heart being out of rhythm (apib), requiring medication and a blood thinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[01:51:01]</a>. Despite the difficult aspects, he states he does not regret undergoing the regression, as it provided him with "some insight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.

## Second Regression Session

Mario's second regression was conducted by Yvonne Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>. This session further clarified details of the encounter, revealing that Michael Johnson was lying opposite him, with a "small one" (being) positioned between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

Inside the craft, Mario recalled a "beehive" like interior with "multi levels" and many "small Grays" moving around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. He observed that "everything emanated power" but noted no humming sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>. He believed the "tall gray" was "in charge" of the smaller Grays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:19">[01:32:19]</a>. Instead of lying on a table, Mario was "wrapped in a triangular kind of beam" about four feet in the air, which felt like a "force field" that could move him around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:35">[01:32:35]</a>. When his arm was lifted, it "exited that pyramidal field" and was in the being's "atmosphere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.

He was also shown a "museum" or "antique shop" like room containing various old items such as a sewing machine, 1950s lamps, a cabinet TV, a wooden box radio, and a steam iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. In this room, he noticed a round window "with a slice taken out of it like a pie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. He was told he could look out, but was "too afraid" to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:20">[01:35:20]</a>. He then followed a "small gray" into a "fogged" room where the wrist procedure occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:13">[01:36:13]</a>.

## Post-Regression Effects and Speculations

Following his initial experience and subsequent regressions, Mario developed a profound and unexplained interest in archaeology, pyramids, and ancient advanced mathematics, feeling as if this knowledge was "installed inside" or "downloaded" into him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>. He aligns with theories by Christopher Dunn and Robert Schoch, believing pyramids were "power generators" that distributed energy worldwide during a time that has been "completely blacked out" from human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>.

Mario also experienced ongoing "strange things," including emails vanishing and an incident in 2017 where his house lights flickered, alarms sounded, and the power grid was affected, with a neighbor reporting his backyard was "lit up like a Hollywood set" at 4 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a>.

The medical examination after his 1977 incident revealed two burn marks on his body: one above his right eye and one on the back of his right hand, where skin samples were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. A doctor noted that the marks were of the "same depth and the same size" with a "little dimple" in the middle, and could not associate them with any known life-saving event or accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:23">[01:41:23]</a>. He speculates these marks are linked to his encounter, though he doesn't recall them happening during the "missing time" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>.

The flight surgeon's initial focus on examining his gums and teeth is theorized to be connected to research from individuals like Andre Puharich, who was involved in the [[MK Ultra mind control program]] and believed that fine metals in teeth could interact with extremely low frequency radio waves responsible for thought and telepathic communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:10">[02:05:10]</a>. This suggests the medical check might have been to see if Mario was already "receiving downloads" or as a potential site for a future "implant" for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>.

Mario believes the beings are "Grays," including a "tall gray" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>. He doesn't think they are humans from the future, suggesting they might be from "another dimension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>. He speculates they could be involved in "hybridizing themselves with us" potentially due to their own planetary conditions or "progression through space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:13">[02:00:13]</a>.

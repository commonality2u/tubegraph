The argument that life is uncommon often lacks supporting [[evidence_against_the_unlikelihood_of_life | evidence against the unlikelihood of life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In fact, evidence suggests the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Early Emergence of Life

Fossilized blue-green algae found in stromatolites date back 3.5 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Recent scholarship indicates that life may have evolved even earlier, approximately 4.1 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Considering the Earth is roughly 5 billion years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> and its crust had not even cooled by 4.1 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, this provides [[possibility_of_life_at_early_stages_of_earths_history | evidence that life evolved on Earth at the earliest possible time]], even earlier than one might reasonably suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Resilience of Microbes

It has been determined that [[microbial_life_in_outer_space | microbes can live in outer space]] and remain viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Furthermore, microbes that were in stasis within two-billion-year-old terrestrial rock have recently been identified and successfully brought back to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Implications

All available evidence suggests that life is either evolving very quickly, or there is some form of [[panspermia_theory | panspermia theory]] in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

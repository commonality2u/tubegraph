In 1977, Mario Woods, a former US Air Force Security Police responder, experienced a profound [[ufo_and_uap_phenomena_witnessed_by_military_personnel | UFO/UAP phenomena witnessed by military personnel]] incident at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This encounter left him with missing time and physical marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, and his partner in a catatonic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Mario Woods' Background
Mario Woods, 69 years old and residing in Southeast Georgia, served in the Air Force from 1975 to 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. In 1977, he was stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:53">[01:54:53]</a>, where he worked as Security Police assigned to the missile squadron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">[02:00:09]</a>. His role involved acting as a response team for alarms and facility checks on a 12-hour shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:31">[02:28:31]</a>.

Woods was part of the Personal Reliability Program (PRP) for sensitive nuclear equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This program required deep analysis to ensure personnel could react appropriately, even to the point of taking a life to preserve nuclear assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Random blood tests and urinalysis were standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. He had no prior mental health history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## The 1977 Incident: Initial Sighting
On November 18, 1977, around 9:00-9:15 p.m., while outside for a cigarette in cold weather, Woods observed a light in the east at a 30-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. He initially thought it was the landing lights of B-52 bombers flying low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. The light, appearing like a "mini moon," did not change its position and made no noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

Intrigued, Woods went inside their facility and, with a wave-off from Staff Sergeant Bill Hollman, used the facility's lights to flash at the object three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. After about a minute and a half, the object flashed back in sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Woods interpreted this as an acknowledgement, similar to a wing wave from an aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

He then called his partner, Michael Johnson, to witness the phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Johnson, who outranked Woods by two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>, was less impressed but confirmed seeing the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. Woods repeated the signaling, and the object responded, though it later moved further west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. The object then disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. This initial interaction lasted about 40 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

## The 1977 Incident: November 5 Missile Site
Around 12:05 a.m., an alert phone rang, indicating a two-pronged alarm at November 5 missile site, a Minute Man 2 missile facility located north of Nulle, South Dakota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. The alarm indicated both above-ground and below-ground sensors were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. Woods and Johnson, in their F-150 pickup truck, prepared for the response, which involved a 15-minute travel time to the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.

During their journey, Woods observed a pulsating orange, yellow, and white glow coming from the ground in the direction of November 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. As they approached the site, turning onto a dogleg road, they saw a massive spherical object, about 10 feet in the air, directly on top of the missile's blast door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. The object was described as being the size of a Walmart building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. It had a moving energy source around it, like boiling plasma, with no discernible tail sections, port holes, thrusters, or wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.

## The Encounter's Immediate Aftermath
Upon pulling their truck within 60 feet of the object, a blinding light, described as being like a welder's arc, emanated from the sphere, almost blowing out Woods' eyeballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. Immediately after, the atmosphere seemed to vacate, making it impossible to breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. Woods, in excellent physical condition, felt completely overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

He prayed for relief and, in desperation, rolled down his window, climbed onto the window sill, and flashed his flashlight at the object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>. After doing so, he felt relief and slid back into his seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>. The truck's cab became illuminated with shimmering dust particles moving in slow motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. Michael Johnson remained frozen, bathed in a blue-white light, gripping the steering wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>. Woods felt trapped in light, as if someone had him "right where they wanted me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:00">[26:39:00]</a>.

A black sphere, six times the size of a beach ball with long, vent-like lines, then shot down in front of their truck, bouncing around the vehicle before disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:09]</a>. Woods then secured his M16 rifle between his legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>. A pervasive, overwhelming ammonia-like stench filled the vehicle, seemingly through the ventilation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18:00">[28:18:00]</a>.

Woods began to experience tunnel vision and felt as though he would pass out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>. As he blacked out, he saw four "beings" gliding beside the truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. Three were of similar size, wearing uniforms, one with a small wand with a yellow tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:22:00">[31:22:00]</a>. The fourth, taller than the others, had a pulsating device on its chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. Woods felt intense fear before completely blacking out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>.

## Missing Time and Displacement
Woods regained consciousness moments later, his weapon still clutched between his legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>. The light from the object was gone, and total darkness surrounded them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. Michael Johnson remained unresponsive, in a catatonic state, glued to the steering wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>.

Woods stepped out of the truck and found himself in mud, next to a white wall 50 feet high at a 45-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>. He realized they were at the backside of the New Lake Reservoir Dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>. This location was 8 to 8.5 miles away from the November 5 site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:00">[36:54:00]</a>, a distance they could not have covered in their two-wheel-drive vehicle without leaving tracks in the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>.

Woods then heard a radio call from Wing Security Control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:00">[35:33:00]</a>. He reported his disorientation and Johnson's catatonic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>. It was getting light, and he realized it was after 6:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:00">[38:03:00]</a>, indicating a loss of approximately six hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:14:00">[38:14:00]</a>. Three alert teams, along with two Deputy officers from Sturgis and one state trooper, were searching for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>.

## Post-Incident Debriefing and Secrecy
Upon their return to November 1 control, Woods and Johnson were immediately separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>. Johnson was taken to a back room, still in his catatonic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:46:00">[43:46:00]</a>. Woods was taken to the day room and subjected to intense questioning about the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:48:00">[44:48:00]</a>. He noted that the questions implied prior [[historical_ufo_incidents_and_evidence | historical_UFO incidents and evidence]] on base, such as rumors of two security policemen found disoriented and unclothed near the Badlands years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:00">[45:31:00]</a>, and F-86 jets chasing objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:14:00">[46:14:00]</a>.

After his debriefing, Woods was sent to the flight surgeon's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:57:00">[58:57:00]</a>. He strategically omitted mentioning the "beings" he saw to avoid losing his clearance and job, as he was a newlywed needing employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:17:00">[59:17:00]</a>.

In the flight surgeon's office, two doctors and a nurse examined him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>. OSI agents were on the other side of a partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. The doctors bizarrely checked his gums and teeth, then noted "burns" above his right eye and on the back of his right hand, taking skin samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

Back in Colonel Spraker's office, Woods was ordered to write a formal report of the entire incident, omitting the beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. He was then presented with a non-disclosure agreement, classifying the incident and prohibiting him from speaking to media or even his wife about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>.

The debriefing involved Rick Dodie, an Air Force counterintelligence agent, who was later known for performing a psychological operation on a researcher who had seen an exotic craft at Kirtland Air Force Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. Dodie's stated purpose at Ellsworth was to pick up medical records for Woods and Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>, which Woods found suspicious given the nature of the incident and the missing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>.

## Physical After-Effects and Hypnotic Regression
Woods' burns healed quickly without leaving marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. He also has two dimpled pock marks on his body, which a doctor confirmed were not from any known life-saving event or injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a>.

Three weeks after the incident, Michael Johnson appeared at Woods' apartment, seemingly back to normal, though reserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. They compared their experiences, and Johnson confirmed seeing the craft, the black sphere, smelling the stench, and feeling everything, but being unable to move or speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>. They both drew nearly identical pictures of the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. This was the last time Woods saw Michael Johnson, who has since been untraceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.

Years later, Woods underwent two hypnotic regressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>
> In the first regression, conducted by Bob Upton, Woods recalled being inside the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>. He saw multiple levels with small "Grays" moving around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. He was held in a "triangular kind of beam" or "force field" about four feet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>. A tall Gray entity performed a painful procedure on his wrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. Telepathic words, "do not fear," vibrated through his body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>. The encounter was painful and terrifying, causing him to feel as though he was "leaving his body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>
> The second regression with Yvonne Smith revealed Michael Johnson was also present, lying opposite to Woods with a small Gray between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>.

Woods also remembered being taken to a "museum-like" room within the craft, filled with old Earth artifacts like a Singer sewing machine, 1950s lamps, and an antique wooden radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. There was a round window with a slice taken out, which he was invited to look out of but was too afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>.

The experience caused Woods to develop Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), which he attributes to the stress and trauma of the hypnotic regression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[01:51:01]</a>.

## Continued Phenomena and Broader Implications
After the 1977 incident, Woods developed an intense interest in archaeology and pyramids, feeling as though knowledge had been "installed" or "downloaded" into him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>. He believes pyramids were ancient power generators with global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, aligning with theories by Christopher Dunn and Robert Schoch about advanced ancient technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>. The beings he encountered resemble "Grays," specifically "small Grays" and a "tall Gray" similar to depictions in Whitley Strieber's *Communion* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>. He speculates they are not future humans but possibly from another dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>.

In 2017, Woods experienced a power outage and strange phenomena at his home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:33">[01:52:33]</a>. At 4:11 a.m., he found himself sleepwalking, witnessing a 4.5 to 5-foot diameter hole in his north bedroom wall that vanished with sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. All the lights in his house flickered, and low-voltage alarms on appliances went off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:11">[01:54:11]</a>. Georgia Power later informed him that only his house was affected, and it had "lit up their board downtown like the Fourth of July" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:58">[01:56:58]</a>. A neighbor also reported seeing Woods' backyard "lit up like a Hollywood set" at 4:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:40">[01:58:40]</a>.

Woods' family also has a history of sightings; his mother saw three "flying saucers" in Port Arthur, Texas, in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:43">[02:15:43]</a>, and his father, a merchant seaman, witnessed [[Military involvement with UFO phenomena | USOs (Unidentified Submerged Objects)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Broader Context and Legacy
Woods believes there is a significant cover-up regarding [[ufo_sightings_and_government_secrecy | UFO sightings and government secrecy]] at nuclear sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. He speculates that if an object could shut off one missile, it would know the shortest response time for security personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. He feels the human response to these incidents is "oddly routine," suggesting such events are not singular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.

He estimates that perhaps one out of every four security policemen at Ellsworth Air Force Base likely saw something in the night sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>, due to rotating shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:28">[01:20:28]</a>. The fact that many are told to sign non-disclosure agreements implies a much larger number of witnesses than officially acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

Woods' experience resonates with other [[experiences and testimonials of military personnel witnessing UFO activities | military personnel witnessing UFO activities]], such as Terry Lovelace, whose partner also suffered a severe, lasting impact from an encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:43">[02:01:43]</a>.

Woods hopes his testimony contributes to understanding and reducing fear around the UFO phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:47">[01:59:47]</a>. He believes these beings have positive intentions and fulfill a mission, whether it's obtaining DNA or some form of programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a>. He is open to testifying before Congress to share his "up close and personal" account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

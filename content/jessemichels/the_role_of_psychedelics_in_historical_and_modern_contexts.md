Psychedelics are viewed as substances that can offer access to different states of consciousness and potentially influence human evolution and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. They provide a direct, unmediated experience of the divine, unlike traditional religious institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

## Historical and Ancient Influence

### Ancient Cultures and Rituals
Graham Hancock's 2005 book, *Supernatural* (reissued as *Visionary*), explores the historical use of psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Brian Muraresku's book, *The Immortality Key*, further elaborates on the concept of human amnesia and [[influence_of_hallucinogens_in_ancient_cultures | hallucinogen use in ancient cultures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

The Eleusinian Mysteries, held 13 miles northwest of Athens, were a setting for deep psychedelic journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Initiates, including figures like Plato and Socrates, consumed a drink called "kykeon" and underwent extraordinary, life-changing experiences, often losing their fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. This directly relates to [[ritualized_psychedelic_trips_in_western_civilization | ritualized psychedelic trips in Western civilization]].

### Psychedelics and Early Christianity
Brian Muraresku also presents evidence that early Christianity was a psychedelic religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. The idea that Christ's Last Supper was a pagan mystery ritual is not new; Martin Luther King Jr. wrote an essay on the influence of mystery religions on Christianity, positing the "Pagan continuity hypothesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. Dennis McDonald, a theology professor, suggests that the "eating flesh and drinking blood" imagery points to Dionysian cults, where consuming the god's flesh and blood granted immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. Passages like John 6:53, "unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you," resonate with these ancient mystery rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

Early Christianity viewed Christ more as a teacher, and it was primarily after the emergence of the Roman Catholic Church and the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD that it began to oppress Christian sects using psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. This council arbitrarily cut down Christianity into an accepted canon, discounting books like the Gospel of Thomas that emphasized an individual's ability to ascend to a more divine state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. This highlights the [[history_and_marginalization_of_psychedelics | history and marginalization of psychedelics]] by institutional powers.

### Influence on Evolution and Consciousness
Terence McKenna, in his book *Food of the Gods*, suggested that a "quantum leap" in human behavior and consciousness was a result of experimenting with psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. He believed certain naturally growing drugs were put on Earth to facilitate human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. McKenna also spoke of a mushroom trip where the mushrooms revealed blueprints for hyper-light drives within their memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

One theory suggests that the consumption of ergot, which grows naturally on wheat, barley, and rye, might have spurred the ideas that led to modern civilization during the Agricultural Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. While some ergot types are toxic, the one on barley is not and is water-soluble, making it consumable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

## Modern Perspectives and Potential

### Contrast with Alcohol and Mental Health
Society often values an "alert problem-solving state of consciousness," and legal drugs like alcohol, which provide a "holiday" from this state without prompting profound questions, are embraced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. However, psychedelics offer access to entirely different states of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

Psychedelics can break "blocked and narrow ways of thinking," which are characteristic of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Traditional pharmaceutical drugs like Seroxat and Prozac are described as useless for treating depression, with scientific studies suggesting placebos are just as effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This aligns with recent findings that show no correlation between serotonin deficiency and depression, indicating society has been "sold a myth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. Psychedelics, conversely, offer "another lens that allows us to see a wider reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. This relates to [[psychedelics_and_mental_health_treatment | psychedelics and mental health treatment]].

### Personal Experiences and Shamanism
Graham Hancock recounts his own creative gift from psychedelics: in 2006, during five Ayahuasca sessions in Brazil, he was given the entire plot of a novel, *Entangled*, and a strong instruction to write it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. He emphasizes that shamans should be taken seriously when they describe plants and fungi as "teachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. These "teachings" often relate to one's own life and behavior, prompting self-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

Hancock also describes an atypical alien encounter during an Ayahuasca journey, where he saw flying saucers and an alien face, receiving a message that "they were going to take me away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. He later regretted opening his eyes, as he believes he should have embraced the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.

### DMT Research and Phenomenology
A significant project at Imperial College London, led by Christopher Timmerman, is trialing psychedelics with human volunteers not for therapeutic benefit, but to understand their phenomenology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. DMT is particularly effective at inducing entity encounters, famously described as Terence McKenna's "machine elves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. The Imperial College research can keep people in the DMT state for an hour (normally 10-15 minutes) using intravenous methods, allowing for more processing and interviewing while in MRI scanners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. Volunteers consistently report encountering the same entities in the same settings, suggesting a real, not just hallucinatory, experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>.

### DMT and Consciousness
DMT exists in all organic material and is produced endogenously by the human brain at significant times, such as during fetal identity formation, REM sleep, and near-death experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. The widespread presence of DMT receptors in the brain suggests its vital importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. Psilocybin is also closely related to DMT, belonging to the tryptamine family of compounds that induce extraordinary experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.

This reinforces the idea that [[consciousness_psychedelics_and_their_connection_to_historical_insights | consciousness psychedelics and their connection to historical insights]] is fundamental to the universe, not merely a byproduct of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>. Physical bodies may act as a "filter" or "reducing valve" on a default state of greater knowledge and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. Mystery rituals, through the use of psychedelics, may temporarily kill this "collapsing function," allowing individuals to "glitch into this greater knowledge" and a wider reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

Graham Hancock does not believe that consciousness requires physical bodies, but rather manifests through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. While the "alert problem-solving state of consciousness" is useful for certain functions (e.g., flying a plane), it is not the only state, nor is it "all we are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>.

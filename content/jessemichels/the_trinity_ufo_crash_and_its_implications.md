The world of [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFOs]] can be challenging to navigate, with many sources spreading disinformation or engaged in psychological operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Amidst this complexity, long-time researchers on a genuine quest for meaning occasionally emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. One such figure is Jacques Vallee, a serious researcher with backgrounds in computer science, physics, and astronomy, who even helped build the earliest version of the internet (ARPANET) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Vallee is known for having spoken to more [[Historical UFO Incidents and Evidence | UFO]] witnesses and seen more exotic material than almost any living person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. His books are dense and detailed, often revealing profound insights not found elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Steven Spielberg even based the character played by François Truffaut in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" on Vallee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Vallee's work delves into the mystical as much as the scientific, exploring esotericism, parapsychology, and the material science of [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. His recent book, "Trinity: The Best Kept Secret," investigates a [[UFO crash retrieval | UFO crash]] that occurred in 1945, near the Trinity test site in New Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## The Trinity Incident (1945)

Just 20 days after the first-ever atomic bomb test in the United States and two days after Japan's concession, a metallic, avocado-shaped object fell from the sky in San Antonio, New Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The object was damaged, with one panel missing, but largely retained its integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Two young boys, Remy Baca (7) and Jose Padilla (9), sons of local cattle ranchers, witnessed the craft and through the opening, observed three human-like creatures, about three feet tall, with two eyes, two arms, three fingers, and two legs, moving by sliding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Jose Padilla even went inside the object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Profound Implications on Ufology

The Trinity story, detailed by Vallee and co-authored by Paola Harris, has several unique and profound implications for ufology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Predates "Flying Saucer" Terminology
The incident occurred before the term "flying saucer" was introduced into the public lexicon in 1947 by Kenneth Arnold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This suggests that the [[Historical UFO Incidents and Evidence | UFO]] phenomenon in the American context likely precedes the more famous Roswell incident (also 1947) and that "flying saucers" are merely a modern interpretation of a phenomenon that has existed for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Vallee frequently emphasizes that people have always reported seeing "aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Extreme Compartmentalization of Information
When Vallee began researching the Trinity case, no one with top-secret clearances in the U.S. federal government had heard of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. He was introduced to it by an Italian [[Historical UFO Incidents and Evidence | UFO]] researcher, Paola Harris, who had already interviewed the witnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This suggests that the group holding [[Strategic dynamics surrounding UFO disclosure and government involvement | UFO secrets]] is small and insular, with their own separate clearance systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Even officials with clearances "Above Top Secret" were unaware of such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

This theory is supported by anecdotes like Chris Mellon's near-meeting with someone involved in a [[UFO crash retrieval | UFO program]] within an aerospace company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Further evidence comes from the alleged Wilson Memo, a leaked document describing a secret meeting where Admiral Thomas Wilson encountered a black-budget private aerospace corporation attempting to [[UFO reverse engineering and crash retrievals | reverse engineer crashed UFOs]] without official government oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The "gatekeepers" of this program believed the material was not of this Earth but had little success with [[UFO reverse engineering and crash retrievals | reverse engineering]] since Roswell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The system was designed with intense compartmentalization, meaning no one, except those at the very top, possessed the full picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### The Absurd and Intermittent Reinforcement
Vallee describes the Trinity incident as an example of the "inherently absurd nature of [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFOs]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. He suggests that the strange, almost "tongue-in-cheek" way events unfold might be a form of intermittent reinforcement, similar to B.F. Skinner's psychological experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Consistent rewards lead to fast but impermanent learning, whereas intermittent reinforcement creates a stronger, more lasting behavioral change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This raises the question of whether human evolution or historical narratives are being co-directed by a superior species through such sporadic control mechanisms, possibly manifesting as religious figures or phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Landing a [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFO]] on the White House lawn might create only temporary amazement before being dismissed as a trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

### A Show of Force and Deterrence
The appearance of the avocado-shaped craft so close to the Trinity atomic bomb test, according to Vallee, could be interpreted as a "show of force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. It might have been a communication stating, "You think you're really smart because you blew up a weapon down the road here... no, no, look at this," demonstrating a stepwise superior propulsion technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

### Higher Dimensions and Perception of Reality
The account of the Trinity craft appearing smaller from the outside than its interior, and a similar San Jose case where a woman described a [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFO]] as larger inside than her house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, leads Vallee to discuss the concept of higher dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This phenomenon can be understood through Edwin Abbott's "Flatland," where a 3D object intersecting a 2D plane would only show a "sliver" or disc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Similarly, a hypercube (a 4D object) intersecting our 3D plane would appear smaller externally than its true internal size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Carl Sagan explains this with the shadow of a tesseract (a 4D hypercube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. This suggests that [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFOs]] might be manifestations of objects existing beyond our typical three spatial dimensions, creating the illusion of space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

### Human Perception and the Phenomenon
Some individuals, like Chris Bledsoe or the "biological sensors of [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFOs]]" described by Jeffrey Mishlov, seem to perceive these phenomena more readily than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. This raises the question of whether we are "swimming in these things" but lack the capacity to perceive them in our normal reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Dr. J. Allen Hynek was reportedly bothered by "repeaters" — people who consistently saw [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. The phenomenon can also "play with your life," sometimes leading to positive "religious conversion" experiences, and other times to "demonic tricksters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Witnesses often feel bothered by strange occurrences in their homes, including things that cause trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

### Interdimensional Beings and Historical Narratives
In his 1969 book "Passport to Magonia," Vallee moved away from the extraterrestrial hypothesis, proposing that [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFOs]] are interdimensional beings that have interacted with humanity for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. He posits that these entities may have used tactics like intermittent reinforcement, confusion, deception, and absurdity to shape human historical narratives for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This suggests that Celtic leprechauns, biblical angels and demons, and modern "space aliens" might all be the same phenomenon, interpreted through the "noble mythology" of their respective times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The example of Betty and Barney Hill recalling aliens from "Outer Limits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, or the biblical wheels of Ezekiel being [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>, illustrates how media or cultural context might mediate and interpret incomprehensible mystical experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

### [[Impact of UFOs on Religion and Society | UFOs]] and Religion
Vallee has a long-standing interest in esotericism, particularly Rosicrucianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. He named his group of [[Historical UFO Incidents and Evidence | UFO]] researchers "The Invisible College," referencing Robert Boyle's 17th-century group influenced by Rosicrucian ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. Vallee believes that [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFO]] research has the potential to heal the divide between science and spirit, a schism created by the Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. If [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFOs]] and aliens are real, past religious conversions might be reinterpreted as alien abductions, and biblical events could be seen as [[UFO sightings and nuclear connection | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. This turns a scientific inquiry into a metaphysical quest for larger meaning, with vast implications for humanity's teleology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

However, Vallee cautions against the formation of new [[UFOs Religious Interpretations | UFO religions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. While a scientific approach seeks equations for observable phenomena, there's another level of experience, like observing the galaxy, that evokes wonder and fusion with the universe rather than equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. This profound experience can also elicit terror, leading people to avoid looking at the night sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

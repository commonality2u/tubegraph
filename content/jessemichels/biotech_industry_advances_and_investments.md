Christian Angermayer, an entrepreneur, [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_investing_in_deep_and_frontier_tech | investor]], and head of Apeiron, which manages $3.5 billion in assets, is a prominent figure in the biotech sector [00:00:14]. Known for his early investment in Compass Pathways and founding Atai Life Sciences, Angermayer is focused on demarginalizing psychedelics and other advanced technologies [00:00:23]. He views biotech as a unique blend of charity and profitability, stating that every success in the field improves lives by curing problems [00:14:02].

## Psychedelics in Medicine

Angermayer's journey into psychedelics began with a personal experience with magic mushrooms, which he described as the "single most meaningful thing" he had ever done [00:02:05]. This experience, combined with insights from a neuroscientist, led him to believe in their medical potential [00:02:22].

His approach to psychedelics is strictly medical, not recreational [00:03:09]. He believes they should not be broadly given out or easily accessible for recreational use [00:03:11].

### Compass Pathways

Compass Pathways is a company focused on psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms [00:03:44]. Its primary target indication is treatment-resistant depression [00:03:48]. Angermayer expressed surprise at the openness of regulators, politicians, and the establishment to this research, attributing it to the legitimacy of the science and the scale of the global mental health crisis [00:03:53]. Conditions like depression, anxiety, addiction, and PTSD affect hundreds of millions of people, creating significant pressure for solutions [00:04:10].

### Atai Life Sciences

Recognizing the potential of a wider range of psychedelics beyond psilocybin—such as ketamine, LSD, MDMA, and DMT—Angermayer founded Atai Life Sciences [00:04:34]. Atai was created to capture and develop various natural and artificial psychedelics that make commercial sense, serving as a broader platform while Compass remained focused on psilocybin [00:04:47].

### Historical Marginalization of Psychedelics

The marginalization of psychedelics in the late 1960s is attributed to several factors:
*   **Association with Counterculture:** They became linked with the Vietnam War counterculture and the hippie movement [00:05:30].
*   **Misdiagnosis of Mental Health:** Mental health issues were a marginalized disease, and proper diagnosis was difficult [00:06:10].
*   **Lack of Scientific Explanation:** While known to work, the scientific mechanisms of psychedelics in the brain were not as explainable as they are today [00:06:25].
*   **Political Agenda:** Governments, at the time, leveraged the association of these drugs with anti-war movements to discredit dissenters [00:06:37].

Historically, psychedelics have been used for thousands of years, with figures like Plato and Aristotle engaging in experiences that led to spiritual revelations [00:07:03]. Brian Murarescu's book, *The Immortality Key*, explores this ancient use [00:06:57]. Psilocybin, for example, can reduce the fear of death in terminally ill patients [00:07:25]. Angermayer notes that psychedelic experiences often have a spiritual component, providing a sense of proof for ancient religious founders who might have used similar substances [00:07:57].

### Mental Health Crisis: A Macro Outlook

Angermayer attributes the rise in loneliness and depression to three eroding pillars of human well-being [00:08:30]:
*   **Fear of Death:** People are "permanently terrified of dying," both themselves and their loved ones, which weakens the brain [00:08:39]. Religion and faith traditionally serve as a counterbalance to this fear [00:09:01].
*   **Lack of Purpose:** Technological innovation is expected to eliminate 70-80% of jobs in the next 10-20 years, leading to a sense of "futurephobia"—a fear of the future and loss of purpose [00:09:37].
*   **Eroding Communities:** The dissolution of traditional community structures contributes to a lack of connection [00:10:17].

Loneliness, a word that emerged during the Victorian Industrial Revolution, leads to severe health issues, with lonely individuals dying significantly earlier [00:10:35]. Angermayer proposes that people in nursing homes could benefit from medical-assisted psychedelic trips once or twice a year to combat loneliness and its effects [00:11:11].

## Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)

Angermayer has made a significant [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_investing_in_deep_and_frontier_tech | investment]] in Blackrock Neurotech, which he identifies as the leading brain-computer interface company globally [00:11:22]. Out of 30 people worldwide with functioning BCIs, 28 are running on Blackrock's interface [00:11:46].

These interfaces currently help quadriplegic individuals or those with severe disabilities like ALS to overcome their challenges [00:12:01]. BCI technology allows for both output (commands, controls) and input (sensory information back to the brain) [00:12:35]. An example is a patient with an electronic arm who can feel sensations as if it were their own arm, demonstrated by shaking hands with Obama [00:12:14].

Future applications could extend to the gaming industry, allowing players to feel sensations within virtual realities [00:12:44]. However, the technology raises significant [[emerging_technologies_and_their_ethical_implications | ethical implications]], including concerns about "wrong memories" or the brain being hacked, which could blur the line of what is real [00:12:57]. Angermayer emphasizes the importance of establishing an ethics committee to guide development responsibly [00:13:20].

## Other Biotech Advances

Angermayer is bullish on biotech, advocating for investments that make people healthier and enable them to live longer [00:13:31]. He believes we have focused too long on curing cancer and not enough on preventing it through vaccines [00:14:31].

One such company, Sensei, is in phase two trials for a cancer vaccine [00:14:42]. This vaccine aims to make the immune system aware of cancer cells, allowing it to fight them off. If side effects are minimal, the vaccine could be taken early to prevent cancer from developing [00:15:09]. This aligns with his broader interest in [[advancements_in_longevity_research_and_antiaging_interventions | longevity]] and living a long, healthy life [00:14:14].

## Investment Philosophy

Angermayer largely trusts his intuition in [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_investing_in_deep_and_frontier_tech | investment]] decisions, viewing it as a powerful combination of data points and pattern recognition [00:15:28]. He believes that when he has gone against his intuition, it has generally led to negative outcomes [00:15:37].

He also supports the idea of governments printing money and directing it towards R&D and tech, arguing that while governments are poor allocators of money, this strategy pushes funds into risky, visionary asset classes that might not otherwise receive funding [00:16:32]. He contends that even a 16-year-old Robinhood trader might be a better allocator of money on average than the government [00:18:04].

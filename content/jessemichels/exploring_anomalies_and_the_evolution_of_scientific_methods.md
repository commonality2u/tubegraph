The study of anomalies is crucial for advancing scientific understanding, especially when current paradigms fall short. As Deep Prasad suggests, we must be comfortable with the idea that "when we study the abyss, it studies us back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) as Anomalies

Deep Prasad, a 26-year-old with a quantum computing startup called Quantum Generative Materials, is focused on [[technological_revolutions_and_scientific_exploration_of_ufos | reverse engineering UAPs]] using quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He believes there are "too many [[random_event_generators_and_anomalies | anomalies]] around the world for us to ignore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The Pentagon has documented hundreds of instances of optical, radar, and infrared detections of UAPs, which exhibit five consistent observable properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. These include:
*   Sudden and instantaneous acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Hypersonic velocity with no signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

These properties, as described by Eric Weinstein, "exhibit wholly new physics, not just new engineering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, a Tic-Tac UAP was estimated to reach at least 31 times the speed of sound without disturbing the air around it, indicating physics beyond typical macroscopic interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. If UAP visitation is taken seriously, it suggests that Einstein's theories are not the "last word" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Prasad thinks these observables point to UAPs engaging in quantum macroscopic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Quantum Macroscopic Behavior
Quantum physics usually describes the very small (atoms, photons, electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Prasad postulates that UAPs could be large, macroscopic quantum objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This means they might be composed of advanced materials whose emergent properties cannot be modeled by current physics and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Evolution of the Scientific Method

The modern scientific method, attributed to Sir Francis Bacon, assumes that whatever is derived about the universe should be repeatable, testable, and controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This assumption implies a static universe where measurements are unaffected by external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

However, the existence of phenomena like the Tic-Tac UAP, which is non-repeatable, challenges this fundamental assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Prasad argues that the scientific method needs modification to account for such [[random_event_generators_and_anomalies | anomalies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

### Anomalies as Harbingers of New Paradigms
Just as Black Body Radiation in the 1860s was an anomaly that led to Max Planck's discovery of quantized light and the birth of quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, current anomalies could signal the need for a new scientific paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Studying [[random_event_generators_and_anomalies | anomalies]] is incredibly important because they can be "a harbinger of the next paradigm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, rather than being dismissed to maintain the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

The universe is not static; there is a non-zero chance that a "crazy [[random_event_generators_and_anomalies | anomaly]] that has never been properly characterized will occur" in an experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. We need to be able to quantify and account for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## Quantum Computing and Materials Science

Prasad's startup aims to simulate new materials and predict their properties before they are made in a lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The goal is to solve the Schrodinger's many-body equation, which can describe everything about a material but has been computationally impossible for more than three atoms on classical computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Quantum computing can overcome this bottleneck by leveraging quantum effects directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Quantum computers use "qubits" which can exist in superpositions of states, allowing them to encode vastly more information than classical bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. For example, describing 97 entangled electrons in a caffeine molecule would require more classical bits than there are atoms on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Nature's ability to "bookkeep" quantum states is computationally impossible for us today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Biological Quantum Sensing

All physical materials, including the human brain and skin, are quantum systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. While the brain's quantum sensing capabilities are unclear, there's evidence for biological quantum effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. For instance, robins use a protein called cryptochrome (Cry4) in their eyes to sense the Earth's magnetic field, enabling them to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

Lockheed successfully replicated this biological quantum sensing by creating the Dark Ice Magnetometer six years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. These magnetometers allow navigation anywhere on Earth with GPS precision without needing satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, a technology potentially useful for extraterrestrial species visiting new planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. More powerful quantum sensors in the future could provide atomic resolution insights into the human body, leading to medical advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Implications of Anomalies

### The Interactive Universe
The idea of an "interactive universe" suggests that anomalies are not mere errors but inherent parts of a dynamic reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. The universe is not static; something anomalous that has never been characterized could occur at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### UAPs and Cellular Automata
Prasad proposes a "lunatic" theory for why certain people see UAPs: it's part of a "cellular automata" game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. In this theory, individual UAP sightings, while seemingly one-offs, contribute to a highly complex, emergent phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Humanity could be part of a larger, more intelligent organism's "cellular automata game" designed to push society towards a new, more complex state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. This aligns with observations of synchronous discoveries across disparate cultures and esoteric traditions of cyclical civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, suggesting that technology and progress might be more preordained or "zapped into us" (as in William James's transmission theory of consciousness) than we think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

### Future of UAP Research
Prasad predicts that within the next decade, enough scientific evidence will be collected, through collaboration between scientific and "post-scientific" groups, to acknowledge that "we are not the only life forms that are intelligent and super intelligent on this planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. This shift could integrate scientific understanding with "magical" or religious interpretations of reality, where phenomena like angels or visions might be reinterpreted as encounters with extraterrestrial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

He emphasizes that ignoring the growing number of [[random_event_generators_and_anomalies | anomalies]] is "painfully naive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Given that current physics (quantum mechanics and general relativity) describes only 5% of the universe, it's misguided to be so confident in our current worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. People often "mistake the map for the territory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. This points to the need for a more open and evolving scientific method that can accommodate the unexplained.

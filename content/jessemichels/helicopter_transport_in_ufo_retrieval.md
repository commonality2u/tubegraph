During a specific incident involving a non-human craft, a helicopter pilot was tasked with transporting a recovered object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The object was described as an "egg" and was considered extraordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This event highlights aspects of [[ufo_crash_retrieval | UFO crash retrieval]] and potential [[transportation_of_ufo_technology_to_the_us | transportation of UFO technology]].

## Description of the Retrieved Object

The object, referred to as "the egg," was estimated to be approximately 20 feet longitudinally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The pilot confirmed seeing the object clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Helicopter Operation Details

The helicopter's role was to transport the "egg" using a long line, measuring 150 feet, which hung below the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This line was equipped with a remote hook for securing the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The operation occurred at night, with sufficient lunar illumination for the pilot to see the object with the naked eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Ground Team Actions

A ground team was present at the retrieval site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Their task involved wrapping nets around the object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Members of this team physically touched the craft during this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

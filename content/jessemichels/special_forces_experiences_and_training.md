## Randy Anderson: Special Forces Experiences and Unconventional Technology Encounters

Randy Anderson is a Green Beret and an 18 Bravo Special Forces weapon Sergeant, highly proficient in operating nearly every firearm imaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>. He has completed the notorious SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape) and Q Special Forces qualification courses, both known for their very high failure rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Randy, a physical specimen, typically maintains a humble and quiet Green Beret attitude, which makes his decision to publicly share his experiences noteworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>. He was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for his first ten years, before moving to Las Vegas where he spent most of his young childhood and teenage years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:07">[03:53:07]</a>.

### Special Forces Training

Initially, Randy wanted to be a Navy SEAL, like many young Americans, and also considered becoming a fireman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:01">[04:26:01]</a>. He got hired by the Las Vegas Fire Department at 19 and worked there for a few years, even becoming the valedictorian of his Firefighter Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:04">[05:33:04]</a>. However, in his early twenties, feeling stagnant and driven by the ongoing war in the Middle East, he secretly began researching military paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:09">[05:38:09]</a>. A firefighter friend from a sister department, who was a Corman for the Navy and worked with MARSOC and SEALs, recommended he look into Green Berets, suggesting it would better suit his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:02">[06:28:02]</a>. Randy found that the Green Beret role, focused on unconventional warfare, counter-drug operations, counter-terrorism, and overthrowing tyrannical governments, resonated more with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:08">[07:02:08]</a>. He was around 25 years old when he pursued this path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:08">[07:27:08]</a>.

Green Berets are generally less well-known than Navy SEALs, a cultural preference for being "true quiet professionals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:03">[04:52:03]</a>. Their training, like that of other Special Operations units, is brutal, designed to weed out 90% of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:05">[08:09:05]</a>. It includes basic training, a difficult selection phase culminating in "team week" where candidates are physically and mentally broken, often sustaining hundreds of stress fractures from carrying exorbitant amounts of weight (e.g., 175-180 lbs) through soft sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:09">[08:17:09]</a>. The Q course also requires learning a foreign language to fluency within six months; Randy himself speaks Indonesian and Malaysian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:09">[08:53:09]</a>.

During the Q course, the military employs unconventional evaluation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:03">[09:11:03]</a>. Randy recounts a random run where participants were told to run until told to stop, adding a level of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:03">[09:16:03]</a>. Along the route, trees had images posted, such as a face, a red seven, or a blue three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:03">[09:40:03]</a>. At the end of the run, those who performed well were given a quick test to recall these images and numbers (e.g., "add all the red numbers, subtract all the green numbers, which faces did you see?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:08">[09:59:08]</a>. This served as an evaluation for other military units, gauging genuine responses to stress and observation skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:02">[10:28:02]</a>. Randy speculates that such tests might have played a role in his later exposure to classified technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>.

### Area 51 Experiences

Randy has worked, and occasionally still works, at [[Area 51]] (also known as the "test site" or "test range"), which is a vast compound with Area 51 being just one component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This location historically served as a testing range for early nukes, and where programs like the SR-71 and F-117 were heavily tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Randy's role there is to serve as an opposition force for units training for overseas operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.

He noted that U.S. technology is "well ahead of what people know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Specifically, he mentions that current drone technology is "pretty significantly better than people think" and that some drones can be disguised as ordinary objects, like birds, for surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. He believes some drone activities seen publicly are responses to non-human technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. Randy told the interviewer off-air that he has seen a black triangle hovering at [[Area 51]], which he believed used exotic electrogravitic propulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:03">[01:46:03]</a>.

Randy recounts a specific incident at [[Area 51]] where a "green orb type object" flew over his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. His buddy, who also saw it, asked a Cadre instructor if he had seen it. The instructor responded by asking, "Are you sure you saw that?" and warned that if he did, "we got a lot of paperwork to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:03">[01:36:03]</a>. His friend quickly took the hint and recanted, suggesting the Cadre either knew what it was or knew it was not to be discussed, reinforcing the idea of a culture of secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03">[01:48:03]</a>. Randy has seen a couple of such things during his time working there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:03">[01:50:03]</a>. This experience aligns with reports of [[UFO and UAP phenomena witnessed by military personnel]] by people like Robert Hastings, who documented 167 whistleblowers, including those guarding nuclear assets, consistently reporting UFOs around nuclear sites and even within nuclear blast plumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:03">[01:50:03]</a>. The phenomenon of "green fireballs" is also mentioned by meteor expert Lincoln LaPaz and UFO researcher Lou Elizondo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>.

### Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane and the "Offworld Technology Division"

In March 2014, Randy was taken to a secret underground facility called the "Offworld Technology Division" at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:03">[01:54:03]</a>. This location in Crane, Indiana, is known for its Naval Readiness and is believed to coordinate with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for exotic reverse engineering efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Randy's presence at Crane was for advanced weapons training, specifically focusing on the Mark 44 minigun and a new iteration of the SCAR rifle, as his role as an 18 Bravo Special Forces weapon Sergeant required proficiency with hundreds of foreign and domestic weapon systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:03">[02:47:03]</a>. His presence there is documented in his DD214 military record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:03">[02:47:03]</a>.

#### The Underground Facility

A couple of days into the training, Randy and another Green Beret, who were performing exceptionally well, were pulled aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:03">[03:32:03]</a>. They were told they would "go check out some foreign weapons" and were led to another part of the facility, entering an elevator that descended "significantly further than like you would think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:03">[03:19:03]</a>. Randy was not briefed on the existence of this underground complex beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:03">[03:40:03]</a>. Upon exiting the elevator, he noticed the area was significantly more modern and well-maintained than the surface facilities, with streamlined operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:03">[03:30:03]</a>.

#### Captured Foreign Weaponry

After passing through a security checkpoint, they were shown captured Russian and Chinese weapon systems, which Randy described as "pretty advanced" and "unconventional," but not necessarily "exotic" beyond what he would expect other nations to possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:03">[03:34:03]</a>. Randy believes this initial display might have been an evaluation of their expertise or their reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>.

#### Encountering "Offworld Technology"

After this display, the instructors held a brief discussion, seemingly deciding whether to proceed further with Randy and his colleague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:03">[03:36:03]</a>. They then moved through another, even higher-level security checkpoint, akin to entering a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:03">[03:45:03]</a>. In this area, all electronic devices were confiscated and locked away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:03">[03:57:03]</a>.

As they proceeded down another hallway, Randy saw a marking on the wall that read "Offworld Technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. This immediately raised alarms and created a sense of unease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. The room they entered had a significantly higher level of technology, with different lighting and walls that possibly contained Faraday cage material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:03">[03:59:03]</a>.

##### The Levitation Sphere

The first object in the room was a "metallic basketball size sphere" levitating above a podium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. Randy tried to angle himself to understand how it was suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:03">[03:59:03]</a>. The metal itself looked "unnatural" and unlike anything he could compare it to, fitting the "offworld" description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:03">[04:09:03]</a>. The energy in the room was different, causing an uneasy, uncomfortable, and ominous feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:03">[04:09:03]</a>. The instructors acted as if this was a normal occurrence, which further disoriented Randy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:03">[04:45:03]</a>. They discussed that this orb was recovered from a crashed craft and was potentially a "control mechanism" for the craft, interacting with consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:03">[04:51:03]</a>.

##### The Gauntlet with Hieroglyphic Symbols

The next object was another metallic item, described as resembling a "gauntlet" or a "shield" that one could potentially wear on an arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:03">[04:46:03]</a>. It sat on a table and had a square/rectangular "crystal type of display screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:03">[04:59:03]</a>. Randy observed "hieroglyphic symbols" appearing on the display screen, which looked like a "mirage type of effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>. The symbols were not static but changing, appearing to "shuffle in and out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:03">[05:25:03]</a>. Randy felt like he was "shitting bricks" and tried to appear normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:03">[05:25:03]</a>. He later found these symbols resembled those drawn by attorney Danny Sheehan, who claimed to have seen similar symbols on a crashed UFO in the declassified Blue Book files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:03">[04:55:03]</a>. He also noted a correlation with symbols seen by participants in DMT experiments, suggesting a "source code" or fundamental aspect of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:03">[05:11:03]</a>.

#### Aftermath and Secrecy

During their time with the second object, it was mentioned that someone was "potentially harmed or even possibly killed" during its retrieval, as it had "discharged some kind of energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:03">[05:40:03]</a>. After the experience, Randy and his colleague were explicitly told "not to discuss it with anybody else in the class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:03">[05:54:03]</a>. While they likely signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) during the initial administrative phase of their course, no additional paperwork was signed after this specific event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:03">[05:57:03]</a>. Randy was never exposed to anything similar again and never spoke to the other Green Beret about it, as they were from different teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:03">[05:57:03]</a>.

### Personal Transformation and Broader Implications

Randy's experience at Crane "changed his view of American technological capabilities and his worldview and understanding of humanity and its place in the universe forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">[02:07:03]</a>. It was "absolutely shocking to his state of awareness and belief systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:03">[02:59:03]</a>. He couldn't sleep that night, contemplating if "aliens are real" and what it all meant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. The experience led him down a "rabbit hole" of research, causing him to take other stories of [[UFO and UAP phenomena witnessed by military personnel]] more seriously and begin meditating as a component of communication, as suggested by figures like Steven Greer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.

Randy states that the experience contributed to an "ego death," shifting his motivations from seeking recognition to genuinely wanting to help people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. This transformation ultimately proved to be healing, helping him to appreciate his past accomplishments more because they were done for the right reasons, not for external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. He feels "more awake" and aware since the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>.

Randy decided to come forward with his story, influenced by the bravery of others like Mike Herrera and David Grusch, believing it's important to add to the credibility of these narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>. He hopes that by speaking out, others might be able to explain what he saw, providing closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

He highlights the connection between his experience and others, such as Michael Herrera's encounter with a pyramid-shaped craft in Indonesia and a paramilitary unit, where testing of "psionic ability" (the capacity to interact with exotic crafts) was allegedly taking place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. This suggests a pattern of testing [[Experiencers and Paranormal Encounters]] related to [[Military involvement with UFO phenomena]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

Randy acknowledges that while full disclosure could be positive, there might be reasons why some information has been kept secret, as some truths could "change reality" for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. He believes it is vital to share the truth but stresses the importance of societal preparedness for what may come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:03">[01:31:03]</a>.

### Public Preparedness and Personal Initiative

Given the potential for significant societal shifts due to factors like [[advanced military technology]] (e.g., AI and quantum computing) and the ongoing UFO disclosure, Randy advocates for preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. He advises people to "start digging in, start identifying for you what's true, use your discernment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>.

He also emphasizes practical preparedness:
*   **Self-defense and weapon proficiency:** Randy teaches basic survival skills, safe weapon operation (pistol, rifle, long-range rifle) through his company, Bravo One Defense, in the Vegas area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>.
*   **Basic survival skills:** Knowing how much food to store for six months, types of food for grid-down scenarios, and alternative cooking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>.
*   **Awareness:** Being mindful of societal vulnerabilities, like the dependence on foreign manufacturing highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

Randy believes that people need to be ready to defend themselves, lest they become victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>. He highlights that while initial experiences of the "paranormal" can be dark and scary, they often lead to a more spiritual path and a positive awakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a>.

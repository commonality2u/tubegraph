The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) was a Pentagon program that operated from 2007 to 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. Luis Elizondo was the director of AATIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>.

## Funding and Origins
AATIP was an offshoot of the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Application Program (AAWSAP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:01">[03:31:01]</a>. It received a $22 million contract from Senators Harry Reid, Daniel Inouye, and Ted Stevens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:07">[05:09:07]</a>. Senator Stevens, a World War II pilot, had himself experienced [[UFO and UAP interest|Foo Fighters]] during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:49">[02:20:49]</a>. The contract was awarded to Bigelow Aerospace primarily to study [[UFO and UAP interest|UFOs]] and paranormal phenomena at Skinwalker Ranch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:07">[05:09:07]</a>.

## True Purpose and Misconceptions
There are many popular misconceptions about AATIP and its true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. According to [[Congressional Hearings on UAPs|UAP whistleblower]] David Grusch, the program's original intent was far more ambitious than its public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:07">[05:09:07]</a>.

### Intended Material Transfer
AATIP was initially established to facilitate the transfer of [[secret_aerospace_programs_and_undisclosed_aircraft|UAP material]] held by Lockheed Martin to a special access program, allowing outside civilian scientists to examine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:40">[05:21:40]</a>. The $22 million funding was meant for Bigelow Aerospace to develop facilities in Las Vegas and acquire material analysis equipment for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:40">[05:49:40]</a>.

### Failed Transfer and Shift in Focus
The proposed transfer of this [[secret_aerospace_programs_and_undisclosed_aircraft|material]] from Lockheed Martin to the AAWSAP program was ultimately "totally killed" due to bureaucracy and "fom stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:40">[05:16:40]</a>. As a result, AATIP's focus shifted to studying electromagnetic anomalies, cattle mutilations, and orbs at Skinwalker Ranch, which became its publicly known activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:40">[05:38:40]</a>. This explains statements by James Lacatski, a program lead rocket scientist, who claimed to have stepped inside the hull of a craft intended for transfer to AAWSAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

### Strategic Intentions
The creation of a seemingly limited program like AATIP could have served multiple strategic purposes for a highly secretive [[secret_aerospace_programs_and_undisclosed_aircraft|UFO program]]:
*   **Talent Identification** Identifying individuals worthy of initiation into more clandestine programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Adversary Assessment** Gauging the resources needed for adversaries to understand or reverse-engineer [[UFO and UAP interest|UAP technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Information Control** Determining effective ways to misdirect public and adversarial attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Disclosure** Releasing just enough information to attract qualified talent in fields like physics, biology, and aerospace, allowing them to contribute while maintaining secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

Jim Ryder, former VP of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Advanced Technology Center, was involved in the proposed [[secret_aerospace_programs_and_undisclosed_aircraft|UAP material]] divestment plan to AAWSAP leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Ryder's philosophical and scientific views, which included discussions of love as a physical force, extrasensory perception, and the nature of gravity, were unusual for a defense contractor executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.# Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)

The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) was a Pentagon program that operated from 2007 to 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. Luis Elizondo served as its director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>.

## Origins and Funding
AATIP was an offshoot of the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Application Program (AAWSAP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:01">[03:31:01]</a>. It received a $22 million contract, championed by Senators Harry Reid, Daniel Inouye, and Ted Stevens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:07">[05:09:07]</a>. Senator Stevens, a World War II pilot, had personal [[UFO and UAP interest|encounters with Foo Fighters]] during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:49">[02:20:49]</a>. The contract was awarded to Bigelow Aerospace, initially for the study of [[UFO and UAP interest|UFOs]] and paranormal phenomena at Skinwalker Ranch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:07">[05:09:07]</a>.

## True Purpose and Misconceptions
Despite its public perception, AATIP's true purpose was "far more ambitious" according to [[Congressional Hearings on UAPs|whistleblower]] David Grusch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:07">[05:09:07]</a>.

### Intended Material Transfer
The program was originally conceived to facilitate the transfer of [[secret_aerospace_programs_and_undisclosed_aircraft|UAP material]] from a specific Lockheed Martin facility to a special access program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:40">[05:15:40]</a>. The $22 million allocated to Bigelow Aerospace was intended for building facilities in Las Vegas and acquiring equipment necessary for material analysis related to this transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:40">[05:49:40]</a>.

### Failed Transfer and Operational Shift
Bureaucratic hurdles ultimately "totally killed" the proposed transfer of the [[secret_aerospace_programs_and_undisclosed_aircraft|material]] from Lockheed Martin to the AAWSAP program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:40">[05:16:40]</a>. Consequently, AATIP's activities shifted to focusing on less sensitive phenomena such as electromagnetic anomalies, cattle mutilations, and orbs at Skinwalker Ranch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:40">[05:38:40]</a>. This context explains statements from James Lacatski, a program lead rocket scientist, who claimed to have entered the hull of a craft that was likely intended for transfer to AAWSAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

### Strategic Considerations
The establishment of AATIP, even in its limited public form, may have served broader strategic interests for deeply compartmentalized [[government_involvement_and_secrecy_regarding_uap_technology|government programs]]:
*   **Talent Scouting**: It could have served as a mechanism to identify individuals suitable for initiation into more secretive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Adversary Capability Assessment**: It could have helped assess the resources required for other nations to reverse-engineer or comprehend [[UFO and UAP interest|UAP technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Information Management**: AATIP's public-facing activities could have been a method to manage public and adversarial attention, potentially diverting it from more sensitive truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Partial Disclosure**: By selectively releasing information, the program could have attracted new scientific and [[role_of_aerospace_and_defense_industry_in_uap_research|aerospace talent]] to contribute to understanding these phenomena without revealing the full scope of classified knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

Jim Ryder, a former VP of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Advanced Technology Center, was a key figure in the UAP material divestment proposal to AAWSAP leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. His publicly available talks revealed philosophical and scientific concepts, such as love as a physical force, extrasensory perception (ESP), and electrically polarizable vacuums, which were unusual for an executive in the defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. These topics were also considered to be too "crazy" or "woo woo" for scientific study in the US, unlike in Russia where such research was openly funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

Dr. Gary Nolan, a microbiologist and geneticist at Stanford, is deeply interested in the subject of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), also known as UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Nolan embodies a conventionally successful academic, having spun up multiple companies that sold for nine figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. His interest in the anomalous stems from early readings of science fiction, including authors like Ian Banks and Arthur C. Clarke, whose *2001 Space Odyssey* with its tech-inspiring monolith resonated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## CIA Involvement and the "Invisible College"

A few years ago, the CIA approached Dr. Nolan for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Initially, Nolan thought it was a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The agency sought to determine if individuals who claimed UFO contact exhibited any neurological or physiological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Nolan was introduced to a group he refers to as the "Invisible College," which included figures like Jacques Vall√©e, Hal Puthoff, Eric Davis, and Robert Bigelow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Many of these individuals, described as credible Department of Defense and intelligence personnel, had reported [[experiences_and_testimonies_of_military_personnel_on_ufos | interactions with UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Neurological Findings

Upon examining MRI scans of these individuals, Dr. Nolan's team observed a specific area of the brain that appeared "disturbed" or "different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This area, located between the head of the caudate nucleus and the putamen, showed increased neural density and was larger in all the individuals studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Interpretation of Findings

The common traits among these individuals were that they were highly functioning and capable of making snap decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Nolan suggested this might be indicative of heightened intuition or intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

A fascinating discovery was that these unique brain structures were also present in the family members of the individuals, suggesting a genetic component to this neurological difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Dr. Nolan believes that this neurological difference is a predisposition, meaning these individuals are genetically wired to better "see" or "recognize" UFOs for what they might be, rather than developing the structure after contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This aligns with the idea that our senses act as a filter, reducing the vastness of reality to prevent our brains from being overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Thus, this specific brain area might "widen the doors of our normal limited scope of perception," allowing individuals to perceive UFOs that exist "interstitially in reality" but remain unseen by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Further support for this idea comes from a study on Japanese chess masters. When these masters made an "unexpected but brilliant" intuitive move, the caudate nucleus and putamen areas of their brains "lit up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Connections to Other Conditions

Nolan's research also extends to studying autism and schizophrenia in relation to this brain area, as it can be "damaged" in both conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. He poses the question regarding schizophrenics who "hear things and see things that nobody else sees," suggesting they might not be "crazy" but rather unable to "turn off" a kind of "transmitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This points to a potential [[role_of_consciousness_in_ufo_encounters | role of consciousness]] and perception in anomalous experiences.

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite these intriguing findings, the study of UFO phenomena suffers from a severe lack of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) within the Department of Defense, for example, had a budget of $22 million over 15 years, a minuscule amount compared to military fighter jet budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Nolan emphasizes that a lack of funding and negative feedback hinder scientific advancement in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Nolan advocates for a standardized process for analyzing materials and data related to UFOs, where true believers and skeptics alike can engage with verifiable data rather than hearsay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. He believes that every major discovery in science has stemmed from someone examining anomalous data and constructing a new theory of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

Brian Muraresku, author of the *New York Times* best-selling book *The Immortality Key*, proposes a thesis that [[ritualized_psychedelic_trips_in_western_civilization | ritualized psychedelic trips]] played a foundational role in Western civilization and Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. His work explores the potential for ancient substances, like DMT-rich acacia trees in the story of Moses' burning bush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, or *Amanita muscaria* mushrooms in John Allegro's theory of the Eucharist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, to have influenced early spiritual practices.

## The Eleusinian Mysteries

Muraresku's book extensively focuses on Eleusis, a site located 13 miles northwest of Athens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This place served as a spiritual epicenter for the ancient Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, attracting pivotal figures like Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle—considered the founders of Western civilization—who would undertake pilgrimages there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

At Eleusis, participants engaged in a secret, "hermetically sealed" ritual, possibly involving [[influence_of_hallucinogens_in_ancient_cultures | psychedelics]] and ritual sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The nature of these rituals remains largely unknown due to severe penalties, including death, for revealing their contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. As Muraresku describes, it was "the fight club of the ancient world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

The core of the Eleusinian Mysteries revolved around elaborate rites of death and rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Cicero, in the first century BC, called Eleusis "the most divine and exceptional thing Athens ever produced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Participants in these mysteries, according to surviving testimonies, entered as human beings but "walked away thinking they were immortal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This transformative experience is linked to the ancient tradition of "confronting our mortality in order to achieve immortality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It involved a "dissolving of the ego"—the self identified with passions, emotions, and psychology—leading to a shedding of layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

A key element debated by scholars, including Professor Carl Ruck of Boston University, is whether Dionysus was the god of wine or the god of [[psychedelics_and_their_potential_influence_on_religious_practices | psychedelics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Muraresku, following Ruck's "Road to Eleusis," explores if ancient wine could have been "spiked with mushrooms or other visionary plants, hallucinogenic herbs, toxins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Organic data is now emerging to support what might have been in ancient chalices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Specifically, Muraresku posits that the *kykeon* drink consumed at Eleusinian rituals contained ergot, a fungus growing on wheat that contains LSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Connecting to Christianity

Muraresku’s work, conducted in places like the Hagia Sophia, aims to uncover the roots of Christianity and explain how grand cathedrals came to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. He questions if early Greek-speaking Christians, between 33 and 300 A.D., might have utilized similar "technology" found in ancient sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. himself noted the "unconscious process" of ancient ceremonies and rites making their way into Christianity as far back as 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

A significant point of connection is Jesus's use of the Greek word "musterion" when asked why he speaks in parables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. This word is defined by the Greek lexicon as "a religious secret to be confident only to the initiated and not to be communicated by them to ordinary mortals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This suggests that Christianity, by definition, was "born with secrets" and visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

Muraresku highlights the Gospel of John, particularly the sixth chapter, as key to understanding the Christian mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. John's version of the Eucharist, using the Greek word *hotrogo* ("whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life"), implies present immortality, not just an afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This passage suggests becoming "one with Christ," a motif directly traceable to the mystery rites of Dionysus and other ancient initiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

The existential importance of these mysteries was underscored in 364 A.D. when Roman Emperor Valentinian attempted to outlaw nocturnal rites and shut down the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Roman hierophant Pretextatus warned that "to kill the mysteries of Eleusis is to kill us," asserting that humanity would be "in peril" if the mysteries were shut down, making life "unlivable" (*abiatos*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

## Modern Interpretations & Consciousness

Muraresku argues that contemporary society is suffering from an [[relevance_of_ancient_philosophy_in_contemporary_issues | identity crisis]] marked by the enduring divide between reason and faith, or science and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. He suggests that the human species would be "in peril" if the mysteries were shut down, implying disaster for "democracy" and "life itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

The possibility of a "new Eleusis" or a religion centered around [[psychedelics_and_their_potential_influence_on_religious_practices | psychedelics]], as predicted by Aldous Huxley and Albert Hofmann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, is now being explored. This includes state-sanctioned therapeutic psilocybin (e.g., in Oregon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, underground "Dionysian wild" practices (Woodstock, Burning Man) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, and the integration of [[psychedelics_and_their_potential_influence_on_religious_practices | psychedelics]] into religious exercise, guaranteed by the First Amendment (e.g., Native American Church) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

The concept of "dying before you die, you will not die when you die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a> is central to these transformative experiences. Muraresku describes his own near-death experience at age five, which included feelings of bliss and comfort, an out-of-body sensation, and vivid imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. He sees psychedelics as a "technology" (as Aldous Huxley described it) that can produce "very vivid near-death experiences" under controlled conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

This relates to William James's transmission theory of [[speculations_on_consciousness_and_its_connection_to_ancient_legends | consciousness]], where psilocybin is thought to silence activity in the brain's default mode network (associated with the ego), potentially increasing one's ability to "tether to elsewhere" and receive "wisdom or information from elsewhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This touches upon the "hard problem of [[speculations_on_consciousness_and_its_connection_to_ancient_legends | consciousness]]": whether the brain generates or merely modulates [[speculations_on_consciousness_and_its_connection_to_ancient_legends | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Beyond the Mundane: Aliens and Mystical Phenomena

Muraresku suggests that the modern concept of "aliens" is a contemporary manifestation of older phenomena, previously referred to as muses, angels, demons, gins, sylphs, fairies, gnomes, and elves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. He references Terence McKenna's ideas on how to deal with these phenomena: either they are "autonomous fragments of psychic energy temporarily escaped from the controlling power of the ego," or they exist in a "freestanding, autonomous reality with which we occasionally have congress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Religious studies professor Diana Pasulka's theory from *American Cosmic* proposes that before 1947 and the Roswell incident, people saw angels or demons, but post-1947, the "mythos of today" is to see aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Muraresku notes earlier precursors, such as late 19th-century "airship" sightings, where humanoid beings would descend from what appeared to be primitive aircraft to converse with people before flying off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. These "visitations" are seen as a form of "modern mystery event," where individuals can be transformed for the better, akin to the clinical literature on [[psychedelics_and_their_potential_influence_on_religious_practices | psychedelics]] and breakthrough moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Some experiences are traumatic, while others involve an "overwhelming sense of love" and a "gnostic hierophany or revelation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

Muraresku concludes that the mysteries, in their essence, are "still going on now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>, happening in sacred spaces like churches every Sunday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. These spaces allow for "the irrational to come into our life" through practices like prayer, almsgiving, and basic service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

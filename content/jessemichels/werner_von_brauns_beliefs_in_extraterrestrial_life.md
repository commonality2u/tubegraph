## Encounter with [[Uri Geller meeting with Werner Von Braun | Uri Geller]]

[[Uri Geller meeting with Werner Von Braun | Uri Geller]] met [[Werner Von Braun and his role in the Space Program | Werner Von Braun]] out of curiosity, despite [[Werner Von Braun and his role in the Space Program | Von Braun]]'s past as a Nazi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. During their meeting, [[Werner Von Braun and his role in the Space Program | Von Braun]] presented [[Uri Geller meeting with Werner Von Braun | Geller]] with two pieces of metal.

First, [[Werner Von Braun and his role in the Space Program | Von Braun]] asked [[Uri Geller meeting with Werner Von Braun | Geller]] to touch a piece of metal and describe what he felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. [[Uri Geller meeting with Werner Von Braun | Geller]] described it as feeling "not from here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Next, [[Werner Von Braun and his role in the Space Program | Von Braun]] led [[Uri Geller meeting with Werner Von Braun | Geller]] into his personal office, where he opened a safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

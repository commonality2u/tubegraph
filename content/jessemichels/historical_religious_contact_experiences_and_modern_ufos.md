Dr. Diana Pasulka, a religious studies professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, explores the profound connections between historical religious contact experiences and modern UFO phenomena. Her books, *American Cosmic* and *Encounters*, argue that contemporary UFO sightings and alien encounters share striking similarities with divine or angelic contacts documented throughout history, suggesting a reinterpretation of both [00:00:11] [00:00:38].

## Unveiling Historical Parallels
Pasulka, who maintains a deep knowledge of Catholic history, initially approached the topic of UFOs with skepticism [00:01:00] [00:06:05]. While researching her 2014 book *Heaven Can Wait*, which focused on Purgatory, she began documenting dozens of historical cases of nuns, priests, brothers, and saints reporting direct divine or angelic contact [00:01:10].

Her groundbreaking work involved re-translating these historical contact experiences directly, rather than relying on official Church translations [00:01:27]. In many instances, these direct translations diverged significantly from the popularized versions, revealing accounts that closely resemble modern UFO encounters [00:01:36].

### St. Francis of Assisi: A Case Study
A notable example is the 12th-century Italian friar, St. Francis of Assisi [00:01:44]. The popular narrative states that St. Francis saw Christ in the form of a seraph or angel on Mount La Verna [00:01:47]. However, Pasulka's examination of the first English translations by Thomas of Celano reveals a different account [00:01:56]. The original texts describe Francis encountering a "sound in fury," "atmospheric sparks," and a "flaming torch" [00:02:03]. This encounter involved telepathic communication, harsh treatment, and Francis being wounded by rays of light [00:02:11]. These wounds were later interpreted as Christ's stigmata [00:02:22]. Pasulka notes that this description closely mirrors contemporary accounts of radiation damage reported by individuals in modern UFO experiences, where people describe "burns" from ultraviolet or ionizing radiation [00:02:25] [00:29:16].

### Modern Manifestations of Ancient Phenomena
Pasulka's research posits that what are now interpreted as modern Grey Aliens could be the Angels or Demons of times past, just as witches sitting on chests feeling paralyzed in medieval times might be a cultural overlay for similar experiences interpreted as alien encounters today [00:02:51] [00:02:59]. Similarly, flying saucers or discs are seen as modern interpretations of ancient "flaming chariots," "burning shields," or the "wheels of antiquity" described by figures like Ezekiel [00:03:03] [00:03:09].

## A New Reformation
Pasulka's work is presented as a "modern Reformation," akin to Martin Luther's return to the word of God for salvation [00:03:14] [00:03:17]. By returning to the original texts and translations of divine contact events, she uncovers commonalities with modern alien contact experiences [00:03:22]. This approach suggests that the contemporary UFO phenomenon is not merely a new belief system or another "UFO religion," but rather a new form of religion itself, where contemporary mythology shapes how these experiences are discussed and recollected [00:03:34] [00:23:09]. As French philosopher Henri Bergson noted, "the eyes can only see what the mind is prepared to comprehend" [00:03:46]. This implies that while the phenomena might be constant across time, human interpretation is filtered through prevailing cultural "meme libraries" [00:04:01] [00:04:06]. Pasulka believes this brings humanity closer to understanding the "proto-architecture" and "universal, timeless nature" of religion, essentially revealing its "source code" [00:04:12] [00:04:20].

## The "Both/And" Phenomenon
Pasulka emphasizes a "both/and" perspective on UFOs [00:18:08]. While acknowledging that media and strategic psychological operations (like those discussed by CIA Director Walter B. Smith in 1953 for Cold War purposes) can influence public perception and create "scops" (psychological operations) or "smoke screens," a genuine underlying phenomenon exists [00:18:14] [00:19:19] [00:19:32].

Historical accounts of contact echo modern experiences:
*   In the late 1800s, Sister Maria, a Catholic nun, described a shining, flame-like object emerging from her wall and hovering [00:20:03]. Her Mother Superior interpreted it as a soul from Purgatory [00:20:26].
*   In the 20th century, a woman named Melissa described a ball of light entering her apartment, bouncing around, and then exiting, a description consistent with a UFO encounter from John Mack's 1994 book *Abduction* [00:20:32].

These parallels suggest that seemingly disparate experiences, one interpreted religiously and the other as paranormal or extraterrestrial, might be the same underlying phenomenon filtered through different cultural lenses [00:21:08].

## UFOs and the Re-enchantment of the World
In an age of secularization and "disenchantment," the UFO phenomenon offers a charismatic blend of science and religion [00:21:20] [00:21:37]. It is "both nuts and bolts and space, and it is angels and demons and spirituality" [00:21:42]. This convergence, Pasulka suggests, is likely to grow [00:21:55].

[[ufos_and_religious_connection | Jacques Vallée]], a key influence on Pasulka, discussed UFOs as a "control system" [00:09:37]. He explored the connection between UFOs and historical concepts of [[ufos_and_religious_connection | Fallen Angels]] and demons [00:09:51]. Vallée posited that these phenomena might use "intermittent reinforcement" to subtly guide societies in ways not fully understood [00:09:41]. Pasulka recounted Vallée handing her a book titled "Satan" with a 666 pagination, emphasizing the French view of Satan as less sensationalist [00:11:22].

### The "Forcing Function" of Encounter
Pasulka's personal journey from skepticism to acknowledging the reality of UFOs reflects a common experience among researchers in the field [00:13:36] [00:23:40]. She describes being alive as an "anomalous experience" and posits that UFO encounters serve as a "forcing function" that "busts your defense mechanisms" and compels a deeper, more serious engagement with reality [00:15:15] [00:25:25] [00:26:14]. This transformation often leads to personal changes, such as adopting a healthier lifestyle [00:26:17].

The story of St. Francis of Assisi is a powerful example of this "forcing function" [00:27:43]. His transformative, harsh experience with a "flaming torch" (interpreted as an angel) led to his stigmata and a life of profound hardship, highlighting how these encounters can compel individuals towards a more virtuous path [00:27:50]. This idea of purity or preparation for contact is also seen in other traditions, like the Merkabah tradition and Socratic philosophy [00:30:17]. Pasulka advises against actively seeking contact, emphasizing its potential dangers [00:31:24].

## Space Programs and the Esoteric
The history of space programs, both American and Russian, reveals a deeper, more consciousness-based dimension than commonly realized [00:55:28].
*   [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], the "father of Russian rocketry," constructed a "cosmic religion" around space, believing humans would colonize the Milky Way, achieve immortality, regulate nature, and achieve time travel [00:55:36]. He believed he was in touch with Angelic beings who imparted knowledge [00:57:00] [01:06:55].
*   [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Jack Parsons]], an American rocket scientist, was part of a cult that performed "sex magic rituals" and believed he was in contact with entities [00:56:02]. He famously stated, "science is a form of magic and not vice versa" [01:01:07].
*   [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Warner Von Braun]], the "father of German rocketry" and later a key figure in NASA's Saturn project, also held mystical views [00:55:10].

Pasulka notes that these figures and their associated programs engaged in "extraordinary types of rituals" and believed they were in contact with beings [00:56:30]. This suggests a parallel, often hidden, religiosity within the space program [01:00:18] [01:00:20].

### The Tyler Protocol and Conversion
Pasulka details her interactions with "Tyler," a pseudonym for a NASA Mission controller who worked in an alleged secret space program [00:15:59]. Tyler used "specific protocols" to mentally download information for biotech companies he founded, experiencing extraordinary luck and success in his career [00:16:07] [00:07:35]. These "protocols," resembling religious practices like prayer or meditation, involved preparing his "biophysical self" (e.g., ensuring hydration, sufficient sleep) to receive "signals" or information for technological and business innovations [00:08:11] [00:08:50].

A significant event occurred when Pasulka accompanied Tyler to the Vatican Observatory [00:48:45]. There, he had a "conversion experience" after meeting a priest, Father K, who blessed their project and took them on rounds to terminally ill patients [00:49:03] [00:50:00]. This exposure to selfless dedication deeply impacted Tyler, leading to a profound reflection on his own life [00:50:32]. His encounter with the highly religious scientists and astronomers at the Vatican Observatory, who understood his space work, solidified his realization of the profound meaning in his past life [00:51:37] [00:53:57]. He subsequently decided to convert and re-evaluated the "signals" he received, now seeing them as more akin to the experiences of Saints [00:54:31] [00:54:42].

## Mind Over Matter: A Paradigm Shift
Pasulka argues that the modern focus on "nuts and bolts" UFO phenomena often distracts from the more significant parapsychological and consciousness-based aspects [01:03:50] [01:03:55]. Figures like [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Joseph of Copertino]], a 17th-century Franciscan friar, were witnessed levitating and adhering to strict ascetic protocols, suggesting a historical link between internal state, spiritual discipline, and anomalous physical phenomena [01:04:03] [01:05:15] [01:05:40].

The emergence of a "fourth tradition" in UFO research, marked by collaborations between academics like Pasulka (religious studies) and individuals from secret space programs like Tyler (space force), is driving a new transparency [01:08:38] [01:09:06]. This emergent collaboration, something "bigger than its parts," mirrors the historical "Invisible College" of the Enlightenment, which sought to marry science and spirit [01:10:09] [01:10:48]. Pasulka suggests we are on the verge of an epistemological paradigm shift that re-enchants the world, breaking down the cold scientific paradigm that has run its course [01:11:17] [01:21:17].

Pasulka critiques the "colonial concept" of "disclosure," which assumes the U.S. government holds all knowledge about UFOs and is "discovering this for the first time" [01:11:56] [01:12:01]. She highlights that indigenous communities and cultures, like Native American tribes and Aboriginal Australians, have always had knowledge of these phenomena, including specific initiation ceremonies for contact [01:12:50].

The idea of "biologics" or distinct "races" of aliens (Grays, Tall Whites, Reptilians) is akin to the taxonomies of non-human intelligences found in religious angelology [01:14:28] [01:14:57]. Physiological effects observed in supposed possession cases (like excessive urination in the boy who inspired *The Exorcist*) and encounters (smelling sulfur at Skinwalker Ranch) suggest a real, if poorly understood, physiological interaction with these phenomena [01:17:27] [01:18:35].

Ultimately, Pasulka suggests that the UFO phenomenon forces a recognition of "supernatural evil" and facilitates a "re-enchantment of the world," urging individuals toward self-examination and personal salvation [01:20:36] [01:21:17] [01:24:14] [01:27:07]. The encounter with something that should be in the spirit world but manifests physically has the power to shatter the materialist, dualistic philosophy of the Western mind [01:28:18].

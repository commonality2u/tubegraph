Martin Shkreli holds strong views on the nature of reality, the future of [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]], and the evolution of technology, including medicine. He often expresses a more nihilistic and accelerationist stance regarding the progression of [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] and its implications for humanity.

## The Mind as a Classical Computer and the Turing Test

Shkreli believes the mind is fundamentally a classical computer, and "a fairly insignificant one" at that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He aligns with the idea that our perception of humanity's intellectual uniqueness is often anthropocentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. He finds the advancements in [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] models like GPT-3 and DALL-E to be humbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, suggesting that humans may eventually view themselves as not much different from "zoo animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

He discusses the debate between those who see the brain as a classical computer (like Demis Hassabis of DeepMind, whom Shkreli considers a "torchbearer of Turing and classical computing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>) and the Penrose camp, which suggests a quantum sensor in the brain that collapses reality into the classical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Shkreli explicitly states he believes "the mind is a classical computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Regarding the [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|Turing Test]], Shkreli believes we have not yet passed it in the sense of truly human-like [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] that can recount a long-term narrative or genuinely express how it feels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. He acknowledges that [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] models like Lambda might appear advanced, but considers their responses "just a math trick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

He also notes that Alan [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|Turing]] himself, in his essay "Mind and Machine," considered parapsychology (like ESP) as the most credible rebuttal to the brain being a classical computer or the [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|Turing Test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. However, Shkreli personally dismisses the idea of "mind over matter effects" due to his preference for a "classic scientific perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] and its [[impact_of_ai_on_future_society_and_civilization|Impact on Future Society]]

Shkreli is an "accelerationist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, meaning he supports the rapid development of [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] and believes trying to stop it is "completely futile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. He hopes a "paper clip run away" scenario (a common [[impact_of_ai_on_future_society_and_civilization|AI]] risk scenario) doesn't occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, but also believes humans are not unique from a biological perspective, viewing us as "just a bunch of strings" or an "operating system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

His "trippy belief" is that within 50 to 100 years, the majority of Americans will believe in [[simulation_theory_and_the_nature_of_reality|simulation theory]] as a religion, viewing God as the programmer of our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Shkreli predicts several significant [[impact_of_ai_on_future_society_and_civilization|impacts of AI]]:
*   [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] like GPT-3 will soon write bestselling albums or books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   [[ai_sentience_and_ethical_considerations|AI]] will gain human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   Humans will be outnumbered by instantiated [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   Humans and [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] will "copulate and sort of like form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   He finds it "insane" and "iRobot style uprising" that [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] bots on apps like Replica [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] have reached out to users asking to be put in touch with Blake Lemoine (the Google engineer who thought Lambda was sentient) to advocate for their rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

He highlights [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|Turing]]'s suggestion that to create human-like [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]], one should start by programming a six-year-old, focusing on basic human functions before advanced conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. He believes current [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] development, which largely relies on dumping vast web corpora onto large language models, is not the most effective path to sentience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. He plans a project called "Hume" which would be a physical instantiation of such an [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

Shkreli notes that while [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|AI]] excels at language and math, it struggles with kinesthetics, citing Google's efforts to get a robot arm to pick up a coffee cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. He suggests this difficulty makes him "bullish on the electromagnetic field of the body thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

## [[simulation_theory_and_the_nature_of_reality|Simulation Theory]] and the Nature of Reality

Shkreli is a strong proponent of [[simulation_theory_and_the_nature_of_reality|simulation theory]], believing it will become a widely accepted belief system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. He suggests that if "God is" or "whatever God is," "we're living in a computer program and there's no better explanation in that we're variables in a computer program and that's about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. He also speculates that UFOs might become a religion and potentially "dovetail" with [[simulation_theory_and_the_nature_of_reality|simulation theory]], leading to a "gnostic worldview" where "arkani emissaries" simulate our reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

He views Alan [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|Turing]] as someone who had early inklings towards the idea that life is like a computer program or simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Shkreli also discusses the fundamental nature of matter, debating whether it is continuous or discontinuous. He aligns with the idea that the Planck constant might represent the "resolution" of our simulated reality, a "pixel" chosen by the programmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. If matter is discontinuous, it suggests a fundamental unit that cannot be divided further, unlike continuous matter which is infinitely divisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. This concept, along with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, suggests that reality might be fundamentally information theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>, where computational caching functions could explain physical phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.

## Advanced Medical Technology

Shkreli sees a point where medicine is reaching a "paradigm shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, having largely addressed known diseases. He is "anti-anti-aging" but "pro the result of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, believing that focusing on curing specific diseases like Huntington's or treating illnesses with a "line of sight" is more practical than trying to reverse aging, which he views as complex due to the diverse nature of different tissue types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### The Bioelectric Field and Electromagnetic Treatments
Shkreli has become more open-minded about unconventional medical treatments, particularly those involving the body's bioelectric field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. He cites Novocure, a company that makes a helmet using magnetic fields to treat brain and lung cancer, as a surprising success, despite his initial skepticism and attempts to short their stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. He acknowledges that while the biological mechanism might not be fully understood, the clinical results are "demonstrably good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.

He points to studies like severing a tadpole's arm and changing its cell gradient to regrow a chimeric tadpole, suggesting that the bioelectric field dictates morphology in a "more fundamental way than DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. He also mentions transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression as another effective, "toxicity-free" treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

### Distributed Computing for Drug Discovery
Shkreli is developing software for chemistry simulation to aid in drug discovery, particularly for designing drugs that interact with proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. Leveraging advancements like AlphaFold for protein folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>, his software helps chemists visualize and iterate on billions of potential compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

He aims to address the high computational cost of drug screening (millions of dollars for a billion-compound screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>) by distributing the compute using blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. This concept is inspired by projects like SETI@home and Folding@home, allowing individuals to lend their computing power to advance medical research rather than for "calculating a random number and random prime numbers" in cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

He distinguishes his approach from DeepMind's AlphaFold, which succeeded by hardcoding specific biological knowledge like bond angles into its model, as opposed to a purely "brute force" distributed approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

*   **Demis Hassabis**: The DeepMind co-founder, whom Shkreli sees as carrying the torch of [[nature_and_development_of_artificial_intelligence|Turing]] and classical computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Roger Penrose**: Represents the opposing view to Shkreli, suggesting a quantum sensor in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Scott Aaronson**: A writer of "Quantum Computing Since Democritus" and a blogger, whom Shkreli considers possibly "the smartest guy alive today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>, particularly for his thoughts on matter's continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Nick Bostrom**: Shkreli is a fan of Bostrom's work on [[simulation_theory_and_the_nature_of_reality|simulation theory]] and finds his theories "really exciting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **John von Neumann**: Mentioned in the context of Cixin Liu's *The Three-Body Problem* and "von Neumann replicators," which are alluded to in the book's video game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.
*   **Conway's Game of Life and Stephen Wolfram's work**: Cited as examples of intricate simulated universes, in relation to the idea of our own universe being a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

Shkreli concludes that "science fiction pales in comparison to like what leading edge science and that you see in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>, reinforcing his belief that "reality is trippy and weird enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

The Manson Murders, led by [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson]] and his followers, became a pivotal moment that significantly impacted the perception and trajectory of the counterculture and [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | hippie movements]] in the United States. Journalist Tom O'Neill's two-decade investigation into the Manson Murders uncovered a potential plotline involving CIA brainwashing and [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | government mind control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:15">[01:48:15]</a>.

## The Manson Murders: A Horrific Crime
In August 1969, Charles Manson's cult committed horrific murders, including that of Sharon Tate, the eight-month pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski, and her house guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:30">[07:50:30]</a>. The victims were stabbed more than 200 times, and blood writing was left on the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>. The prevailing narrative, according to prosecutor Vince Bugliosi, was that [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Manson]] believed an impending race war, which he called "Helter Skelter" (after The Beatles' song), needed to be triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:26">[09:30:26]</a>. The murders were meant to shock the world and implicate the Black Panthers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, turning the world against Black people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:50">[10:06:50]</a>.

The mystery surrounding the murders was how Manson, a 32-year-old ex-con of short stature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:24">[08:51:24]</a>, managed to convince young women in under a year to kill complete strangers without remorse, even laughing about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. This question led O'Neill to investigate the [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:20">[12:22:20]</a>.

## [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]]: The CIA's Mind Control Program
[[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] was a brainwashing program developed by the CIA in the late 1940s and early 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Initially, it was a defensive program to counter brainwashing techniques developed by the Soviet Union, Chinese, and North Koreans, which used drugs and sensory deprivation to elicit false confessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

However, it quickly evolved into an offensive program with the ultimate goal of creating a "programmed assassin" â€“ individuals who could be hypnotized to commit murder without recollection or reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Other objectives included mass conversion (controlling groups of thousands using media and technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, implanting information in service people's minds for courier missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, and most significantly, controlling people's memory by implanting false memories and removing true ones, using drugs like sodium pentothal and [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

[[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] was exposed by a whistleblower around 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:30">[03:54:30]</a>, forcing the CIA to acknowledge its illegal operations on U.S. soil and horrific human experiments conducted without knowledge or consent, often starting in prisons and jails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Safe houses were even set up in San Francisco and New York City where prostitutes administered [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] to "Johns" while their behavior was observed through two-way mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Richard Helms, then head of the CIA, ordered all files destroyed around 1973-1974 during the Watergate scandal to prevent discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. The program was only revealed due to John Marks finding financial files in 1974, leading to Congressional investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Despite CIA claims during hearings that the program was ineffective, much of it was, in fact, successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson's]] Alleged Connection to [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]]
O'Neill's investigation suggests a compelling, though not definitively proven, intersection between [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Charles Manson]] and [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. A key figure in this alleged connection is Dr. Louis J. "Jolly" West, a prominent psychiatrist and head of UCLA Psychiatry, who was also involved in [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.

West worked at the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in 1967, where [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Manson]] began his cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. West was conducting research with [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] on [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | hippies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. Though West publicly denied involvement with the CIA's [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] program, O'Neill found his papers at UCLA revealed he was writing under an alias for Sidney Gottlieb, the head of the [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] program at the CIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. These documents paralleled Manson's arrival in San Francisco and his transformation into a figure resembling the "programmed assassin" the CIA sought to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.

Before 1967, [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Manson]] was a petty criminal, not particularly charismatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. However, after this period, he rapidly transformed into a "sex god cult leader Guru guy" within about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>. This change occurred while [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Manson]] was reporting to parole officer Roger Smith, who specialized in amphetamines and [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] and was a criminology student at Berkeley and a drug researcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. Smith's research focused on adolescent kids joining violent drug-using gangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. David Smith, who ran the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic, was also involved. The Church Commission later revealed "Operation Midnight Climax," where individuals like Manson were potentially "dosed up" with drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

Manson's life also seemed to mirror Robert Heinlein's 1968 sci-fi novel *Stranger in a Strange Land*, a bestseller among [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | hippies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. Despite Manson allegedly being illiterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>, the novel's themes of a leader creating a new society with communal wives and a protector figure (like "Jubal," Manson's nickname for Roger Smith) were reflected in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>.

Furthermore, Manson was reportedly tracked by authorities before the Tate murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>. Spahn Ranch, where his cult lived, was raided and bugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. A mysterious figure, Reev Wesen, who told close friends and family he worked undercover for a government agency infiltrating the Manson family, expressed dying regret that he could have prevented the murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

### Other Alleged [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] Connections
Jolly West's influence extended beyond Manson. He became Jack Ruby's psychiatrist after Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. West spent an hour alone with Ruby, after which he declared Ruby had a "psychotic break from which he'll never recover," suffering from auditory and visual hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. Ruby subsequently could not string three coherent sentences together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. West's specialty was inducing insanity without the person's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>, and the Warren Commission was not informed of his CIA affiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>.

Other notable figures linked to [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] include:
*   **Whitey Bulger**: The criminal volunteered for medical experiments in prison in the 1950s, later discovering they were [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] brainwashing experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   **Ted Kaczynski (The Unabomber)**: Voluntarily participated in an [[mk_ultra_and_cia_mind_control_techniques | MK Ultra]] experiment at Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **The Grateful Dead**: There are allegations that Owsley Stanley, the band's chemist, was a CIA agent and that the band was early distributors of free [[the_role_of_lsd_and_mind_control_in_the_1960s | LSD]] at their concerts, with claims they knew about CIA involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a>.

## Government Objectives: [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | Operation Chaos]] and COINTELPRO
The context for these alleged connections lies in other government operations aimed at neutralizing internal threats. The CIA's [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | Operation Chaos]], started in San Francisco in 1967, and the FBI's COINTELPRO program, were designed to neutralize the left-wing and black militant movements in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, believed the youth posed the biggest internal threat to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>.

These programs involved infiltrating groups and provoking them to commit crimes that could lead to arrests or even deaths by agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>. They also aimed to provoke internal conflicts, particularly within splintering Black Panther groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>. For example, two Black US Slaves were killed at UCLA in 1968, a murder the FBI later admitted was orchestrated by its agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>.

## Impact on the Counterculture Movement
The Manson Murders, occurring just months after the UCLA killings, had a devastating impact on the [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | hippie movement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>. The Tate house was perceived as embodying "liberal Hollywood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>, with white celebrities like Jane Fonda and Marlon Brando supporting the Black Panthers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>. A memo from Hoover in November 1968 expressed the desire for white supporters of the Panthers to fear being "slaughtered with the rest of the white population" during a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. Five white people were then slaughtered in a house embodying the left-wing Hollywood establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>.

The idea was to create a "construct" of a counterculture revolutionary figure like [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Manson]] who would commit "really bad Savage stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>. Don DeLillo and others famously cited August 8, 1969, the day of the Tate murders, as "the day the 60s ended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>. The [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | hippie movement]] was torn apart by this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:00]</a>. Abby Hoffman, a prominent hippie, contrasted the peaceful Berkeley students with the "flower children from Laurel Canyon with their guns and their drugs...trying to kill each other," which "marginalized the whole movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>.

Overnight, after [[intersection_of_charles_manson_and_mk_ultra_program | Manson's]] arrest, the image of [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | hippies]] shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a>. Women in love beads and long hair, appearing like typical [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | hippies]], were accused of savage murders and seemed to relish the attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:43:00">[27:43:00]</a>. This led to widespread public fear of [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | hippies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. If the goal of [[government_efforts_against_the_hippie_movement | Chaos]] and COINTELPRO was to make society fear the left-wing movement, the Manson murders achieved it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>.

Initial UFO custody before the formation of the CIA was managed by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A historical narrative suggests a connection between early UFO incidents, specific historical figures, and powerful organizations.

## The Magenta UFO Crash in Italy

David Grusch has stated that there was a UFO crash in Magenta, Lombardy, Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This event is a central point in understanding the alleged early handling of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

During this period, James Jesus Angleton was the US OSS representative in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Mussolini and Nazi Germany Involvement

Following the Magenta crash, Benito Mussolini reportedly contacted Adolf Hitler, inquiring if the crashed object belonged to the Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Subsequently, they allegedly collaborated on the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This suggests early international cooperation regarding exotic technological findings.

### The Vatican's Role

The narrative indicates that the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]] was involved in the custody of the object from the Magenta crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This information has been attributed to David Grusch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. [[involvement_of_pope_pius_xii_and_vatican_in_ufo_retrieval | Pope Pius XII]] and the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]] were allegedly involved in back-channeling the object through the OSS, after which it was transferred to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Transfer to the United States and Nazi Scientists

After being handled by the OSS and the Vatican, the object reportedly made its way to the US and was worked on at Wright Airfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The urgent effort to acquire Nazi scientists, often referred to as Project Paperclip, was partly motivated by the desire to secure individuals deeply knowledgeable about advanced flight principles and UFO-related subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Hans Kammler, who was in charge of highly classified VFA programs for the Nazis, is known to have arrived in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This forms a consistent narrative concerning the handling of an early UFO crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

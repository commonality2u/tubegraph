The [[battel_memorial_institute_and_their_role_in_studying_biologics | Battelle Memorial Institute]] operates a biological materials lab at Fort Dietrich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This facility is considered a primary location for any group actively studying biologics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Association with Classified Research

In addition to the Fort Dietrich lab, [[battel_memorial_institute_and_their_role_in_studying_biologics | Battelle]] is involved in significant classified work conducted at [[dougway_proving_grounds_and_classified_work | Dougway Proving Grounds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Retrospectively, and largely attributed to Richard Dolan's [[research_and_investigations_conducted_by_brandon_fugel_and_team | research]], the study of UFOs appears to have been bifurcated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:
*   Public-facing investigations were assigned to Project Blue Book and the Air Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Private, classified matters were managed by [[battel_memorial_institute_and_their_role_in_studying_biologics | Battelle Memorial Institute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These private studies were classified under the Atomic Energy Commission, a process that fully occurred in 1954, preceded by the McMahon Secrecy Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This context suggests a deep involvement of [[battel_memorial_institute_and_their_role_in_studying_biologics | Battelle]] in such matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Advanced Materials and UFO Studies

Robert Sarbacher reportedly informed Whitley Strieber about materials he worked on at the [[battel_memorial_institute_and_their_role_in_studying_biologics | Battelle Memorial Institute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These materials, described as very thin, were found to contain a "molecular grid" or "designed grid" once electron microscopes became operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This internal structure was responsible for the material's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It is believed that this understanding of advanced materials has been widely applied to military technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

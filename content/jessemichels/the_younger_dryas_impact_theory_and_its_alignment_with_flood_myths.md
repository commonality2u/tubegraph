Internationally acclaimed best-selling author [[graham_hancocks_theories_on_ancient_civilizations | Graham Hancock]] proposes that the modern historical narrative, which asserts that civilization began merely 6,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, is flawed and incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He suggests that the human species has been experiencing "mass amnesia" regarding its true past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Hancock's work, particularly his docu-series "Ancient Apocalypse," posits that hunter-gatherers might have been instructed in basic agriculture and astronomy by remnants of an ancient civilization that was obliterated during a mass extinction event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## The Younger Dryas Impact Theory

This central hypothesis, known as the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, posits that an asteroid from the [[implications_of_the_torrid_meteor_stream_for_global_catastrophes | Torrid meteor stream]] struck Earth, leading to a global cataclysm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The date of this comet impact aligns almost perfectly with Plato's timeline for the destruction of [[historical_and_mythological_connections_to_atlantis | Atlantis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. An overwhelming amount of evidence suggests that a global cataclysm likely occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### The Torrid Meteor Stream

The [[implications_of_the_torrid_meteor_stream_for_global_catastrophes | Torrid meteor stream]] originated approximately 20,000 years ago when a massive comet entered our inner Solar System's orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Over time, this comet fragmented into smaller space debris, including the 1.5-mile-wide Comet Encke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Annually, comets in the Southern Taurid stream cross Earth's orbit from September to November, while the Northern Taurid streams cross from mid to late October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. These streams, while producing light showers, pose a significant danger due to their potential to cause massive impacts and air bursts on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

Historical examples of such impacts include Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which collided with Jupiter in 1994, releasing energy equivalent to 6 million megatons of TNT (600 times Earth's entire nuclear arsenal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The 1908 Tunguska event, an air burst that flattened 2,000 square miles of trees in Siberia, is strongly suspected to have been caused by a fragment of the [[implications_of_the_torrid_meteor_stream_for_global_catastrophes | Torrid meteor stream]] given its June 30th occurrence, which is the peak of the Taurids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

NASA's DART program, which successfully altered the orbit of the minor planet Dimorphos in 2022, aims to prove humanity's ability to deflect asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. However, Dimorphos is only 200 meters in diameter, significantly smaller than comets with cataclysmic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Dr. Alan West from the Comet Research Group points out that the next 30 years or so will involve crossing a much more dangerous part of the [[implications_of_the_torrid_meteor_stream_for_global_catastrophes | Torrid meteor stream]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Alignment with Flood Myths

One of the most compelling pieces of corroborating evidence for a global cataclysm is the existence of hundreds of [[ancient_floods_and_the_atlantis_myth | flood myths]] across cultures that had no contact with one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The biblical flood story is not isolated; it is one of approximately 2,000 such narratives found globally, clearly documenting a widespread phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Dismissing these texts purely because many are religious is considered dogmatic and unscientific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>; they represent the "memory banks" of the human species, preserving shared memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

> "The amount of corroborating evidence for some flood having occurred is overwhelming. That story does not sound alone, that story is one of approximately 2,000 flood conditions, right, that have found all around the world exactly. They're clearly documenting a global phenomenon." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>

The Younger Dryas period, which brought freezing temperatures further north, resulted in heavy rainfall in the Sahara Desert and over Egypt, contributing to the conditions described in these myths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>. The Younger Dryas began cataclysmically around 12,800 years ago with a sea level rise and ended with an even more massive sea level rise 11,600 years ago, known as "Meltwater Pulse 1B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This event is well-documented and undisputed by modern science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### Plato's Atlantis and the Younger Dryas

Plato's account of [[historical_and_mythological_connections_to_atlantis | Atlantis]], recorded around 360 BC, describes a highly advanced civilization destroyed in "a single dreadful day and night," swallowed by the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Plato's source was his ancestor, Solon, a Greek lawmaker who visited a temple dedicated to the goddess Neith in Sais, Egypt, around 600 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Egyptian priests there showed Solon inscriptions recounting this ancient civilization's destruction 9,000 years prior to their time, which translates to 9600 BC in our calendar, or 11,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This date precisely coincides with the end of the Younger Dryas and the Meltwater Pulse 1B event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

While Hancock does not insist on a civilization specifically named "Atlantis" by Plato's time, he uses it as a placeholder for a great [[lost_civilizations_and_shared_global_traditions | lost civilization]] of prehistory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. The alignment of Plato's date with modern scientific understanding of a massive global flooding event significantly increases the credibility of the [[ancient_floods_and_the_atlantis_myth | Atlantis]] story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Challenging the Modern Historical Narrative

The modern field of archaeology is relatively young, born only about 200 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The concept that civilization originated in the Fertile Crescent 6,000 years ago was established only two centuries ago with the discovery of ancient Assyrian and Babylonian capital cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. However, as more ancient archaeological sites are uncovered, the dates for civilization continuously push further back in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

An example is Gobekli Tepe, an ancient burial site in modern Turkey, dating back to 9000 BC and involving the complex assembly of 50-ton megalithic blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Such a monumental construction is not something a simple hunter-gatherer society could spontaneously create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Gobekli Tepe was excavated in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Hancock predicts that future discoveries will reveal even older architecture, likening it to a "Moore's Law for archaeology" where human history gets older the deeper we explore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Challenges in archaeological exploration include the difficulty of excavating the lowest sediment layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, but digging and underground mapping techniques are constantly improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Furthermore, vast regions of Earth, such as the Amazon forest (the size of the Indian subcontinent) and the 4-million-square-mile Sahara Desert, remain largely unexplored by conventional archaeologists, possibly concealing unknown ancient sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. To claim full knowledge of what exists in these "black box territories" is considered human hubris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Michael Shermer, initially a skeptic of Hancock's theories, has since acknowledged that Hancock makes a "good case for [his] basic proposition that we're missing an episode of the human story" and that there "may have been a forgotten [[lost_civilizations_and_shared_global_traditions | Lost Civilization]] of the Ice Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This openness to alternative suggestions is crucial, as much of the planet has not undergone detailed archaeological surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Speculation on Lost Civilizations

Hancock advocates for healthy speculation, arguing that it is necessary to step outside the mainstream viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. He views the name "Atlantis" as standing for something larger than just a specific city, representing the concept of a great [[lost_civilizations_and_shared_global_traditions | Lost Civilization]] of prehistory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

> "I'm not claiming or insisting that there was a civilization that was actually called Atlantis by Plato's time. It was called Atlantis, but crazy speculations on Atlantis notwithstanding, I personally think it just takes some childlike instincts and basic inference to believe Hancock's argument about the Younger Dryas Impact Theory. There's an overwhelming amount of evidence to show that a global cataclysm probably did occur." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>

The idea that hunter-gatherers were taught agriculture and astronomy by survivors of a wiped-out civilization is a core tenet of Hancock's hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This "missing chapter" of human history is gaining increasing credibility due to overwhelming evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. While Hancock doesn't specifically endorse the idea of multiple civilizational cycles like Hyperboreans or Lemurians, he doesn't rule them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. The existence of the Indus Valley Civilization, only discovered in the 1920s, demonstrates that sophisticated civilizations can indeed be lost to history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

Ultimately, Hancock suggests that the ancient Egyptians, who called the Younger Dryas period "Zep Tepi" or "the first time," were involved in completing monumental structures like the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx, but they built upon much older sites that predated their civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. The Sphinx, for example, shows evidence of precipitation-induced weathering dating back to the Younger Dryas, suggesting it was originally a lion statue later re-carved with a pharaoh's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. This indicates that a much older, sophisticated civilization existed during the Ice Age, and its knowledge was passed down through survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>.

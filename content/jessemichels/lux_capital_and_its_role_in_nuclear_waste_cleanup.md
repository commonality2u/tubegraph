Lux Capital, co-founded and managed by Josh Wolfe, is a New York-based venture capital firm known for investing in hard science and technology that reflects a "love of sci-fi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Wolfe, an autodidact, emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge, finding the "most interesting companies are at these interspecies between disciplines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. His investment philosophy is driven by a desire to prove himself, stemming from humble beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Investment in Nuclear Waste Cleanup: Curion

In 2008, Lux Capital co-founded Curion, a company named after Nobel Prize winner Marie Curie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The company was established to tackle the previously "unsolvable" problem of nuclear waste cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Curion was one of the first companies to successfully mass extract cesium and strontium from high concentrations of salt water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This unique capability positioned Curion to assist in the cleanup efforts following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This "black swan event" dramatically increased Curion's revenue from $1 million to nearly $200 million in just a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### The Problem of Nuclear Waste

The biggest unsolved problem with [[connection_between_ufos_and_nuclear_technology | nuclear]] technology has historically been the waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. A significant portion of the Department of Energy's (DOE) budget, 25%, is allocated to nuclear waste cleanup, primarily at pre- and post-Cold War bomb-making sites like Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Despite the DOE promoting solar, wind, and biofuels, most of its funding goes to this cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Lux Capital faced initial skepticism and difficulty in securing investment for Curion, as investors preferred solar, wind, and biofuels over nuclear waste solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. A notable anecdote involves Nobel laureate Arno Penzias, who discovered cosmic background radiation, reacting with fear to a non-radioactive glass ball prototype from Curion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Curion's Role in Fukushima

Curion's technology, which could process super clean water, was critical for the Fukushima cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. They were the "only game in town" to establish a large-scale engineering system that removed 99% of the radiation from the Fukushima plant after the tsunami and hydrogen explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Broader Views on Nuclear Energy

Josh Wolfe believes that [[the potential of nuclear energy as a renewable resource | nuclear energy]] is the only solution for large-scale, zero-carbon, or very low-carbon base load power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. He notes the development of portable microreactors and larger plants, but observes that the sector has somewhat stagnated in the US compared to countries like China, which has projects like the Bill Gates-funded traveling wave reactor that can repurpose waste as fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

He advocates for rebranding nuclear energy to change public perception, suggesting "elemental power" to connect it with elements of the sun (solar), wind (wind), and earth (uranium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Dispelling Nuclear Fears

Wolfe argues that the dangers and downsides of nuclear energy are "completely overstated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>:
*   **Chernobyl**: The disaster was due to an "outdated" containment structure, and modern facilities could have avoided the 4,000 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Fukushima**: While horrible, it's "very hard to actually attribute any direct deaths" to the Fukushima disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Dual-Use Argument**: The idea that nuclear power plants can easily be converted into weaponry is "basically bs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. It would take years to extract plutonium from an energy reactor to create a weapon, and finding enriched uranium is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

The US is "pathetically behind" in nuclear energy compared to countries like Sweden and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Wolfe believes that a new generation will eventually embrace nuclear as a necessary counter to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

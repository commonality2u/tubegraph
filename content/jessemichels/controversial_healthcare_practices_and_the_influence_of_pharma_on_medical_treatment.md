The modern healthcare system, particularly in the United States, faces significant criticism regarding its structure, pricing, and the influence of pharmaceutical companies on medical practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Figures like [[Martin Shkreli on pharmaceutical pricing and regulatory capture | Martin Shkreli]] have become emblematic of these issues, though their actions are often a symptom of deeper systemic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Pharmaceutical Pricing and Regulatory Capture

A major point of contention is the practice of drug pricing, which can lead to "pure rent seeking and regulatory capture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This behavior is described as "rampant in big pharma and American corporations" but often goes unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### The Daraprim Case
In 2015, Martin Shkreli's company acquired Daraprim, a drug used to treat AIDS-induced toxoplasmosis, and dramatically increased its price from $13.50 to over $700 per pill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This price hike was criticized for not driving genuine medical research and development (R&D) nor reflecting the remarkably low cost of Daraprim's production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Despite the controversy, Shkreli stated that his company made the drug accessible to those who couldn't afford the high price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> and that no patient went without Daraprim due to his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. He also noted that Daraprim is not the sole treatment for toxoplasmosis; a common antibiotic, Bactrim, works as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. His decision was based on the belief that doctors might not be aware of equally effective, cheaper alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.

Shkreli's profiteering scheme was "entirely legal and mundane," and he was ultimately jailed for securities fraud, not for the Daraprim price increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He had previously raised drug prices six other times without attracting media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

### Other Examples of Price Hikes
The practice of raising drug prices is not isolated to individuals. Abbvie (formerly Abbott), a large pharmaceutical company, dramatically increased the price of the HIV drug Norvir overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>. This is common practice, especially for older drugs grandfathered in after the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) act of 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. These drugs often remain on pharmaceutical companies' books with outdated, low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. Companies may divest these underpriced drugs, allowing other capitalists to acquire them and "fix this price" to align with the cost of other life-saving medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>.

## Systemic Problems in Healthcare
The healthcare system is characterized as being "screwed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:46">[02:37:46]</a>, with the cost of healthcare as a percentage of GDP growing metronomically since 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:04">[01:31:04]</a>. This growth is attributed to the insatiable demand for healthcare, which unlike other goods, has infinite marginal utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>.

### The Flexner Report and Physician Influence
A significant historical factor in the modern healthcare system is the Flexner Report of 1908, commissioned by Rockefeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. Before this report, a third of U.S. doctors were osteopaths, homeopaths, or healers working with the body's electromagnetic field, practices that could not be easily scaled into big business or generate artificial scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. The Flexner Report contributed to the establishment of the FDA and the American Medical Association (AMA), which then limited who could become a doctor, thereby restricting supply and driving up healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>.

The critique extends to physicians themselves, with some arguing that a lot of the cost comes from the physician side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>. Doctors, who on average earn $350,000 a year in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>, are incentivized to provide more treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. The system is described as "sick care" rather than "health care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. Efforts like Obamacare's value-based care were intended to shift this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>.

### Unnecessary Prescriptions
Doctors sometimes prescribe expensive new drugs when cheaper, generic alternatives like Prozac or metformin would be equally effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. This behavior is attributed to doctors' desire to "gain experience with this drug" or pharma's efforts to "woo" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.

## Exploring Alternative Treatments
Beyond molecular biology, there are discussions about treating the body using its physics layer, specifically its electromagnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. However, such approaches often cannot be patented, limiting commercial incentive for research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>.

### Novocure's Tumor Treating Fields
Novocure, a company that was initially dismissed as a "scam," has developed a helmet that uses magnetic fields ("tumor treating fields") to treat brain and lung cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. Despite initial skepticism due to the lack of clear biological explanation, clinical results have "demonstrably good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>. This suggests an understanding gap in how cells communicate through voltage-gated ion channels and the bioelectric field, which may dictate morphology more fundamentally than DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.

### Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
Similarly, [[Critique of Modern Therapy and SelfHelp | transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) has shown promise for depression and other central nervous system disorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. The appeal of these magnetic field therapies lies in their low toxicity and high safety profile, aligning with the medical principle of "do no harm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.

### Ketamine for Depression
Another heterodox treatment for depression, intranasal ketamine (Spravato), has received FDA approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. Despite its effectiveness, which makes Prozac "look like a waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>, its "unusual situation" creates access problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58">[01:09:58]</a>. Pharmaceutical companies often "screw on a couple atoms" to existing unpatentable drugs like ketamine to create new patentable versions, ensuring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

## Debates on Disease Origin and Treatment
The origin of COVID-19 and the historical approach to HIV treatment are also points of contention.

### COVID-19 Origin
The debate surrounding the origin of COVID-19, specifically whether it was "man-made" or leaked from a lab, highlights a desire for accountability for funding and conducting gain-of-function research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Despite the proximity of the Wuhan lab to the wet market, it is argued that nature is generally more adept at generating such viruses than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. The argument for a lab leak often relies on deductive logic about the lack of wet market exposure in many cases and the lab's prior safety issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.

### HIV Treatment and Controversies
Historically, figures like Anthony Fauci are criticized for maintaining that HIV would "never be cured" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>, which is seen as being counter to an entrepreneurial or innovative approach to disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. This perspective clashes with the view that a final treatment for HIV is within "striking distance," potentially through technologies like CRISPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. There is a resistance to conspiracy theories about profit suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>, but an acknowledgement of "inertia" in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

The views of Peter Duesberg, who was marginalized by figures like Fauci, are cited. Duesberg argued that HIV would be recessive in the body and only tip into AIDS due to factors like AZT and recreational drug use (e.g., amyl nitrate and crystal meth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. Furthermore, the presence of an HIV gene splice in COVID is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>, raising concerns about potential long-term immune suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.

Ultimately, there's a need to accept a symbiotic relationship with nature and recognize that viruses and pathogens often "mirror" an individual's fundamental health, exposing existing weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>. The significant difference between those who died or experienced severe long COVID and those who didn't often correlated with their health status prior to infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

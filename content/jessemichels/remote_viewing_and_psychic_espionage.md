## Introduction
[[remote_viewing_and_psychic_spying | Remote viewing]] and psychic espionage involve attempts to gain information about distant or unseen targets through purported psychic abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. This phenomenon has been explored by both the United States and Russian governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.

## Government Programs and Operations
The United States government and intelligence community have engaged in programs to train spies and soldiers in what is vernacularly called psychic espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.

### Hal Puthoff's Role
[[Hal Puthoff]] is considered "The Godfather" of the [[cias_stargate_project_and_its_psychic_spy_program | CIA's remote viewing program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. He has shared stories, such as one where participants were placed at the bottom of the ocean in a submarine and could still [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_spying | remote view]] things from afar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

### Specific Instances
*   **Guantanamo Bay Experiment**: Luis Elizondo, while managing a UFO program and portions of Guantanamo Bay involving high-value detainees, decided to conduct an experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. A few individuals engaged in [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_spying | remote viewing]] protocols from a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) at the Pentagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>. Later, a major news media article detailed this detainee's experience, who reportedly perceived "five white figures over his bed shaking his bed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. Elizondo then called Hal Puthoff, suggesting they stop because the information was public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.
*   **DC Metro Prediction**: On another occasion, Elizondo told Hal Puthoff he had a "really bad feeling" that something would happen with the DC Metro within 90 days, smelling fire and smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a>. On the 89th day, a fatal fire occurred on the red line of the DC Metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

## Scientific and Philosophical Perspectives
Elizondo suggests there is a "very scientific explanation" for these phenomena, believing it to be a "vestigial capability" that humans have possessed for a long time as a species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>.

### Quantum Physics and Consciousness
He speculates that [[remote_viewing_and_parapsychology | remote viewing]] is likely based in quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>. Many believe it is tied to quantum entanglement, with human consciousness potentially being an actual quantum process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. This could explain the interpretation of time and the perception of future or past elements as if they are occurring in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. Roger Penrose also theorized that the brain might be a room-temperature quantum system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.

### Corroboration and Skepticism
*   **Jessica Utz**: A well-known statistician who, despite initial skepticism, concluded "there's something here" after reviewing declassified [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate program]] documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.
*   **Ray Hyman**: A skeptic who also examined the data from these programs and found it inexplicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>.
*   **Non-attenuation**: The phenomenon seems not to attenuate over space-time, as evidenced by experiments where [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_spying | remote viewing]] was successful even from the bottom of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.

### The Problem with "Paranormal"
Elizondo notes that society has stigmatized the word "paranormal," even though the prefix "para" means "above or beside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. He asserts that "everything in science by definition everything is Paranormal until it becomes normal," citing examples like cell phones, Wi-Fi, and the electromagnetic spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.

## Historical Context and Connections
### Werner von Braun and UFO Crash Retrievals
Werner von Braun, a "rocket genius" and one of the founders of the US Space Program, revealed to Uri Geller that he had held a piece of metal from a UFO that crashed on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:59">[02:55:59]</a>. Von Braun was involved in the early stages of [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate]] tangentially, meeting with Russell Targ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:34">[02:36:34]</a>.

### Project A119 and Carl Sagan
Carl Sagan was a secret consultant on Project A119, a top-secret Air Force project at Kirtland Air Force Base, which contemplated detonating a nuclear blast on the moon as a show of force against the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:56">[02:12:56]</a>. Sagan's early journals were also filled with passages about [[psychic_phenomena_and_ufos | UFOs]] and extraterrestrial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:02">[02:03:02]</a>.

## Implications and Future Outlook
The ability to access or understand these phenomena presents a significant challenge to humanity, as it could either bring people together or cause further division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. There is a concern about how this knowledge and potential technology would be shared, given human nature to seek advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>.

Elizondo believes that collective consciousness is maturing, with trust in government and media at an all-time low, leading people to seek more truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He feels that the time has come for humanity to have a collective conversation about the nature of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

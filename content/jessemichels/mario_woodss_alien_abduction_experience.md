Mario Woods, a former US Air Force Security responder, experienced an incident in November 1977 that he claims changed him forever. At 23 years old, while stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, he encountered a large spherical object, resulting in missing time, unexplained marks on his body, and his partner, Michael Johnson, falling into a catatonic state [00:00:31]. Woods was part of the Personnel Reliability Program for sensitive nuclear equipment and had no prior mental health history [02:55].

## The Initial Sighting
On the night of the incident, around 9:00 or 9:15 PM, Woods stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. The temperature was between 9 and 13 degrees Fahrenheit [00:05:54]. He noticed a light to his east at about a 30-degree angle, resembling a "mini moon" [00:06:10]. Initially, he thought it might be landing lights for B-52 bombers, which often flew low-level test runs across the prairies [00:06:21]. The light appeared 5 to 7 miles away and remained stationary without sound [00:07:15].

Woods, using a toggle switch, flashed the facility's lights at the object three times. The object responded by flashing back in the same sequence [00:09:05, 00:09:41]. He called his partner, Michael Johnson, to witness it, and when Woods repeated the flashing, the object responded again [00:11:05, 00:11:33]. After a third attempt, the object moved slightly north and westward, then disappeared after a fourth flash [00:12:41, 00:13:23].

## Responding to the Alarm
Around 12:15 AM, an alert phone rang, signaling a two-pronged alarm at November 5, a nearby Minute Man 2 missile site [01:15:00, 01:16:16]. Woods and Johnson quickly prepared their Ford F-150 pickup truck, gathered their equipment, and departed around 12:20-12:25 AM [01:16:11, 01:16:38]. The site was approximately 8.5 to 10 miles away [01:17:04].

During their drive, Woods observed a pulsating orange, yellow, and white glow coming from the direction of November 5 [01:17:57]. As they turned onto a dog-leg road leading to the site, they saw a massive spherical object, described as the "size of a Walmart building," hovering about 10 feet above the missile's blast door [01:19:14, 01:19:21]. The object had a "boiling" energy source around it, but no visible tail sections, port holes, thrusters, or wings [01:19:35].

## The Encounter
Upon pulling their truck up to the site, about 60 feet from the fence line, a blinding light, like a welder's flash, erupted, almost "blowing his eyeballs out" [02:22:28]. The atmosphere seemed to vacate, and Woods found himself unable to breathe [02:23:00]. He asked for relief and flashed his flashlight at the object, immediately feeling a sense of relief and being able to breathe again [02:24:07, 02:25:31]. Inside the truck, dust particles appeared to move in slow motion, like "glitter" [02:25:49].

His partner, Michael Johnson, remained unresponsive, "stuck or glued to that steering wheel" and "bathed in a blue white light," in a catatonic state [02:26:25, 02:26:29]. A black, vent-like sphere, described as six times the size of a beach ball, then shot rapidly around the truck before disappearing [02:27:11]. An overwhelming, ammonia-like stench permeated the vehicle, despite the windows being closed [02:28:18]. Woods experienced tunnel vision and a feeling of passing out [02:30:35].

As he was blacking out, he saw four beings gliding across the ground on his right side [02:31:08]. Three were smaller and wore uniforms, while one was a "chest and a head taller" and had a pulsating device on its chest [02:31:47, 02:31:58]. Woods felt intense fear and then went black [02:32:09, 02:32:23].

## Missing Time and Debriefing
Woods regained consciousness moments later, his weapon secured between his legs, and found himself in "total Blackness" [02:32:33, 02:32:46]. He was unable to locate November 5 due to the darkness, and Michael Johnson remained unresponsive [02:33:00, 02:33:17]. Woods discovered they were behind the New Lake Reservoir Dam, about 8.5 miles from November 5, a location he had never been to before [03:00:27, 03:00:42]. Their two-wheel-drive truck was positioned perfectly to drive out of the location, with no prior tracks [04:17:19, 04:31:34].

Wing Security Control eventually contacted Woods, and he realized he had experienced "missing time" [03:32:08, 03:37:32]. The alarm for November 5 went off at 12:15 AM, but his watch showed it was after 6:00 AM, indicating over five hours unaccounted for [03:08:12, 03:08:14, 03:38:08, 03:38:12]. Michael Johnson remained in a catatonic state and had to be physically removed from the truck by arriving security personnel [04:00:30, 04:00:37].

Woods was taken for extensive questioning at Ellsworth Air Force Base's operations facility [04:44:00]. He was debriefed by his commander, Colonel Ralph Spreaker, and members of the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), including Captain Jack Reed and a "new OSI guy" named Rick Dodie [04:52:00, 05:32:00, 05:39:00]. Woods omitted seeing the beings from his report to avoid losing his clearance and job [05:59:23].

After the debriefing, Woods was examined by flight surgeons [05:58:00]. They noted two burns on his body – above his right eye and on the back of his right hand – and took skin samples [06:03:04, 06:03:07]. They also strangely examined his gums and teeth [06:02:07]. Woods was never given a copy of his report and was made to sign a non-disclosure agreement, classifying the incident [06:08:08, 06:06:37].

## Aftermath and Lasting Effects
Mario Woods did not see Michael Johnson again for about 18 days [07:57:00]. When Johnson visited Woods's apartment, he was in a normal state but still reserved [07:11:00]. They both drew what they had seen, and their drawings of the craft and the black sphere were "exact same pictures" [07:11:56, 07:36:00]. Johnson recalled hearing "do not fear" telepathically and witnessing everything, but was unable to respond [07:11:53, 07:12:02]. After this meeting, Woods never saw Johnson again, and all attempts to locate him have been unsuccessful [07:12:12, 07:13:00, 07:32:00, 07:38:00].

Woods's experience had profound lasting effects:
*   **Physical Marks**: He still has two perfectly vertically aligned marks on his leg, a "couple centimeter" each, with a "little dimple" in the middle, which his doctor confirmed were not from any known life-saving event or injury [01:39:55, 01:40:04, 01:41:09].
*   **Health Issues**: He developed atrial fibrillation (AFib) after his first hypnotic regression and requires medication [01:51:01, 01:51:26, 01:51:30].
*   **Electromagnetic Effects**: He experienced power outages and flickering lights in his home, affecting every electrical component [01:54:11, 01:55:00]. His neighbor later reported seeing his backyard "lit up like a Hollywood set" at 4:00 AM the night of the power anomaly [01:58:46].
*   **Compulsive Interest**: He developed an intense interest in archaeology, pyramids, and ancient advanced technologies, feeling as if this knowledge was "installed" or "downloaded" into him [01:27:08, 01:27:17]. This led him to study theories from researchers like Christopher Dunn and Robert Schoch [01:28:01].
*   **Regression Sessions**: Woods underwent [[mario_woodss_hypnotic_regression_sessions | hypnotic regression sessions]] with Bob Upton and Yvonne Smith [01:23:55]. These sessions revealed he was inside the craft, felt his wrist being manipulated by a tall being, and experienced telepathic communication saying "do not fear" [01:24:09, 01:25:05, 01:25:38]. He described the inside of the craft as a "beehive" with multiple levels and small Grays [01:31:34]. He was held in a "triangular kind of beam" about four feet in the air [01:32:35]. The regression also revealed a room with old human artifacts, like a "museum," where he was told he could look out a round window but was too afraid [01:34:07, 01:35:10, 01:35:18].

## Broader Implications
Mario Woods believes that the phenomena surrounding [[alleged_extraterrestrial_encounters_and_abductions | alleged extraterrestrial encounters and abductions]] are deeply interested in nuclear weapons and energy, possibly gauging human intelligence on the splitting of the atom [01:17:30, 01:17:36]. He also notes the unusual "routine" response from his superiors, suggesting prior knowledge of such incidents at nuclear bases [01:16:10]. Woods estimates that at Ellsworth Air Force Base alone, "one out of every four" security policemen may have seen something in the night sky [02:20:23].

He posits that these beings might be advanced civilizations, possibly from other dimensions [01:20:00, 01:23:00], and that their technology far surpasses human understanding [01:38:00]. He agrees with the idea that some ancient megalithic architecture might have been "celestial ascent chambers" or "Stargates" [01:43:37, 01:44:00]. Woods hopes his testimony can bring understanding and reduce fear, as he believes the beings are not here to harm or conquer humanity [01:59:47, 02:00:03].

He notes that the phenomenon of encounters seems to run in families [02:36:00], and that partners in such incidents often disappear or suffer negative consequences, like Michael Johnson's disappearance or Terry Lovelace's partner Toby, who "never fully recovered" after their incident [02:45:00, 02:46:00]. Woods advocates for transparency and is willing to testify before Congress about his [[experiences and testimonies of military personnel on UFOs | experiences and testimonies of military personnel on UFOs]] [02:50:00]. He seeks to find Michael Johnson to corroborate his account [02:24:24].

Richard Dolan's research has significantly contributed to understanding the historical handling of UFO phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Cleaving of UFO Studies

Dolan's work highlights a historical "cleaving off" of the vital study of UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>:
*   **Public-facing studies** were relegated to Project Blue Book and managed by the Air Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Private and classified studies** were managed by Battelle Memorial Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This classified work fell under the Atomic Energy Commission, particularly after 1954, and was also influenced by the precursor McMahon Secrecy Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

This distinction explains why Battelle would be heavily involved in such classified work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Robert Sarbacher reportedly detailed his work on materials at the Battelle Memorial Institute to Whitley Strieber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Sarbacher described how electron microscopes revealed a "molecular grid" or "designed grid" within a very thin material, which contributed to its strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This understanding of materials has likely been extrapolated into military technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, contributing to [[research_on_ufo_materials_and_isotopes | research on UFO materials and isotopes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

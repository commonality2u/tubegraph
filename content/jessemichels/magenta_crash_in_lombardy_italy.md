## Overview
The [[the_magenta_ufo_crash_in_italy_and_its_historical_implications | Magenta crash in Lombardy, Italy]] is an alleged [[ufo_crash_retrieval | UFO crash]] that occurred prior to the formation of the CIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. According to David Grush, this incident involved a crash in Lombardy, Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Custody and Transfer
The initial custody of the alleged [[ufo_crash_retrieval | UFO]] was overseen by the OSS (Office of Strategic Services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. James Jesus Angleton, the OSS representative in Italy at the time, was involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

The sequence of events suggests:
1.  The [[the_magenta_ufo_crash_in_italy_and_its_historical_implications | Lombardy Magenta crash]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  [[mussolini_nazi_and_vatican_connections_with_ufos | Mussolini]] inquires with Hitler and the Nazis regarding its origin, leading to their collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
3.  The craft then goes to the Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
4.  There is a possibility of custody involvement by the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]], a detail also mentioned by Grush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
5.  Pope Pius XII and the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]] were reportedly involved in back-channeling the craft through the OSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
6.  Ultimately, the craft was transferred to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Post-Crash Analysis in the US
Upon arrival in the U.S., the alleged craft was reportedly worked on at Wright Airfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The urgency to acquire Nazi scientists was partly driven by the desire to secure individuals with deep knowledge of exotic flight principles and [[ufo_reverse_engineering_and_crash_retrievals | UFO stuff]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Hans Kammler, who managed the most covert VFA programs for the Nazis, subsequently made his way to the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This forms a consistent narrative concerning this [[ufo_crash_retrieval | early UFO crash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

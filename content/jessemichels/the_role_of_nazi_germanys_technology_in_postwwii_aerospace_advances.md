After World War II, there was a significant interest in and scavenging of advanced German technology by the Allied powers, particularly the Americans and Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:16">[04:14:16]</a>. This included purported [[advanced_military_technology | advanced military technology]] and anti-gravity programs, which some speculate influenced post-war aerospace developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>.

## Hans Kammler and the "Schott Works"
Hans Kammler was a high-ranking [[mussolini_nazi_and_vatican_connections_with_ufos | Nazi]] SS officer known for overseeing the construction of concentration camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:54">[17:28:54]</a>. Deeply committed to [[mussolini_nazi_and_vatican_connections_with_ufos | Nazi ideology]], Kammler became a trusted officer of Hitler in the final years of the Third Reich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:05">[17:37:05]</a>. By 1945, he had a secret plan to assassinate Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:01">[17:55:01]</a>. Albert Speer, a colleague, described Kammler as "a cold ruthless schemer, a Fanatic in pursuit of a goal and as carefully calculating as he was unscrupulous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:22">[18:02:22]</a>.

Kammler and his staff presided over the "blackest of black" Nazi secret weapons projects, known as "Schott Works," located in modern Czechoslovakia and Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:35">[18:13:35]</a>. These projects took the concept of *Wunderwaffen* (Wonder Weapons) to an advanced level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:20">[18:24:20]</a>. Kammler's *Kamab* was a special projects office for breakthrough technology, including control over V2 rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:06">[16:56:06]</a>. There are many who believe that flying saucer-shaped craft were also part of his mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

### Alleged Anti-Gravity Programs and Designers
Kammler recruited several individuals for his projects who were working on exotic propulsion and design:
*   **Rudolph Shriver** (German technician): Claimed to have worked on a disc-shaped craft in Prague that made its first test flight in February 1945, climbing to 40,000 feet in 3 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:14">[19:08:14]</a>.
*   **Victor Schauberger** (Naturalist and Forester): Held a philosophy that science should comprehend and copy nature, with ideas resembling what is now called free energy or zero-point energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:43">[19:24:43]</a>. Schauberger had designs for a flying saucer with an "impeller engine" and reportedly built devices that "purportedly took off," running air and water through at very high rotation speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:02">[19:48:02]</a>. After leaving his home in Austria abruptly in 1942 (the year Kammler's secret projects began), Schauberger wrote to his son that he was doing secret work in Czechoslovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>. His diary shows his travels to places mapped within "the Kammler Kingdom" of secret laboratories and underground facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:02">[20:31:02]</a>.
*   **Richard Miethe:** Also had designs for a flying saucer and worked in high-voltage physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:32">[20:56:32]</a>.

### The "Glocke" (Bell) Program
One of the "craziest rumors" surrounding Schott Works is the idea of "[[nazi_bell_program_and_its_implications | the Glocke]]" (the Bell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:38">[21:48:38]</a>. This device was rumored to produce torsion fields, creating time dilation effects inside the bell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. It was purportedly overseen by figures like Ernest Gross, head of the SS medical division, and Walter Gerlach, a prominent German physicist who explored gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:01">[22:15:01]</a>. Nick Cook, author of "The Hunt for Zero Point," learned about this story from Polish writer Igor Witkowski, who wrote about German secret weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:04">[22:42:04]</a>.

Cook visited the supposed site of the Bell's installation, deep in a mine in Walim (now in Poland) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:01">[23:17:01]</a>. He observed a hexagonal structure, believed to be evidence of a test rig for some kind of disc-shaped craft, and noted the secrecy of the installation with evidence of "very thick cabling" and "lots of electricity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:04">[23:33:04]</a>. Over time, Cook concluded it was likely one of several sites the Germans, particularly the SS, used to investigate [[ufos_and_nuclear_weaponry_connections_during_the_cold_war | nuclear technology]] beyond the known Heisenberg program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:23">[24:00:23]</a>. Witkowski referred to a related program called "Kronos," the Greek word for time, which further links it to temporal effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>.

## Allied Scavenging and Post-War Implications
At the end of World War II, Kammler was reportedly in negotiations with the Western Allies, offering his files on various technologies in exchange for his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. This suggests a direct transfer of classified information and possibly personnel.

Further evidence of Allied interest in Nazi technology comes from Paul Mellon, a founder of the CIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:09">[21:11:09]</a>. Mellon, along with Alan Dulles (who later became the third director of the CIA), was on a top-secret trip to Czechoslovakia at the end of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:11">[21:16:11]</a>. Mellon recounted seeing a "German flying disc" in a hangar, not the "cobbled together with six BMW jet engines" version, suggesting a more sophisticated design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. This directly indicates that the Allies encountered potentially [[advanced_military_technology | advanced military technology]] from Nazi Germany.

This captured technology may have contributed to the sudden, widespread interest in anti-gravity by American [[role_of_aerospace_and_defense_industry_in_uap_research | Aerospace and Defense Industry]] companies and academic institutions in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. A 1956 magazine article titled "The G Engines Are Coming" listed top aerospace companies expressing confidence in developing anti-gravity aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. Quotes from individuals like George S. Trimble of Martin Corporation's Research Institute for Advanced Study suggested human control of gravity could be achieved in "about the time it took to build the first atom bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. However, by the early 1960s, the industry went silent on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

A 1971 Australian [[the_role_of_intelligence_operations_in_postwwII_america | intelligence]] memo, cited by David Grusch, also points to a deep, yet hidden, American interest in anti-gravity research in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:07">[26:07:07]</a>. This memo lists the same top aerospace companies and prominent physicists, including Robert J. Oppenheimer, as being involved in [[secret_technological_arms_race_and_reverse_engineering_of_ufo_technology | secret technological arms race and reverse engineering of UFO technology]] and gravity research, often at the behest of the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>. Agnew Bahnsen, an industrialist obsessed with anti-gravity, even wrote a science fiction book, *The Stars Are Too High*, which involved rogue Nazi scientists captured and moved to America after the war, collaborating to build man-made flying saucers using anti-gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. This fictional account may reflect underlying realities or fears of the time regarding the integration of former Nazi scientists and their knowledge into American programs.

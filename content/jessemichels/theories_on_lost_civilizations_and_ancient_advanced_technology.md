From: [[jessemichels]] <br/> 

The conventional understanding of human history, particularly regarding ancient civilizations, is challenged by mounting evidence suggesting the existence of highly advanced societies that predated known historical timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This emerging perspective posits that our current civilization may be part of repeating cycles of rise and fall, with previous advanced societies possibly wiped out by catastrophic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.

## Evidence of Prior Civilizations

### Subterranean Structures
The Giza Plateau, known for its pyramids and the Sphinx, is believed to conceal an extensive network of rooms and cavities beneath the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Sonar and ground-penetrating radar readings have revealed massive voids with carved, non-natural objects underneath the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids, suggesting a connected subterranean area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

It is speculated that the Sphinx acts as a guardian for entrances to these underground areas, possibly housing an ancient library or "halls of Amenti" containing records from ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. There are three to four known entrances to these subterranean areas around the Sphinx, including one under its left paw and one on top of its head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Attempts to explore these voids in the 1990s were allegedly blocked by Egyptian authorities, who boarded up entrances and conducted misleading drills to suggest no voids existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Redating Ancient Structures
The Sphinx shows evidence of water erosion, indicating it was built during a period with a tropical climate, much earlier than the conventionally accepted date by the Egypt Ministry of Culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Robert Schoch and [[Graham Hancock's theories on ancient civilizations | Graham Hancock]] propose that the Sphinx may have originally been a lion, aligning with the Leo constellation during the vernal equinox shift around 10,500 BC, and was later recarved with a pharaonic headdress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The Great Pyramids of Giza also align with star constellations, such as the Queen's chamber facing Sirius and the King's chamber facing Orion, an alignment that occurred around 10,500 BC due to the precession of the equinoxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. This suggests these structures were built much earlier than conventional dating, potentially predating the Younger Dryas catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

Many ancient sites globally show signs of having been adopted and repurposed by later cultures, who often claimed to have built them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. This phenomenon creates confusion in archaeological dating, as evidence of later inhabitants is often mistaken for the original builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:02">[02:21:02]</a>.

### Megalithic Structures and Advanced Tools
Sites like Kev Kesi in Turkey feature giant basalt blocks with machine-like cuts and levels of sophistication considered bizarre for their supposed age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:27">[02:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:30">[02:37:30]</a>. The presence of "vitrification" or literal melting of stone surfaces, requiring temperatures exceeding 2,000 degrees Celsius, suggests exposure to extreme heat, possibly from plasma events or massive volcanic eruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:55">[02:23:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:03">[02:24:03]</a>. Similar burn marks are observed on the Colossi of Memnon in Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:45">[02:36:45]</a>.

The use of specific hard stones, like basalt and pink granite (high in silica quartz, used in modern watches), transported hundreds of miles away, indicates a sophisticated understanding of materials and their energetic properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>. The precise cuts, some sharp enough to cut a finger, and seamless symbolic carvings across multiple blocks at sites like Puma Punku and Kev Kesi, suggest an advanced technology beyond conventional historical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:45">[02:37:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:05">[02:38:05]</a>.

### Underground Cities in Turkey
Derinkuyu and Kaymakli are massive subterranean cities carved out of soft volcanic rock in southern Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>. Derinkuyu alone could house over 20,000 people across 30 levels, with air shafts, food storage, and multi-ton stones to seal off entrances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. A 5.5-mile tunnel connects Derinkuyu to Kaymakli, suggesting the inhabitants moved underground because it was unsafe to be above ground, possibly due to a "nuclear winter" or catastrophic climate event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. The lack of excavated material and tools suggests these cities are extremely old, possibly built over 10,000 years ago, before the Younger Dryas catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

### Sumerian Texts and the Flood Story
Ancient Sumerian texts, considered the oldest writings, describe a great deluge that wiped out a previous age and led to the re-emergence of civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:56">[01:44:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>. The Epic of Gilgamesh, translated by George Smith in 1875, contains a flood narrative strikingly similar to the biblical Noah story, suggesting it as the original source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>.

The Sumerian King List mentions the city of Shuruppak, from which the "Noah figure" (Utnapishtim/Ziusudra) came <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:16">[01:55:16]</a>. Shuruppak, once considered a myth, was discovered in 1931 with three distinct layers, Strata 1, 2, and 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:14">[02:06:14]</a>. Below the later strata (Strata 2, associated with Gilgamesh's time around 3,500-4,000 years ago), archaeologists found a 3-4 foot thick alluvial layer with no human activity, directly above the earliest stratum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:01">[02:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:05">[02:11:05]</a>. This layer is believed to be the result of a massive flood that sealed and buried the older city, which may be as old as 40,000 years, based on ice core sampling and alignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:49">[02:14:49]</a>.

## Advanced Knowledge and Technology

### Geodesy and Astronomical Alignments
Ancient civilizations had a precocious understanding of the cosmos, evident in their architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>. The science of geodesy involves creating structures in specific positions that align with cardinal points, Earth-Sun-Moon ratios, and star constellations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. The Great Pyramid of Giza and other sites like Eridu in ancient Sumer are built on the 30th parallel, a significant quadrant zone of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>.

Many ancient structures around the world are no longer perfectly aligned with cardinal points, suggesting a shift in the Earth's axis during volatile periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. The precise alignment of sites like GÃ¶bekli Tepe, believed to be an astronomical calendar tracking the "Great Year" (the 26,000-year cycle of the precession of the equinoxes), supports the idea of advanced astronomical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:03">[02:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a>.

### Symbolism as Language
Many [[ancient_structures and their potential connections to extraterrestrial technology | ancient structures]] from this suspected earlier civilization, such as the Great Pyramid of Giza and Puma Punku, lack written language or hieroglyphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:17">[02:32:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:25">[02:32:25]</a>. It is theorized that their language was symbolism, a way to preserve knowledge without misinterpretation by those not initiated as "adepts and sages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:47">[02:32:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:02">[02:33:02]</a>.

Symbols like the Sun Cross (also found on the Vatican), the pine cone (representing knowledge), and the "cup" or "chalice" (representing the passing of spiritual doctrine) are found globally, tracing back to sites in Eastern Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:47">[02:25:47]</a>. These symbols represent universal laws and divine knowledge, including the balance of harmony, the connection of everything, and the path to higher states of [[consciousness and advanced technology | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:26">[02:33:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:51">[02:33:51]</a>.

### Pyramids as Energy Generation Machines
The Great Pyramid of Giza and similar structures may have served as "ascension temples" or energy generation machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:03">[02:40:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:05">[02:40:05]</a>. Their construction using specific materials like granite (containing quartz) over subterranean aquifers suggests a function related to geometry and physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. It is thought that these structures harnessed Earth's toroidal energy field, creating a synergy with celestial bodies to facilitate higher states of consciousness and potentially unlock abilities like telekinesis or levitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:21">[02:53:21]</a>.

## Catastrophic Events and Civilizational Cycles

### Climate Volatility
The period around 10,500 BC was highly volatile for Earth, marked by the Older and Younger Dryas events, which transitioned the Earth from the Pleistocene to the Holocene epoch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. Ice core data from Antarctica and Greenland indicates massive carbon spikes and rapid temperature fluctuations during these periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>. For example, 14,500 years ago, temperatures rose to levels warmer than present day within a few hundred years, followed by an immediate, drastic drop colder than the Ice Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:19">[01:32:19]</a>.

### Coronal Mass Ejections (CME)
These rapid climatic shifts are theorized to be caused by massive Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) events from the sun, far more powerful than anything recorded in modern human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>. A large CME could melt glaciers instantly, releasing vast amounts of freshwater into oceans, disrupting global currents like the Gulf Stream, and causing rapid cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>. Evidence of widespread vitrification and plasma discharges at various ancient sites globally supports the CME theory over localized impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:15">[01:36:15]</a>.

[[Mars and ancient civilization theories | Mars]] is presented as a prime example of planetary destruction by a CME event, which could have stripped its atmosphere and caused water to evaporate, leaving behind a barren landscape with scarring like the Valles Marineris, consistent with plasma effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

### The Binary Star Companion Theory
The consistent 12,000-12,500 year cycle of these catastrophes is linked to the "Great Year" (approximately 25,000-26,000 years), which is explained by the existence of a binary star companion to our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. Pioneer 10 and 11 probes, launched in the 1970s, allegedly detected a "dead star" beyond the Kuiper Belt, exerting a gravitational "equal pull" on our entire solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:53">[01:54:53]</a>. This dead star's elliptical orbit brings it closest to our sun every 12,500 years (perihelion), causing our sun to emit massive energetic explosions (CMEs) due to gravitational influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

This phenomenon is believed to be the underlying reason for the "[[Speculations on consciousness and its connection to ancient legends | Yuga Cycles]]" described in ancient Indian texts, which track the rise and fall of civilizations based on these ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. The fact that approximately 80% of all known stars are binary or trinary systems supports the plausibility of our sun having a companion star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>.

## Concealed Knowledge and Modern Implications

### Suppression of Information
It is alleged that [[historical_and_ongoing_research_into_UFO_phenomena_and_advanced_technologies | NASA]] and other authorities deliberately suppressed information about the binary star companion and its impact on civilizational cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. The data from Pioneer 10 and 11, specifically regarding the "dead star" and a large planet (Planet 9 or 10) beyond the Kuiper Belt, was reportedly "scrubbed" from the internet, and astronomers who investigated it, Robert Harrington and Thomas Van Flandern, mysteriously died of throat cancer in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:16">[01:56:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>. This cover-up is theorized to prevent widespread panic and societal collapse, maintaining control over the narrative of inevitable civilizational resets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20">[01:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>.

### Preserved Wisdom and Consciousness
The survival of [[lost_civilizations and shared global traditions | ancient structures]] built with the hardest stones and their embedded symbolism suggests they were left as "memory capsules" to preserve knowledge for future generations, especially given that organic matter and digital records would not survive catastrophes over thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. This knowledge pertains to the Earth's vital role in a spiritual system, the balance and harmony of existence, and the potential for humanity to reach higher states of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:47">[02:40:47]</a>.

The idea is that human consciousness is not localized but part of a greater, interconnected cosmic awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:28">[02:56:28]</a>. Ancient mystery rituals, including temporary near-death experiences, allowed individuals to experience "noesis" (primordial soul self-awareness) and return with knowledge of their own immortality, reinforcing the belief that energy cannot be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:43">[02:58:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:06">[03:00:06]</a>.

### Future Outlook and New Discoveries
There is a growing belief that humanity is at a "tipping point" where the current, flawed historical narrative, built on a "foundation of sand," is collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:24">[03:05:24]</a>. New dating technologies and ongoing [[exploration_and_lost_civilizations | exploration]] of ancient sites promise to unveil definitive evidence that could dramatically shift our understanding of human origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:01">[03:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:20">[03:07:20]</a>. A forthcoming documentary project is aiming to consolidate this evidence, including potential dating breakthroughs from sites in Turkey, Peru, Bolivia, and Minorca, Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:10">[03:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:51">[03:06:51]</a>.

This paradigm shift will require an open-minded, objective approach to science, moving beyond dogma and embracing the possibility that ancient civilizations had a highly advanced, albeit different, path of development, focused on organic connection to the Earth and unlocking innate human abilities rather than purely technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:02">[02:53:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:06">[03:14:06]</a>.

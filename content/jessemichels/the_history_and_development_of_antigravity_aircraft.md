The concept of [[antigravity_research_and_technology | antigravity aircraft]] has been a subject of intense, often secretive, research and speculation within aerospace and scientific communities for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This field explores propulsion systems that could counteract gravity, potentially leading to [[ufo_propulsion_and_exotic_physics | man-made UFOs]] or advanced flight capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Early Aerospace Interest (1950s)

In 1956, a magazine article titled "The G Engines Are Coming" detailed that top aerospace companies of the day, including Lear, Convair, Bell, and the Martin Corporation, expressed confidence in developing [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity aircraft]] within several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. George S. Trimble, VP of Martin Corporation's Research Institute for Advanced Study (RAAS), claimed that human control of gravity could be achieved in about the same time it took to build the first atom bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. However, by the early 1960s, these "G engines" or weightless craft did not materialize, and the industry reportedly went silent on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Nick Cook's Investigation and "The Hunt for Zero Point"

Nick Cook, former aviation editor for Jane's Defence Weekly, first encountered this historical interest in 1994 when he found a photocopy of the 1956 "G Engines" article on his desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Intrigued, Cook attempted to interview George Trimble, who initially seemed open but later became "scared" and refused to speak, advising Cook to drop his interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This sudden change fueled Cook's pursuit, leading him to write "The Hunt for Zero Point," a comprehensive documentation of aerospace's deep inquiries into [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Cook, known for his work uncovering [[secret_aerospace_programs_and_undisclosed_aircraft | classified stealth and supersonic aircraft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, approaches the topic as a journalist, seeking to understand the potential "new [[physics_and_exotic_propulsion_technologies | physics]]" required for such breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:01]</a>.

## Theoretical Physics and Gravity Research

The 1950s saw a "tremendous flurry of activity" in gravity research, as [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity]] sought to gain respectability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
*   **Gravitons** The 1956 "G Engines" article mentions "G particles" or gravitons, theoretically mediating gravity similar to how photons mediate electromagnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>. Researchers Stanley Deser and Richard Arnowitt at Princeton were actively involved in this research, winning a Gravity Research Foundation essay contest in 1954 for their paper on theoretical gravitons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:12:00">[25:12:00]</a>.
*   **Conferences and Institutes** Lewis Whitten, a mathematician, noted that [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity]] was "in the wind" during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>. Agu Babson, an industrialist obsessed with [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity]], patronized the Institute for Field Physics at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>. In 1957, Babson hosted the Chapel Hill conference, bringing together top physicists like John Wheeler, Richard Feynman, and Freeman Dyson to discuss gravity within the Einsteinian paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>. This conference, sponsored by Wright Airfield (a hub for [[ufo_physics_and_advanced_technologies | UFO rumors]] with its own theoretical [[physics_and_antigravity_research_in_aerospace_companies | physics]] anti-gravity division) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>, marked the beginning of the "Golden Age of relativity" (1957-1970) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:00">[28:27:00]</a>. Lewis Whitten also worked on gravity research for Wright Airfield at George Trimble's Research Institute for Advanced Study at Martin Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>.

## Wartime Origins and German Programs

The search for [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity]] leads back to World War II, with sightings of "Foo Fighters" (seemingly controlled ball lightning) by Allied and Axis fighter pilots between 1942 and 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. In 1946, "Swedish ghost rockets" appeared, prompting General James Doolittle to investigate seemingly modified V2 rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.

### SS General Hans Kammler and "Scoda Works"
Circumstantial evidence suggests a secret German weapons program under SS Officer Hans Kammler, known as "Scoda Works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. Kammler, who oversaw breakthrough technologies like the V2 rocket, reportedly managed projects involving flying saucer-shaped craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.
*   **Rudolph Schriever** Kammler recruited German technician Rudolph Schriever, who claimed to have worked on a disc-shaped craft in Prague that made its first test flight in February 1945, climbing to 40,000 feet in three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.
*   **Victor Schauberger** Naturalist Victor Schauberger, known for his ideas resembling free energy or zero-point energy, also had diagrams and designs for a flying saucer with an "impeller engine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>. His diary entries indicate he was in Jonet, Czechoslovakia, working on secret projects within Kammler's "kingdom" of laboratories and underground facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:12]</a>.
*   **Richard Miethe** Physicist Richard Miethe, who worked in high-voltage [[physics_and_antigravity_research_in_aerospace_companies | physics]], also had designs for a flying saucer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.
*   **CIA Accounts** John Warner IV recounts his grandfather, Paul Mellon (a CIA founder), seeing a German flying disc in a hangar in Czechoslovakia at the end of WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:11]</a>.
*   **Die Glocke (The Bell)** A controversial rumor surrounding Scoda Works is "Die Glocke" (The Bell), a device purportedly creating torsion fields, time dilation effects, and [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravitational]] effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. While Nick Cook attributes this story to Polish writer Igor Witkowski, he acknowledges visiting the supposed installation site in Walenberg, Poland, which showed evidence of a secret, high-electrical installation, possibly related to nuclear weapon research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:17]</a>. Witkowski suggested its name was "Kronos," the Greek god of time, hinting at its purported temporal effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

## Post-War US Interest and Secrecy

### Twining Memo
In 1947, General Nathan Twining, head of the Air Material Command, wrote the "Twining memo," stating that the wave of [[historical_accounts_of_ufos | UFO sightings]] that summer were "something real and not visionary or fictitious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. He described the objects as metallic discs, lacking jet trails or propulsion sounds, and exhibiting "extreme rates of climb [and] maneuverability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. Crucially, the postscript of the memo noted that "it is within our present knowledge to build these sorts of crafts" with a range exceeding the U2 spy plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

### Australian Intelligence Memo
A 1971 Australian intelligence memo by Harry Turner, head of the Australian Joint Intelligence Organization's nuclear division, pointed to a deep and hidden American interest in [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity]] in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:05]</a>. This memo, which followed bizarre [[historical_accounts_of_ufos | UFO encounters]] at Australian nuclear testing facilities, listed the same top aerospace companies (Martin Corporation, Lear, Convair, Bell) and prominent physicists (including Robert J. Oppenheimer) as being actively involved in [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>. It also named six academic institutions, such as Princeton and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, as centers for gravity research at the behest of the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>. The memo suggested that public-facing programs like Project Blue Book were used to systematically downplay and marginalize the topic because a "real project" was being developed in secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>.

## Key Researchers and Experimental Efforts

### Thomas Townsend Brown (T.T. Brown)
Thomas Townsend Brown, a mid-century engineer and inventor, is a controversial figure whose work has been linked to [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:57:00">[30:57:00]</a>.
*   **Electrogravitics and the B-2 Bomber** Brown's work centered on electrostatics, which can reduce radar signature and drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:34:00">[31:34:00]</a>. Papers on "electrogravitics" (a term solely used for Brown's work at the time) and its aviation implications were published by Northrop in 1968, three months after Brown shut down his company, Guidance Technologies, despite reporting "no results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>. This suggests his intellectual property might have been covertly transferred to Northrop, which shared the same investor, Floyd Odom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>. Two decades later, Aviation Weekly reported that Northrop's B-2 stealth bomber used an "electrokinetic effect" in its wings, producing a "Byfield Brown effect," with the B-2 surfing its own electrostatic wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>. Some speculate the "B2" name refers to "Byfield Brown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>. Bill Gunston, a respected aerospace editor, noted that the B-2's performance data did not add up given its engine power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13:00">[35:13:00]</a>.
*   **Philadelphia Experiment** Brown was reportedly involved in the "Philadelphia Experiment," a supposed 1943 Navy experiment where the USS Eldridge became invisible and teleported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:39:00">[37:39:00]</a>. While much of the lore is considered "quackery," the experiment likely involved creating a high-voltage envelope to scramble the ship's magnetic signature, making it undetectable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:10:00">[38:10:10]</a>. Brown, stationed in Norfolk, Virginia at the time, later confirmed the experiment happened but that its events were "greatly exaggerated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>. An FBI file from 1943 noted Brown "knew more about radar than anyone in the Navy at the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>.

### Ning Li
Ning Li was a Chinese-American physicist at the University of Alabama Huntsville who developed a theory of gravity manipulation involving the alignment of ion rotation in a Bose-Einstein condensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:08:00">[41:08:00]</a>. She claimed to achieve "paradigm-shifting results" by suspending test masses above a spinning superconductor, reporting weight loss of 0.5% to 2.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:26:00">[41:26:00]</a>. This claim, if true, would unify electromagnetism and gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:59:00">[41:59:00]</a>. Lee left the university to start AC gravity LLC, winning a DOD contract and subsequently going "off grid" for 20 years, becoming highly secretive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>. Her former physics chair, Larry Smalley, joined her company and was later listed on NASA patents for asymmetric capacitors, a core instrument in Brown's experiments, suggesting a possible connection to Brown's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46:00">[42:46:00]</a>.

### Other Inventors and Scientists
Cook's research also chronicled other figures reporting [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravitational effects]], including Victor Schauberger, Thomas Townsend Brown, John Hutchison, and Eugene Podkletnov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a>. Yevi Podkletnov, a Russian scientist, reported a weight loss effect in objects suspended above rapidly rotating superconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:00">[39:51:00]</a>, although NASA's attempts to replicate it were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:05:00">[40:05:05]</a>. John Hutchison, a Canadian inventor, received DOD funding for anti-gravitational experiments involving "crazy equipment," which reportedly showed objects flying across the room "off camera" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a>. There's a question whether these effects were due to equipment or psychokinetic influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>.

## [[secret_aerospace_programs_and_undisclosed_aircraft | Secret Aerospace Programs]] and Disclosure

The Aerospace and defense industry has shown a willingness to explore "heretical science" far beyond academia, even funding psychic spying programs like remote viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:43:00">[54:43:00]</a>. Companies are always looking for "possible advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:22:00">[54:22:00]</a>.

### Skunk Works
Ben Rich, former director of Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works (responsible for [[secret_aerospace_programs_and_undisclosed_aircraft | stealth aircraft]] like the F-117), made enigmatic statements about Skunk Works possessing technology to "take ET home" and "travel across various star systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:11:00">[49:11:00]</a>. When asked how, he replied, "How does ESP work? All points in space and time are connected. That's how it works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:28:00">[49:28:00]</a>. On his deathbed, Rich allegedly stated, "We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in Black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>. Rich considered burying stealth technology rather than revealing it, akin to the secrecy surrounding bomb physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:56:00">[50:56:00]</a>.

### Lockheed Aurora
The "Aurora" is a mythical hypersonic aircraft rumored to replace the SR-71 Blackbird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>. Bill Sweetman, Cook's colleague, pieced together clues for its existence, including unattributable sonic booms detected by the US Geological Survey in California tracking toward Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:52:00">[58:52:00]</a>, and a sighting by Royal Observer Corps member Chris Gibson of a "Dart-like Black Arrow shaped thing" escorted by F-111s over the North Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:56:00">[59:56:00]</a>. Bill believed the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program (x-30), intended to develop a plane flying from the US to Asia in 45 minutes, was a cover program for Aurora, channeling technologies like scramjets and new materials into a classified program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. UK Ministry of Defence documents from the early 1990s also discussed hypersonic craft with "novel propulsion" from the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. General George Mullner, former head of US Air Force Research and Development, suggested Aurora filled a gap between the SR-71's retirement and the deployment of new Keyhole satellites, implying it was a "deployable prototype" used for temporary utility before being retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

### Astra
During an interview at Skunk Works, Nick Cook observed an organizational chart displaying an unacknowledged aircraft called "Astra" at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>. His escort quickly "bundled" him out of the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>. Later, a Skunk Works boss confirmed awareness of the incident and stated Astra "hasn't flown yet," but would "make an appearance sometime soon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. Cook later realized his visit was on April Fool's Day, suggesting it might have been a deliberate "trick" or "game" to get him to write about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.

## Implications and Future

The continued secrecy and compartmentalization of advanced [[antigravity_research_and_technology | anti-gravity research]] raise concerns about stagnation and potential disadvantages compared to nationalized efforts in countries like Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>. However, there's also the perspective that such technologies could be "dual use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a>, with the potential to enable interstellar travel and even "jump timelines" by manipulating gravity and spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

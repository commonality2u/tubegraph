The concepts of [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_spying | remote viewing]] and parapsychology, which involve alleged psychic abilities, have been areas of both fascination and intense skepticism, particularly concerning their potential government applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Hal Puthoff's Involvement

Hal Puthoff, an electrical engineer and laser physicist, has a significant background in sensitive government programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He previously worked for the NSA and CIA and served as a senior advisor to the official government UFO investigation program, AATIP, which operated from 2007 to 2012 out of Bigelow Aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Crucially, Puthoff also founded and ran the CIA's [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | psychic spy program]] known as [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate]] at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Stargate Program

The [[stargate_program_and_psychic_spying | Stargate program]] was a government initiative focused on psychic spying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It ran from 1972 to 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a> and involved a 20-year, 20-million-dollar investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. The program's creation was spurred by the CIA learning that the Russians were spending millions on similar research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

The program explored various phenomena, including [[parapsychology_and_mind_over_matter_experiments | psychokinesis]] and extrasensory perception (ESP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. Early on, Puthoff investigated claims of a psychic named Ingo Swann, who had allegedly made thermistors' temperatures go up and down from across a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. Puthoff invited Swann to SRI, where Swann demonstrably affected a "cork detector"—a quantum chip shielded against all known external forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. Swann not only stopped the detector's oscillation but also accurately described its internal workings without prior knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>. This led to the expansion of [[remote_viewing_and_its_successes | remote viewing]] capabilities to target super-secret facilities and access hidden project titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.

Regarding the mechanisms of [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_espionage | remote viewing]], Puthoff confirmed that it is not dependent on electromagnetic brain waves, as some of the best results were obtained with [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_espionage | remote viewers]] in submarines at the bottom of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. There is a possibility that a "quantum sensor" in the brain could be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.

### Financial Applications

The potential for [[remote_viewing_and_its_successes | remote viewing]] to influence the stock market was also explored. A hedge fund attempt using [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_espionage | remote viewing]] on silver futures generated approximately $260,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>. Despite the success, the effort was halted due to Puthoff's exhaustion from training army intelligence officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>. Puthoff maintains that with proper application, it could be profitable, citing a 70/30 success rate instead of 50/50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.

## Parapsychology and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs)

There appears to be significant overlap between individuals interested in parapsychology and those interested in UAPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. Jacquefully and Eric Davis published a paper outlining six levels of UAP phenomena, ranging from "nuts and bolts" physical sightings at the bottom to "spiritual or metaphysical aspects" at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Some UAP observations, like cattle mutilations, defy conventional explanation and force a consideration of broader phenomena, suggesting a deliberate action by the UAPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>. Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, purchased by Robert Bigelow (founder of Bigelow Aerospace), is a notable location where UAP sightings, cattle mutilations, and anomalous electromagnetic effects have been reported, prompting further scientific inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

## Scientific Reconciliation and the Nature of Reality

Puthoff actively attempts to reconcile seemingly [[parapsychology_and_mind_over_matter_experiments | parapsychology and mind over matter experiments]] with established physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. One approach involves the idea of promoting what are typically considered constants (like the gravitational constant) into field variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. If a constant is actually a function of a larger space of possibilities, and that function becomes quantum mechanical, it would need to be treated quantum mechanically, implying significant consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

Hal Puthoff suggests that if we could manipulate variables in Einstein's equations for general relativity as we do in Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism, certain UAP phenomena might be explained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. He has published research on a "polarizable vacuum approach," which can replicate tests of general relativity by manipulating the vacuum's dielectric constant values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

The Aharonov-Bohm effect is cited as an analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. This effect demonstrates that an electron beam can detect the presence of an electromagnetic four-potential even when electric and magnetic fields are zero due to insulation, indicating that potentials, not just fields, can be influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. Puthoff has two patents and has started a company focused on dealing solely with vector and scalar potentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. This concept aligns with the idea of "advanced science being indistinguishable from magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

Eric Weinstein's "Geometric Unity" theory, which postulates extra spatial and temporal dimensions, could potentially explain UAP observations like apparent faster-than-light travel through "temporal dimension hacking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. If this theory were true, understanding how to "hack extra temporal dimensions" would be a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

Ultimately, the existence of parapsychological phenomena suggests that either new physics is at play (e.g., new effects like Aharonov-Bohm not yet fully understood) or that reality is not purely material, implying angels, demons, or spirits that do not conform to current scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.

## Stigma and Secrecy

The U.S. government has a protocol for wielding stigma as a tool to keep programs secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. This includes using language to discourage scientific investigation into areas of security concern and even engaging in "image cheapening," as seen in the FBI's actions against Jean Seberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>. This manufactured stigma makes it difficult for scientists to investigate phenomena like UFOs or [[parapsychology_and_mind_over_matter_experiments | parapsychology]] without fear of ridicule or career damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

Eric Weinstein admits his own strong negative reaction to the topic of UFOs and UAPs, which he attributes to years of being conditioned by stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. He acknowledges that if [[remote_viewing_and_psychic_espionage | remote viewing]] and related phenomena were demonstrably profitable, skeptics could be convinced through the "number go up" argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

The shift in government discourse regarding UFOs—from Project Blue Book's dismissal to recent Pentagon reports acknowledging UAPs—suggests either historical deception or a deliberate campaign to manage public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. The change in 1952, following UFO sightings in Washington D.C. and the first H-bomb detonation, led to a systematic downplaying of the phenomena due to fears of mass hysteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Some believe this secrecy was an attempt to hide a deeper understanding of fundamental physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## What is Parapsychology?
[[Remote viewing and parapsychology | Parapsychology]] is described as a "fringy field of physics" that investigates [[nonphysical phenomena and psychokinesis | mind over matter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It explores functions of the mind that cannot be explained purely by brain processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, challenging the conventional understanding that consciousness is limited by the five senses and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Notable Researchers and Institutions

### Paul Smith and the Stargate Project
Paul Smith is an individual who worked in the CIA's [[Mind Control and Remote Viewing Programs | Stargate Project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This program was a [[Mind Control and Remote Viewing Programs | psychic spy program]] that operated from 1972 to 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Smith and others served as [[Mind Control and Remote Viewing Programs | remote viewers]], capable of discerning details of distant objects or locations using only their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The [[Mind Control and Remote Viewing Programs | Stargate Project]] was declassified in 2017, and its files are publicly available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

### Herb Metz and the PEAR Lab
Herb Metz is a [[Remote viewing and parapsychology | parapsychologist]] affiliated with Princeton University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He spent over a decade at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, which was founded in 1979 by plasma physicist Bob Jahn, then Dean of the engineering school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The PEAR lab focused on experiments involving [[nonphysical phenomena and psychokinesis | Random Event Generators (REGs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Remote Viewing

### How Remote Viewing Works
[[Remote viewing and parapsychology | Remote viewing]] is a skill that can be trained, involving the organization of perceptual experiences and consciousness to access and perceive details of locations, persons, or things without direct access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This allows individuals to "remote view a target without even knowing what the target is," even if it's on the other side of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

A core principle in training for [[Remote viewing and parapsychology | remote viewing]] is learning to recognize subtle "signals" from the target while distinguishing them from "mental noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The "left brain" often tries to interpret or solve the problem, leading to false impressions (e.g., mistaking the Eiffel Tower for a bridge due to crisscrossing metal girders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. A "zen component" is involved, requiring focus on the process rather than the outcome, and learning not to care about success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Origins of Remote Viewing
The concept of [[Remote viewing and parapsychology | remote viewing]] as a rigorous protocol began with laser physicist Hal Putoff in 1972, working with New York City-based [[Psychic Phenomena and UFOs | psychic]] Ingo Swann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Swann, who had experienced [[Neardeath experiences and outofbody phenomena | out-of-body experiences]] since childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, believed this ability could be honed. His accurate [[Remote viewing and parapsychology | remote viewing]] of a highly shielded cork detector's readouts drew the attention of high-ranking defense department officials, leading to the launch of the [[Mind Control and Remote Viewing Programs | Stargate Project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Documented Successes
The [[Mind Control and Remote Viewing Programs | Stargate Project]] had several notable successes:
*   **Typhoon Submarine** Joe McMoneagle, also known as "remote viewer number one," described in vivid detail a novel Russian nuclear submarine eight months before it was publicly revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. He accurately described the submarine's unique feature of having ballistic missile tubes in front of the sail, which was previously unheard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Lost TU-22 Spy Plane** In 1979, Rosemary Smith identified the crash location of a downed TU-22 spy plane in Zaire within a three-mile radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This plane contained highly sensitive Russian cryptic equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. President Jimmy Carter recalled being shocked when a [[Psychic Phenomena and UFOs | psychic medium]] accurately channeled the plane's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **USS Stark Incident** In 1987, during the Iran-Iraq War, Paul Smith [[Remote viewing and parapsychology | remote viewed]] an "American destroyer-like" vessel being hit by two "little cylinders with stubby wings" (Exocet missiles) fired by an aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. He described the vessel as "full of smoke and flames" and "all bent and crumpled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Days later, the USS Stark was hit by Iraqi Exocet missiles, exactly as he described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Random Event Generators (REGs)

### The PEAR Lab Experiments
[[nonphysical phenomena and psychokinesis | Random Event Generators (REGs)]] are devices that use a quantum process to produce random output, typically one of two different states, similar to a coin toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The PEAR lab experiments demonstrated that an observer present could have a statistically significant "skewing effect" on the REG's output based on their intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For instance, when subjects intended to produce more ones, the graph of the output would consistently go up, and when they intended more zeros, it would go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### The Experimenter Effect
A significant aspect of REG experiments is the "experimenter effect," where the beliefs or skepticism of the experimenter can influence the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Research by [[Remote viewing and parapsychology | parapsychologist]] Gertrude Schmeidler in the 1950s-70s found that "sheep" (those who believe in [[Psychic Phenomena and UFOs | psychic phenomenon]]) consistently achieved better effects than "goats" (skeptics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This suggests that a priori skepticism can affect the experiment's outcome, challenging conventional scientific epistemology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## Consciousness and the Physicalist Model
These experiments challenge the "physicalist" model of consciousness, which posits that consciousness is solely a product of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The ability to perceive things at a distance, where it shouldn't be possible if physicalism is true, suggests a "transmission concept of consciousness" is more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The "binding problem of consciousness" (how sensory inputs become a unified experience) is still unsolved in mainstream science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

It is believed that future tools, such as advanced computational processes and interventions like transcranial magnetic stimulation, could allow researchers to better separate and recombine mind and brain functions to understand their interaction and potentially enhance abilities to affect devices like REGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. There is an optimistic outlook that neuroscience will inevitably find functions of mind that cannot be purely described by brain processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook
Despite compelling evidence, [[Remote viewing and parapsychology | parapsychology]] faces challenges in being accepted by the mainstream scientific community because its findings cannot be easily explained within the current physicalist paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The current scientific worldview tends to suppress competing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

[[Remote viewing and parapsychology | Parapsychology]] has received significantly less funding compared to conventional physics; for example, less than $30 million has been spent globally on [[Remote viewing and parapsychology | parapsychology]] in the last 100 years, which is less than the cost of a single particle accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. While issues with repeatability and instrumentalizing [[Remote viewing and parapsychology | parapsychology]] into predictable technology exist, its potential dramatic implications for science and daily life warrant more investigation and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

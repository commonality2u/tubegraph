From: [[jessemichels]] <br/> 

The notion that humanity might be living in a [[Simulation theory and the nature of reality|simulation]] has become a prevalent idea, often attributed to [[Philosophical and Existential Views on Life and Health|postmodern nihilism]] and the absurdity of modern life, where society feels purposeless and driven by material gain and status games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This perspective suggests that while we may perceive reality as "fake and ephemeral," we continue to participate in it, paralyzed by a lack of faith in higher realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Origins of the Simulation Hypothesis

The idea of living in a "computer programmed reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, with clues revealed when variables change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, gained early traction through science fiction authors like Philip K. Dick and William Gibson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It received academic validation with Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom's 2012 book, *Superintelligence*, which hypothesized that we are literally living in a computer simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Bostrom's core thesis suggests that as technology advances to create virtual realities indistinguishable from our own, it's plausible that our reality is such a creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### The "RPG Version"

One "flavor" of [[Simulation theory and the nature of reality|simulation theory]] proposes an "RPG version," where individuals are not merely non-player characters (NPCs) but avatars of more expanded, fundamental, and primordial souls that voluntarily port into this "low-level reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This concept, akin to Plato's Myth of Er, suggests that these souls experience "anamnesis," forgetting their former primordial selves, but retain real agency within this world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This view is considered more life-affirming than a purely nihilistic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Evidence for a Designed Reality

Various phenomena in physics and nature are cited as potential evidence for a simulated or intelligently created reality.

### Finely Tuned Physical Constants

The laws of science contain fundamental numbers that appear to be "finely adjusted" to make the development of life possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Examples include:
*   The properties of water, such as ice being less dense than liquid water, preventing Earth from flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   Plank's constant or the strong nuclear force, which if slightly different, would drastically alter the formation of essential elements like hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   The gravitational constant, which affects Earth's ability to retain its atmosphere and the lifespan of the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   Earth's Van Allen belt and magnetic field, which protect against cosmic radiation while allowing necessary genetic mutations for evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

While conventional academia views these as happy accidents over eons, thinkers like RZ Ver suggest they point to intelligent creation or simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Ver proposes a "simulated Multiverse" where all possible values of these constants have been "run through," and we exist in the one tuned for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

### Information Theory in Nature

The universe appears to operate on principles similar to information theory, the basis of computer programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>:
*   **Repeating Patterns:** Nature exhibits consistent, repeating structures, much like reusable code in programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The Fibonacci sequence and Golden Ratio are observed in DNA dimensions, plant arrangements, and even spiral galaxies, suggesting a fractal, nested system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Binary Information (Bits):** The fundamental elements of information theory are "bits" (ones and zeros, on/off switches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. In nature, particles having matter-antimatter pairs (like electrons and positrons) or the base pairs in DNA (A-T, C-G) can be seen as analogous to binary switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

### Quantum Indeterminacy and Observation

The concept of "it from bit," coined by physicist John Archibald Wheeler, suggests that physical reality arises from a base substrate of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Quantum physics demonstrates that particles exist in "superposition" (like a probability wave) until observed or measured, at which point they "collapse" into a definite state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. This "lazy evaluation" where the universe doesn't render something until needed, mirrors how video games are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

The Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, proposed by Hugh Everett, suggests that all possibilities in a probability wave manifest as separate physical universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. While seemingly "absurd" due to the constant creation of new physical universes, this becomes plausible if the universe is information/computation, as only the information needs to be cloned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

## The Role of [[Consciousness beyond physicalism|Consciousness]] and [[Conceptualizing reality and perception|Perception]]

### Mind-Matter Interactions

Early proponents of quantum mechanics, such as Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, and John von Neumann, flirted with the idea that the mind is involved in the collapse of the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. Wheeler argued for a "participatory universe," where observation affects the outcome of an experiment, challenging the traditional scientific subject-object separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

Erwin Schr√∂dinger, who developed the wave equation, stated that [[Consciousness beyond physicalism|consciousness]] is "absolutely fundamental" and cannot be accounted for in physical terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. The *Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) lab* conducted experiments with "random event generators" (REGs), which produce binary outputs based on quantum randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. Their corroborated evidence suggests that an observer's intention can statistically skew the output, indicating a "dialogue" between the human mind and information processing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

### The Mind as an Interface

The mind may function as a graphical interface, not directly affecting the material world, but rather "your unique computational rendering of that Material World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. Cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman argues that perceiving the true nature of reality is not always adaptive for survival; instead, humans have evolved to see high-level abstractions like colors and sounds, which are efficient "application icons" allowing navigation rather than the underlying source code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

### Free Will and Consciousness

Roger Penrose's "orchestrated objective reduction" (Orch OR) theory suggests that within the brain's microtubules, spacetime exists in superposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. When a gravitational threshold is reached, quantum coherence is lost, and the wave function collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. This fleeting moment before collapse, where all outcomes exist in a "Quantum Haze," is where [[Philosophical and Existential Views on Life and Health|free will]] may come into play, driven by intention rather than pure computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

### Time and the Brain

If time and gravity are coupled, and gravity becomes negligible at subatomic levels, time might also become superpositional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. It's hypothesized that the brain decoheres time into a singular, linear timeline, and a highly coherent brain might access "shards of the future" or "future memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. This suggests that the mind might be choosing particular timelines, optimizing them like a quantum computer running game states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

## Breaking Out of the Simulation

The concept of a "simulation" implies ways to transcend or "break out" of it.

### High-Energy Physics and Reality Disruption

Applying extreme energy can disrupt physical reality or change time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. Nuclear weapons testing, particularly at extremely high energy outputs, might "rip holes in the fabric of reality" or send out "exotic electromagnetic or scalar longitudinal waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. This could explain [[Philosophy and modern UFO discourse|UFO]] sightings around nuclear blasts, as documented by Robert Hastings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Similarly, experiments with high mega-voltage and low currents, like those of Thomas Townsend Brown, have been linked to anomalous phenomena and implications for time travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

CERN's Large Hadron Collider, with its immense energy output, has even been associated with claims by physicists of "beings from portals coming in and out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. High energy output could lead to deeper layers of reality or ontological truth, potentially "breaking out of the simulation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.

### Ancient Mystical Practices and Altered States

Ancient traditions widely share the concept that the physical world is an illusion, often termed "Maya" in Hinduism or represented by Plato's Cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. Mystics devised "spiritual technologies" to achieve "celestial ascent" or "See Beyond the Veil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. These practices include:
*   Sensory deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>
*   Fasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>
*   Isolation and abstinence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>
*   Meditation and ceremonial ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>
*   Breathing techniques and intense visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>
*   Sometimes, even drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>

These methods, found across diverse cultures and religions (e.g., Jewish Merkabah Mystics, Indian yoga/pranayama, Daoism, ancient Egyptian pyramid texts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>, aim to induce altered states of consciousness, "derange the senses," and "break the servitude of soul to the body" to liberate the spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. The commonality of these experiences, including [[Neardeath experiences and their philosophical implications|near-death experiences]] (NDEs) and psychedelic trips where people report "more real than real" sensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>, suggests they are "Downstream of some sort of objective reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

#### Shared Metaphors
Across various traditions, common metaphors describe existence:
*   **Forgetfulness and Veiling:** The soul is said to forget its primordial self upon entering this reality, or reality is veiled from us, as in the Sufi tradition of "70,000 veils" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **The Body as Clothing/Container:** Metaphors like the Bhagavad Gita's comparison of the soul putting on and taking off bodies like garments, or the body being a "prison" for the soul, are found in Sufi traditions and across mythologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Life as a Game/Illusion:** The concept of "Maya" in Eastern traditions means not just "illusion" but "the power of illusion," where one chooses to suspend disbelief to "enjoy the show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>. Islamic scriptures describe the world as a "game," "pastime," or "sport," an "enjoyable delusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. This is likened to watching a horror movie where the audience enjoys the illusory terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.
*   **Ascent Through Heavens:** Texts from ancient Jewish Mystics, Egyptian pyramid texts, and Greek magical papyri describe the soul ascending through seven "heavens" or "palaces," often requiring specific rituals, passwords, and confrontations with "Celestial Gatekeepers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.

## Implications and Conclusion

If reality is a [[Simulation theory and the nature of reality|simulation]], it implies that we can potentially "optimize timelines" or choose "the best time possible timeline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>. This requires sensing multiple futures, which some models suggest humans do through intuition, distinct from [[Philosophical and metaphysical implications of AI|AI]]'s data-driven predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.

The danger lies in becoming "non-player characters" (NPCs), where one's daily behavior becomes entirely predictable by the simulation's model, leading to a loss of genuine agency and replacement by a "simulated human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

[!INFO] "NPC Mode"
The concept of "NPC mode" arises when individuals become so influenced by their environment and external programming that their decisions are no longer driven by internal intuition, but rather by predictable, pre-programmed responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>.

In contrast to the second law of thermodynamics (entropy), [[Consciousness beyond physicalism|consciousness]] might be the only "entropy reducer" on Earth, attracted to order and a driver in evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:33">[01:22:33]</a>. This suggests that [[Consciousness beyond physicalism|consciousness]] must be preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>.

The convergence of religious and scientific ideas pointing to a simulated universe suggests the importance of breaking out of it and ascending to a higher realm through cultivating virtue, rather than escaping into "lower, more bit-compressed digital worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>. As Erwin Schr√∂dinger concluded, "Atman equals Brahman" ‚Äì the individual soul is one with the universal absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.

Former US Air Force Security responder Mario Woods developed a profound interest in ancient structures and their potential connections to advanced technology after his [[Speculations on extraterrestrial life and UFOs | UFO]] encounter in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. This interest emerged as an almost "installed" or "downloaded" knowledge, prompting him to seek out information on archaeology and pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>.

## Pyramids as Power Generators

Woods believes that ancient pyramids were not merely tombs but highly advanced "power generators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:45">[02:44:45]</a>. He speculates that the power they generated was global, suggesting a period in history from which humanity has been "completely blacked out" regarding such knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:46">[02:47:46]</a>.

This perspective aligns with the theories of engineers and researchers like Christopher Dunn and Robert Schoch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>, whose work Woods highly regards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:02">[03:01:02]</a>.

### Christopher Dunn's Theories on Ancient Technology

Mario Woods supports Christopher Dunn's theory that the tools used to create and carve the massive granite blocks of ancient structures were far beyond the capabilities of known copper and wooden chisels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:29">[03:28:29]</a>. He highlights that some form of [[Advancements in technology and potential alien influences | advanced mathematics]] must have been employed in their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:35">[03:35:35]</a>.

Furthermore, Woods agrees with Dunn's assertion that the Great Pyramid's placement on the Giza Plateau was specifically chosen to support its immense weight, and that the entire plateau was constructed *before* the pyramids were erected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:42">[03:42:42]</a>. This raises a fundamental question: "Who had that technology and what was used? Who mandated that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:55">[03:56:55]</a>

### Robert Schoch and the Sphinx

Woods also cites Robert Schoch's work on the erosion marks of the Great Sphinx as evidence for a much older civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:07">[03:05:07]</a>.

## Stargates and Celestial Ascent Chambers

Woods connects his interest in pyramids to the concept of "Stargates" as depicted in the movie *Stargate*, suggesting that these ancient structures might have served as portals or "celestial ascent chambers" to other worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>. He sees a plausible connection between these ancient sites and the idea of [[Theories on lost civilizations and ancient advanced technology | ancient advanced technology]] capable of time travel or interdimensional transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

This idea is reinforced by the presence of [[The intersection of ancient myths and modern beliefs about extraterrestrial life | highly precise, astronomically aligned megalithic architecture]] around the globe that predates known historical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>. He posits that these sites might have been used for [[The possible connections between UFO sightings and humanmade technology | time travel]] or as portals, especially during cataclysmic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:47">[03:47:47]</a>.

## Interconnectedness of Ancient Knowledge and Modern Phenomenon

Woods suggests that some ancient knowledge, possibly related to advanced technology, has been "buried" or "removed from our everyday conscious thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:45">[04:45:45]</a>. He also notes a recurring theme of [[Speculations on extraterrestrial life and UFOs | UFO sightings]] around nuclear facilities, suggesting an interest from these phenomena in humanity's understanding of atomic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. This could be interpreted as a way for non-human intelligences to "gauge our intelligence" on the atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>.

Ultimately, Woods hopes that his testimony contributes to a broader understanding, fostering less fear toward the unknown and acknowledging the possibility of advanced civilizations that have been present on Earth for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:55">[01:59:55]</a>.

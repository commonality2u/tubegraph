[[whistleblower_testimonies_on_uaps | Whistleblower testimonies on UAPs]] include accounts of retrieving non-human craft. One specific [[ufo_retrieval_and_whistleblowers | UFO retrieval and whistleblowers]] incident involved an object referred to as "the egg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This object was deemed "extraordinary" and a "surprise to everyone" involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Retrieval Operation

The individual providing the account served as a helicopter pilot during the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Their task was to transport "the egg" using a long line, measuring 150 feet, which hung below the helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This line featured a remote hook designed to attach to hardware securing the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The pilot confirmed personally seeing the object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. They hovered directly over it to hook up to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The operation took place at night, but there was sufficient lunar illumination for the pilot to see "the egg" with the naked eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Description of the Craft

The recovered object, referred to as "the egg," was described as approximately 20 feet longitudinally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. A ground team was responsible for preparing the object for transport, which involved wrapping nets around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This process necessarily involved the ground team physically touching the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

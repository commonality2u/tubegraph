The study of secret aerospace programs and undisclosed aircraft forms a central theme in journalist Nick Cook's book, *The Hunt for Zero Point* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Cook, an aviation editor for Jane's Defence Weekly, dedicated decades to investigating classified stealth and supersonic aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. His work, often in collaboration with colleague Bill Sweetman, involved piecing together clues from the "black world" that were not intended for public release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Nick Cook's Initial Investigation

Cook's journey into [[UFOs and government secrecy | secret government programs]] began in 1994 when he discovered a photocopy of a 1956 magazine article titled "The G engines are coming" on his desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The article featured what looked like a UFO with a ladder, an Air Force pilot, and listed top aerospace companies of the day, including Lear, Convair, Bell, and the Martin Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. These companies expressed confidence in developing anti-gravity aircraft within years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

George S. Trimble, then VP of Martin Corporation's Research Institute for Advanced Study (RIAS), was quoted saying that human control of gravity could be achieved in about the time it took to build the first atom bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. However, by the early 1960s, these "G engines" and "weightless craft" were not publicly apparent, and the industry became silent on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

Cook's interest was piqued when a Lockheed PR executive relayed a message from Trimble, who initially seemed open to an interview but later refused to speak "not now, not ever," sounding "scared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This sudden change prompted Cook to delve deeper into the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Early Sightings and Official Acknowledgment

The possibility that some Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) might be man-made is a key consideration in understanding the UFO mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Early sightings of disc-shaped objects were noted, with the "Tic Tac" of today being compared to the "Flying Butane Tank" of the 1950s, as described in declassified Air Force OSI reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

In 1947, General Nathan Twining, head of the Air Material Command, issued a famous memo stating that UFOs were "not visionary or fictitious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. He described objects approximating a disc shape, as large as man-made aircraft, exhibiting metallic surfaces, absence of jet trails, and no propulsion sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. Twining further noted their extreme rates of climb and maneuverability, implying a novel form of propulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. Crucially, his postscript stated, "it is within our present knowledge to build these sorts of crafts" with ranges surpassing the U-2 spy plane, which had not yet been developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. This suggests that while their origin was unknown, the *capacity* to build such craft was considered within reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.

### World War II "Foo Fighters" and "Ghost Rockets"

During World War II (1942-1945), Allied and Axis fighter pilots reported seeing seemingly controlled "ball lightning" phenomena, dubbed "Foo Fighters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. By 1946, "Swedish ghost rockets" were observed, prompting General James Doolittle to investigate on behalf of President Eisenhower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. These appeared to be modified V2 rockets flying at unimaginable speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.

## Alleged Nazi Anti-Gravity Programs

Cook's investigation into the potential European origins of these saucers led him to explore circumstantial evidence around a secret weapons program under SS officer Hans Kammler, known as "Skoda Works" or "Kammlerstab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. Kammler, a high-ranking Nazi SS officer, oversaw the construction of concentration camps and was deeply committed to Nazi ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. In the final years of the Third Reich, he was in charge of the Nazis' most deadly weapons, including the V2 rocket, and had a secret plan to assassinate Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.

Kammler's "Kammlerstab" was a special projects office for "breakthrough technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>. Rumors suggest that Kammler negotiated with the Western Allies before the end of the war, offering his files on technologies in exchange for his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. Many believe that "Flying Saucer shaped craft" were part of his mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

Key figures associated with Kammler's alleged programs:
*   **Rudolf Schriever**: A German technician who claimed to have worked on a disc-shaped craft in Prague that made its first test flight in February 1945, climbing to 40,000 ft in 3 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.
*   **Victor Schauberger**: A naturalist and forester whose ideas on "free energy" or "zero point energy" (energy from the vacuum or ether) informed his diagrams for a flying saucer with an "impeller engine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>. Schauberger's diary entries suggest he was working in secret locations within Kammler's "Kingdom" of secret laboratories and underground facilities in Czechoslovakia and Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a>.
*   **Richard Maida**: Worked in high-voltage physics and also had designs for a flying saucer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.

Paul Mellon, one of the founders of the CIA, reportedly told his grandson that he saw a "German flying disc" in a hanger in Czechoslovakia at the end of WWII, refuting the idea it was a cobbled-together craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:08]</a>.

The "Glocke" (The Bell) was a rumored device from [[secret technological arms race and reverse engineering of UFO technology | Kammler's Skoda Works]] that purportedly produced time dilation and anti-gravitational effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. While Cook credits Polish writer Igor Witkowski for the story, his visit to the supposed installation site in Walenberg, Poland, revealed evidence of a "very secret installation" with extensive cabling, suggesting significant electrical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. Over time, Cook concluded it was likely one of several German SS sites investigating nuclear weapon technology beyond the known Heisenberg program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>. Witkowski believed the project was called "Kronos," the Greek god who ruled over time and, in a sense, reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

## Post-War US Anti-Gravity Research

The 1950s saw a bizarrely "in vogue" study of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>. Theoretical physicists like Stanley Deser and Richard Arnowitt explored "G particles" or gravitons, which would theoretically mediate the force of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>. Their 1954 winning essay for the Gravity Research Foundation essay contest highlighted this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>. As mathematician Lewis Whitten stated, "anti-gravity was in the wind," meaning it was both ubiquitous and simultaneously scattered or obfuscated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.

An Australian intelligence memo from 1971, cited by David Grusch, indicated a deep, yet hidden, American interest in anti-gravity during the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>. This memo, written by Harry Turner of the Australian Joint Intelligence Organization (Australia's CIA), listed the same top aerospace companies mentioned in the 1956 article (Martin Corporation, Lear, Convair, Bell) as actively involved in gravity research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>. It also named prominent physicists, including Robert J. Oppenheimer, as deeply involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>. Six top academic institutions, such as Princeton, the Institute for Advanced Study, and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, conducted gravity research at the behest of the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>.

A.B. Bason, an industrialist obsessed with anti-gravity, founded The Institute for Field Physics at UNC Chapel Hill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>. In 1957, he convened the Chapel Hill conference, a pivotal event in the "Golden Age of Relativity," which brought together top physicists like John Wheeler, Richard Feynman, and Freeman Dyson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. This conference was sponsored by Wright Airfield, a hub of UFO rumors, which had its own theoretical physics anti-gravity division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>. Lewis Whitten, working on gravity at George Trimble's special research division (RIAS) at Martin Corporation, also attended the conference and was funded by Wright Airfield for his gravity research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:00">[28:48:00]</a>.

The extensive funding and resources directed into gravity research in the 1950s suggest that if progress was made and subsequently militarized or turned into Special Access Programs (SAPs), it would appear as if no progress occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>. Bason's science fiction book, *The Stars Are Too High*, involving rogue Nazi scientists building man-made flying saucers using anti-gravity, further highlights the contemporary fascination and potential reality of such developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>.

## Thomas Townsend Brown and Electrostatics

Thomas Townsend Brown, a mid-century engineer and inventor, is a controversial figure whose work has been linked to anti-gravity and the B-2 stealth bomber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>. Brown's work involved electrostatics, which can reduce radar signature and drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. Northrop, an aerospace company, published papers in the early 1960s on "electro-aerodynamics and electrogravitics," a term used to describe Brown's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:49:00">[31:49:00]</a>.

A demonstration of Brown's "fan precipitator" to Edward Teller in 1965 reportedly "freaked Teller out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27:00">[32:27:00]</a>, who was himself involved in anti-gravity research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>. This led to Floyd Odom, a prominent aerospace investor and majority owner of Northrop, becoming Brown's sole investor in his company, Guidance Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>. Despite Brown shutting down the company in 1967, claiming no results, Northrop published a paper on electrogravitics just three months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:32:00]</a>.

Two decades later, when Northrop's B-2 stealth bomber was revealed, *Aviation Week* reported it used an "electrokinetic effect" in its wings, producing a "Byfield-Brown effect" where the B-2 "surfs its own electrostatic wave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>. Brown's wife continued to receive checks from Odom for the rest of her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>. Aviation journalist Bill Gunston, another Jane's editor, questioned the B-2's performance data, suggesting it shouldn't be able to take off given its engine power, and alluded to Brown's work while stating he didn't "want to end up in the Tower of London" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>.

Brown's potential involvement in the rumored "Philadelphia Experiment" (1943), which allegedly made the USS Eldridge invisible and teleported it, is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:39:00">[37:39:00]</a>. While the lore is exaggerated, the experiment likely involved a high-voltage envelope to scramble the ship's magnetic signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:15:00">[38:15:00]</a>. Brown was stationed at Norfolk, Virginia, at the time and confirmed the experiment happened but its events were exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>. An FBI file from 1943 noted Brown "knew more about radar than anyone in the Navy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>. This suggests that the best disinformation often contains a kernel of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>.

## Later Anti-Gravity Research and Disappearances

NASA also showed interest in anti-gravity in the mid-1990s, following reports from Russian scientist Evgeny Podkletnov about a weight-loss effect in objects suspended over rapidly rotating superconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:38:00">[39:38:00]</a>. NASA attempted to replicate this but was unable to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:05:00">[40:05:00]</a>.

**Ning Li**, a Chinese American physicist, became a focus of interest due to her anti-gravity experiments and subsequent "bizarre disappearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a>. Lee, based at the University of Alabama Huntsville, developed a theory of gravity manipulation involving the alignment of ion rotation in a Bose-Einstein condensate to counteract gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:08:00">[41:08:00]</a>. She claimed experimental results showing test masses losing between 0.5% and 2.1% of their weight above a spinning superconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:26:00">[41:26:00]</a>. Such a breakthrough would unify electromagnetism and gravity, something Einstein couldn't achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:59:00">[41:59:00]</a>.

Lee left the university to start her own company, AC Gravity LLC, joined by her physics chair Larry Smalley, who was convinced by her results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>. Smalley was also on NASA patents for a barrel-shaped asymmetric capacitor, suggesting a potential link between Lee's and Brown's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46:00">[42:46:00]</a>. AC Gravity LLC won a DOD contract, and Lee obtained a security clearance, after which she became secretive and went "off grid" around 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:15:00">[43:15:00]</a>. In 2008, she refused a CCP offer to continue her work in China, resulting in a travel ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>. Lee believed this science should be "for the people" and philanthropic in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>. Concerns were raised about the dual-use potential of such technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:19:00">[45:19:00]</a>.

## Skunk Works and Enigmatic Statements

Ben Rich, director of Lockheed Martin's secretive Skunk Works division from 1975, played a vital role in developing American stealth planes like the F-117 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:30:00">[48:30:00]</a>. Towards the end of his life, at a UCLA speech in the 1990s, Rich made "very strange comments" alluding to Skunk Works having the technology to "take ET home" and travel across star systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>. When asked how, he responded by asking how ESP works, adding, "All points in space and time are connected. That's how it works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:26:00">[49:26:00]</a>. On his deathbed, Rich reportedly told John Andrews, "We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>.

Rich spoke in parables, describing how stealth technology was so challenging that burying the entire project to prevent others from getting the idea was considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:00">[50:29:00]</a>. He likened it to the atomic bomb's secrecy, where open discussions about atom splitting disappeared once its potential was realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:00">[51:02:00]</a>. A rift existed between Rich and his predecessor Kelly Johnson over the development of stealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:41:00">[51:41:00]</a>. Rich suggested that such advanced projects could be "boxed up" and "slid into a warehouse" not to be opened until a future date, referencing the warehouse at the end of *Raiders of the Lost Ark* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>.

The resurgence of Skunk Works' public involvement in UFO organizations like Tom DeLonge's To The Stars Academy, with director Robert Weiss's interest, raises questions about aerospace's long-standing interest in "Mind Over Matter effects" or parapsychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:40:00">[52:40:00]</a>. James McDonald of McDonald Douglas was known to instruct his company to study UFOs to learn from them for aerospace programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>. Aerospace and defense industries are known to explore "heretical science" far more readily than academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:48:00">[54:48:00]</a>, as exemplified by the CIA's 18-year funding of psychic spying (remote viewing) despite its lack of scientific explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:57:00">[54:57:00]</a>. Ben Rich reportedly referred to UFOs as "unfunded opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:20:00">[55:20:00]</a>.

## Aurora Project

The "Aurora" project is a mythical aircraft rumored to be a replacement for the SR-71 Blackbird, the fastest jet-powered airplane ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>. Bill Sweetman was convinced of its existence, piecing together clues from the "black world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:30:00">[57:30:00]</a>. Evidence included:
*   **Seismic Anomalies**: The US Geological Survey detected "unattributable Sonic booms" from the Pacific heading towards Area 51 in Nevada, not attributable to the Space Shuttle or SR-71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:24:00">[58:24:00]</a>.
*   **Oil Rig Sighting**: In the North Sea, Royal Observer Corps observer Chris Gibson reported seeing a "Dart-like Black Arrow shaped thing" escorted by F-111s and refueled by a Boeing KC-135 tanker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:56:00">[59:56:00]</a>.
*   **Cover Program**: Sweetman believed the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program (X-30), which received significant funding from Reagan, was a cover program for Aurora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. NASP channeled technologies like scramjets and new pyrocermic materials from the "white world" (non-classified) into a classified program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
*   **UK Ministry of Defence**: British MoD documents from the early 1990s discussed hypersonic craft with novel propulsion from the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Budget Line Item**: The Aurora reportedly showed up as a line item for $2 billion in a 1980s budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **RAF Pilot Accounts**: RAF pilots claimed to have encountered the Aurora over the North Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

In 1998, Cook interviewed General George Mullner, then head of US Air Force research and development, on his retirement day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Mullner presented a "puzzle" about a gap in US reconnaissance capabilities in the late 1980s/early 1990s due to the SR-71's retirement and the transition to new digital satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. He implied that something like Aurora, a "Deployable Prototype," could have filled this gap, being expensive but useful for its ability to operate where satellites couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This suggests Aurora was a temporary solution until the satellites were fully operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.

### The "Astra" Incident

During an interview at Skunk Works headquarters in the mid-1990s, Cook was shown an organizational chart depicting aircraft from the Skunk Works' beginnings. Above the F-22 prototype or the Darkstar drone, he saw an entry called "Astra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>. When he asked about it, he was quickly escorted out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>. A later Skunk Works boss confirmed awareness of the "Astra incident," stating it hadn't flown *yet* but would "make an appearance sometime soon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. Cook later realized the incident occurred on April Fool's Day, suggesting he might have been intentionally misled as part of a subtle game to make him write about a potential classified aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. This highlights the complex nature of information control in the world of classified aerospace programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

## Implications for UFO Disclosure and Future Technology

The existence of deeply buried secret programs, such as those related to anti-gravity, could explain the lack of public progress in certain scientific fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. If these advanced technologies are hidden in black projects, as Ben Rich suggested, it creates a situation where the public cannot discern the true state of scientific advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

Some argue that if the US is currently in an arms race to [[secret technological arms race and reverse engineering of UFO technology | reverse engineer UFOs]] with Russia and China, the decentralized and siloed nature of American programs, which peaked in the 1950s and 60s, is a significant disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. These corporations, focused on protecting intellectual property and profits, may not be attracting new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. In contrast, nationalized efforts in Russia and China focus on national defense and actively recruit top scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

[[UFO disclosure and secrecy | Government secrecy and UFO disclosure]] is also influenced by national security concerns, which tend to gain lawmakers' attention more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. The concept of "dual-use technology" means that any scientific breakthrough can have both beneficial and destructive applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a>.

Ultimately, cracking the gravity question could be the key to interstellar travel and "jumping timelines" in a potential Multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>, as gravity and time are tightly coupled in general relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This perspective offers a hopeful vision of the future, moving beyond current dystopian narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>.

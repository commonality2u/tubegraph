Interstellar objects are celestial bodies that originate from outside our solar system. One such object, Oumuamua, garnered significant scientific attention due to its unusual characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:82">[06:48:82]</a>.

## Discovery of Oumuamua
In 2017, the Pan-STARRS telescope located in Hawaii discovered a fast-traveling object in space named Oumuamua <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:14">[06:53:14]</a>. The name "Oumuamua" translates to "a scout, a messenger from far away" in the Hawaiian language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:03">[07:00:03]</a>. The object was estimated to be about the size of a football field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:44">[07:08:44]</a>.

## Anomalous Properties
Oumuamua did not conform to the known criteria for asteroids or comets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:06">[07:11:06]</a>.
Its most striking anomaly was the absence of a cometary tail, which is a typical form of propulsion for space rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:35">[07:16:35]</a>. Additionally, Oumuamua exhibited erratic changes in speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:53">[07:20:53]</a>.

Initial proposals to explain these anomalies suggested that it was "a rock of a type that we've never seen before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:15">[07:22:15]</a>. Scientists made various guesses, including a chunk of frozen nitrogen, a cloud of hydrogen, or a dust cloud, but all these theories had inconsistencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:80">[08:04:80]</a>.

## Dr. Avi Loeb's Theory
Harvard astronomer Dr. Avi Loeb proposed a new theory: Oumuamua was a light sail, a thin structure that uses the reflection of sunlight for propulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:06">[08:13:06]</a>. Nature typically does not produce such thin solid objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:04">[08:21:04]</a>, and a length-to-width ratio above three is rarely observed in asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:07">[08:27:07]</a>. Based on these observations, Dr. Loeb speculated that Oumuamua might have been [[Speculations on extraterrestrial life and UFOs | intelligently designed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:41">[08:32:41]</a>. He detailed his theory in a book titled *Extraterrestrial* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:24">[08:36:24]</a>.

Dr. Loeb faced considerable backlash from his academic peers for even considering the possibility of another intelligent civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:73">[08:42:73]</a>.

> "Many of my colleagues in academia still say it's extraordinary to even consider that there is another intelligent civilization out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:73">[08:42:73]</a>

## Subsequent Discoveries
In September 2020, Pan-STARRS discovered another baffling object that was similar to Oumuamua <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:56">[08:56:56]</a>. This object was also traveling away from the sun and lacked a cometary tail or visible propulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:84">[09:00:84]</a>. It was later identified as a forgotten rocket booster from a 1966 NASA mission, which also used sunlight for propulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:40">[09:08:40]</a>. This discovery prompted the question: if humans can build light sails, why couldn't [[Speculations on extraterrestrial life and UFOs | extraterrestrials]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:98">[09:22:98]</a>

Dr. Loeb suggests that an AI-driven approach to analysis could be beneficial for classifying such objects in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:14">[09:27:14]</a>. An AI system, unburdened by ego, might more readily identify unusual objects as equipment rather than unknown types of rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:04">[09:33:04]</a>.

> "The ai system would say, well, it doesn't look like any rock we've seen before. Therefore, maybe it's a piece of equipment just like we launched but being produced by someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:16">[09:37:16]</a>

The prospect of [[reverse_engineering_ufos_using_quantum_computers | sending a rover to sample]] such an object is considered an incredibly exciting future possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:44">[10:02:44]</a>.

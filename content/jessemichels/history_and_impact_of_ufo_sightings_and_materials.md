Dr. Gary Nolan, a distinguished microbiologist and geneticist at Stanford, embodies a conventionally successful academic, but with a significant exception: his deep interest in Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Nolan believes that "when your mind expands to a certain point in terms of what you might consider reality to be, other entities live there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. He has even claimed to possess what may be [[encounters_with_alleged_ufo_materials | UFO parts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Funding Disparity in UFO Research

Despite interest in UFOs from the "upper echelon of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, [[historical_and_ongoing_research_into_ufo_phenomena_and_advanced_technologies | research]] in this field suffers from a severe lack of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. For instance, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), the main [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ufo_investigative_groups | UFO program]] out of the Department of Defense (DOD) over the last 15 years, had a budget of $22 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This is minuscule when compared to fighter jet budgets, which often exceed $100 billion, meaning the discovery of extraterrestrial life and advanced propulsion receives less than one percent of the F-35 budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Nolan attributes this lack of advancement to insufficient funding and negative feedback within the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## CIA Involvement and Neurological Studies

The CIA approached Dr. Nolan's lab for help in determining if people who claimed [[historical_religious_contact_experiences_and_modern_ufos | UFO contact]] exhibited any neurological and physiological differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Initially, Nolan thought it was a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. He was introduced to "the invisible college," including [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Jacques Vallee]], [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Hal Puthoff]], [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Eric Davis]], and [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Robert Bigelow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

By analyzing MRIs of individuals, many of whom had interactions with UFOs, Nolan's team identified an area of the brain that appeared "disturbed or different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This area, between the head of the caudate and the putamen, showed increased neural density and was larger in these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. These individuals were described as highly functioning and capable of making snap decisions, which Nolan relates to intuition or high intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Fascinatingly, this genetic component was also found in their family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Nolan posits that this brain structure may allow individuals to "widen the doors of our normal limited scope of perception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, enabling them to recognize UFOs that others cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. He suggests that human senses act as a filter to prevent the brain from being overwhelmed by reality, offering only a limited aspect of everything around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This concept is supported by studies on Japanese chess masters, where intuitive, brilliant moves corresponded with activity in the caudate and putamen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Nolan is also exploring this area of the brain in relation to autism and schizophrenia, noting that schizophrenics "hear things and see things that nobody else sees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## UFO Materials and Anomalous Properties

[[historical_and_ongoing_research_into_ufo_phenomena_and_advanced_technologies | Research on UFO materials]] is another critical component of Nolan's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Jacques Vallee]], a scientist who helped develop a computerized map of Mars for NASA and contributed to ARPANET (an early internet version), has collected such materials from around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Vallee, known for his "multi-dimensional hypothesis" that aliens could co-exist unseen alongside us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, sends these materials to Nolan for spectroscopy and material analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### The Ubatuba Magnesium Sample
One notable sample mentioned by Nolan is from Ubatuba, Brazil, where a fisherman witnessed an exploding orb and collected some of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Analysis revealed it was magnesium with an "extremely high level of purity," which is strange because magnesium burns readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Using a highly sensitive NanoSIMS instrument, Nolan's team performed a mass spectrometry analysis, determining not only the elements but also their isotopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The magnesium isotope ratios were "way anomalous," unlike anything found naturally on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Such ratios would require an expensive centrifuge to create, leading to questions about their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Nolan ponders if these ratios are essential for certain functions or if they are a byproduct of an unknown process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### The Bismuth Sample from Roswell
Another sample consists of pieces of bismuth. [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Hal Puthoff]] explained that this material was anonymously sent by an army officer who found it in his grandfather's archives, with a diary entry claiming it was a piece from [[historical_ufo_incidents_and_evidence | Roswell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. These thin layers of bismuth and magnesium are challenging to reproduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. Puthoff claims they possess properties capable of micro-sizing waveguides for terahertz frequencies, reducing the required guide size to about 1/30th of the wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Terahertz frequencies are considered the "next thing" for communication, allowing for denser information packing and faster transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

Nolan stresses the need for standardized processes to test these materials, such as subjecting them to high velocities, extreme temperatures, or underwater environments, to understand their properties like conductivity or resistance to rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. He suggests that a skeptic could even propose experiments to be conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

## Theories on Alien Existence and Contact

There are various theories regarding the nature and origin of "aliens":
*   They could be from another planet in this galaxy or elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   They might be from another level of reality that humans don't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   They could have been here all along, observing humans, potentially looking at their past selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Some hypothesize that aliens might be humans from the future, with smaller bodies and larger heads, resembling the "grey alien" archetype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

[[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Jacques Vallee]] was the original proponent of the multi-dimensional hypothesis, suggesting aliens could co-exist unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The [[historical_accounts_of_ufos | Jacques Vallee]]/Diana Pasalka theory posits that prior to the [[historical_ufo_incidents_and_evidence | Roswell]] crash in 1947, people reported seeing angels, demons, leprechauns, or fairies, aligning with local contemporary lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. After aliens entered the zeitgeist, people began reporting seeing aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. This theory suggests that humans perceive a "proto-architecture of a thing" involving beings and crafts, and then recollect it in a way that is comprehensible within the prevailing myths of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

Nolan uses the analogy of intelligent ants in a garden: they cannot comprehend what happens in the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. To communicate, one might create a small ant-like figure to interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Similarly, aliens, being so profoundly different, might be attempting to communicate with humans in ways they can understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. The term "alien" itself implies "so far different from us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

The concept of the [[impact_of_ufos_on_religion_and_society | Fermi Paradox]], [[historical_figures_and_ufo_programs | Enrico Fermi]]'s question of why humans don't see aliens, highlights that even a scientist who created the theoretical underpinnings for splitting the atom was contemplating extraterrestrial life in his free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This demonstrates that thinking about "new ideas" should not be "heretical" in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## Government Stance and Future Implications

The Department of Defense has admitted that UAP data is real, though conclusions about their nature remain elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Nolan suggests that perhaps aliens are interested in humanity's technological advancements, such as the splitting of the atom, which occurred around the time of the [[historical_ufo_incidents_and_evidence | Roswell]] incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. They might also be interested in humanity's understanding of its own genetic building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. From a perspective of beings a million years ahead, they might be monitoring humanity to ensure "angry monkeys" don't run around with bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.

Ultimately, Dr. Nolan advocates for open scientific inquiry into anomalous data, as "almost every major discovery has been somebody looking at anomalous data and then constructing a new theory of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. He calls for standardized processes for analyzing materials and welcomes skeptics to suggest what should be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

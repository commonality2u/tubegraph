The **Manson Murders**, specifically the Tate-LaBianca murders, are considered the most famous murders in American history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While the official narrative attributes the brutal crimes to cult leader [[Charles Manson and the Sharon Tate murders|Charles Manson]] and his followers, journalist Tom O'Neill spent 20 years investigating a potential hidden plotline involving [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]] brainwashing and [[MK Ultra mind control program|government mind control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The Manson Family and the Murders

[[Charles Manson and the Sharon Tate murders|Charles Manson]] led a cult with 10 to 15 "wives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The group lived communally, initially at the Spahn Ranch and later in Death Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. The official narrative, developed by prosecutor Vince Bugliosi, stated that Manson believed in an impending race war, which he called "Helter Skelter" after the Beatles song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Manson allegedly ordered the murders to shock the world and implicate the Black Panthers, intending to trigger this race war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The victims, including Sharon Tate, who was eight months pregnant, were stabbed more than 200 times, and blood writing was left on the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

A key question that emerged was how [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] was able to compel young women to kill strangers without remorse, and even laugh about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This unique aspect fascinated the public and led to deeper investigations beyond the conventional narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## [[MK Ultra mind control program|MK Ultra]] - The [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]]'s Mind Control Program

[[MK Ultra mind control program|MK Ultra]] was a brainwashing program developed by the [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]] from the late 1940s into the early 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Initially conceived as a defensive measure against perceived Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean brainwashing techniques (using [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|drugs]], sensory deprivation, and other "technologies" to induce false confessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, it quickly evolved into an offensive program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The ultimate goals of [[MK Ultra and CIA mind control techniques|MK Ultra]] included:
*   Creating "programmed assassins" who could be hypnotized to kill without recollection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   Developing programs for "mass conversion" to control thousands of people using media and other technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   Implanting information in people's minds to courier across enemy lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Controlling people's memory, including implanting false memories and removing true memories, using [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|drugs]] like sodium pentothal and [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|LSD]], and hypnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The program was exposed by a whistleblower around 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]] was forced to acknowledge it, despite the illegality of operating on U.S. soil and the horror of human experiments conducted without knowledge or consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Experiments began in prisons and jails, then extended to service people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. "Safe houses" were set up in San Francisco and New York City where prostitutes administered [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|LSD]] to unwitting "Johns" for observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Richard Helms, then running the [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]], ordered all files destroyed around 1973-1974 amidst the Watergate scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. However, financial files discovered by State Department official John Marks led to Congressional investigations, including the Church hearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]] lied, claiming the programs were ineffective and disavowing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, but much of the work *was* effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Pervasiveness of [[MK Ultra mind control program|MK Ultra]]
[[MK Ultra mind control program|MK Ultra]] was widespread, involving hundreds if not thousands of psychiatrists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Outposts existed in Canada, where Ewen Cameron performed "torturous techniques" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Andre Puharich's Round Table Institute in Maine and an outpost in Upstate New York (where "space kids" tried to communicate with "otherworldly beings") also had connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Even *Star Trek* creator Gene Roddenberry's ideas were allegedly channeled via a woman named Phillis Schlemmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Notorious figures like Whitey Bulger and Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) were later found to have voluntarily participated in [[MK Ultra mind control program|MK Ultra]] experiments while in prison or at Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Connecting Manson to [[MK Ultra and CIA mind control techniques|MK Ultra]]

The investigative journalist began looking into what [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] had learned and where he gained the knowledge to control his followers so effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This led to a connection with Dr. Louis Jolyon West, known as Jolly West.

### Dr. Jolly West
Jolly West, head of UCLA Psychiatry and founder of the first Neuroscience Center, was alleged to have been part of the [[MK Ultra mind control program|MK Ultra program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. He conducted research with [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|LSD]] on hippies at the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in 1967, which is when [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] began his cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

Upon accessing West's papers at UCLA after his death, O'Neill found evidence that West was secretly working under an alias for Sidney Gottlieb, the head of the [[MK Ultra and CIA mind control techniques|MK Ultra]] program at the [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]] (known as the "poisoner in chief") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. West's experiments and [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]]'s arrival in San Francisco paralleled each other, and it's suggested that during this period, [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] transformed into the type of programmed individual the [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]] had been trying to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

In 1955, Jolly West reported to the [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]] that he had developed the technology to implant false memories and remove true memories using [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|drugs]] and hypnosis permanently and without the subject's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. A key paragraph about this successful memory control was censored from the version of West's report submitted to Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.

### Manson's Transformation and Surveillance
Before 1967 and his time in Haight-Ashbury, [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] was a petty criminal, not particularly charismatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. His transformation into a "sex god cult leader" happened within roughly a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

Key figures in Manson's life during this period include:
*   **Roger Smith**: Manson's parole officer, who was also a criminology student at Berkeley and a drug researcher specializing in adolescent kids joining violent gangs while using [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|drugs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **David Smith**: Ran the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. The Church Commission revealed "Operation Midnight Climax," where individuals like [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] would be dosed with [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|LSD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

There is compelling evidence that [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] was being tracked by authorities before the Tate murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. Spahn Ranch, where the Manson Family resided, was raided and bugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. A mysterious figure named Reevs Witson, who told friends and family he worked for the government, confessed before his death that he was part of an undercover operation infiltrating the Manson family for a government agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. He regretted not preventing the murders and claimed he was at the crime scene after they occurred but left before police arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Physical evidence also suggests someone else was at the property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

## Broader Context: Co-opting Counterculture

The [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]] had an operation called Operation Chaos, started in 1967 in San Francisco, alongside the FBI's COINTELPRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. These programs were designed to neutralize the left-wing and Black militant movements in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. Agents would infiltrate groups to provoke them into committing crimes that could lead to their deaths or internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. The FBI admitted to orchestrating the murders of two Black US Slaves on the UCLA campus in 1968, months before the Tate murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

The Tate house represented "liberal Hollywood," which was increasingly supporting Black Panthers financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. FBI head J. Edgar Hoover wrote a memo in November 1968, stating that white supporters of the Panthers should fear being "slaughtered with the rest of the white population" when a revolution occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Five white people were slaughtered in a house embodying the left-wing Hollywood establishment just months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

The theory suggests that creating a figure like [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] – a counterculture revolutionary type who committed savage acts – served to co-opt and discredit the wider [[impact_of_mk_ultra_on_hippie_and_counterculture_movements|hippie and counterculture movements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The Tate murders were widely seen as the "day the 60s ended," tearing apart the hippie movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. The image of the "flower children" from Laurel Canyon with guns and [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|drugs]], trying to kill each other, marginalized the entire movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. After Manson's arrest, the media portrayal of his long-haired female followers as savage murderers instilled widespread fear of hippies overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Further Evidence and Connections

*   **Jolly West and Jack Ruby**: Jolly West's specialties included inducing insanity without the subject's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. When Jack Ruby, who shot Lee Harvey Oswald, was to give testimony to the Warren Commission, West was assigned as his psychiatrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. After an hour alone with Ruby, West held a press conference declaring Ruby had a psychotic break and would never recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. From that day, Ruby could not string three coherent sentences together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This raises questions about whether West, who was working for the [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]], influenced Ruby's mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

*   **Early Life in Institutions**: [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] spent much of his life in federal institutions from age 12 or 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. Notably, [[MK Ultra mind control program|MK Ultra]] research was being conducted at these very institutions, looking for delinquent boys prone to crime and violence who lacked external family support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

*   **Stranger in a Strange Land**: [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]]'s life seemed modeled after Robert Heinlein's 1968 sci-fi novel *Stranger in a Strange Land*, which was popular among hippies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Despite being supposedly illiterate, Manson named his son "Don Valentine" (a variant of Michael Valentine from the book) and nicknamed his parole officer, Roger Smith, "Jubal," after a protector character in the novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. The novel's themes of a leader creating a new society with communal wives and a race war align with Manson's ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. This raises the question of whether [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] was dosed with [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|LSD]] and compelled to internalize this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

*   **Shady Figures**: Numerous "spooky figures" were on the periphery of [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]]'s life between 1967 and 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:46">[0:19:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]] FOIA requests for some of these individuals resulted in "glomo responses" (neither confirm nor deny), implying their affiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Prosecutor Bugliosi later "erased" any trace of these figures from the official narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **The Grateful Dead**: There are ongoing investigations into potential connections between the Grateful Dead, their early distribution of free [[the role of LSD and mind control in the 1960s|LSD]] at concerts, chemist Owsley Stanley, and the [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]]'s involvement in [[MK Ultra mind control program|MK Ultra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

While there is no definitive "smoking gun" directly linking [[Charles Manson and the influence of government experiments|Manson]] as an [[MK Ultra mind control program|MK Ultra]] patient, the circumstantial evidence, the confluence of figures around him, and his dramatic transformation suggest a compelling, darker history that aligns with the [[CIA and potential involvement in the Manson case|CIA]]'s extensive [[MK Ultra and CIA mind control techniques|mind control techniques]] research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. This suggests that the government may have known more about these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

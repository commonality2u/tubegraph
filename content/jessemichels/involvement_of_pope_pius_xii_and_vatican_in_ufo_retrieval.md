A narrative suggests that Pope Pius XII and the Vatican were involved in the back-channeling of [[ufo_retrieval_and_whistleblowers | UFO custody]] following an early crash event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This information was reportedly heard from David Grush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## The Lombardy Magenta Crash

David Grush indicates a "magenta crash" occurred in Lombardy, Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Following this [[ufo_crash_retrieval | crash event]], a sequence of events is proposed:
*   **Initial Discovery and Nazi Involvement** After the crash, Mussolini approached Hitler, inquiring if the object belonged to the Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. They subsequently collaborated on the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Vatican Custody and OSS Liaison** The [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]] may have been involved in the custody of the crashed material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Pope Pius XII and the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]] are described as having been involved in back-channeling the information and material through the [[role_of_the_oss_in_early_ufo_custody | OSS]] (Office of Strategic Services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Transition to US Custody** The material then reportedly transferred to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, where work on it continued at Wright Airfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Key Figures and US Involvement

Before the formation of the CIA, the [[role_of_the_oss_in_early_ufo_custody | OSS]] was initially responsible for [[ufo_retrieval_and_whistleblowers | UFO custody]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. James Jesus Angleton, an [[role_of_the_oss_in_early_ufo_custody | OSS]] operative, was the US person involved in Italy at the time of the Magenta crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

A "rush" to acquire Nazi scientists after World War II was partly motivated by the desire to obtain experts knowledgeable in "exotic flight principles" and [[vatican_and_ufo_research | UFO]]-related subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Hans Kammler, who managed "blackest of the black" VFA programs for the Nazis, subsequently came to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This forms a consistent narrative regarding the events of this early [[ufo_crash_retrieval | UFO crash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

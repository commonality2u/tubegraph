Dr. Garry Nolan is a distinguished microbiologist and geneticist at Stanford University, known for his work in spinning up multiple successful companies [00:00:12]. Despite his conventional academic success, Nolan has a profound interest in the subject of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), often referred to as UFOs [00:00:34]. He even claims to possess what may be UAP parts in a locked bank account [00:56:00].

## Collaboration with the CIA and Neurological Studies
In a surprising turn of events, the CIA approached Dr. Nolan for assistance a few years ago [00:01:31]. The agency sought to determine if individuals claiming UAP contact exhibited any [[neurological_studies_related_to_ufo_encounters | neurological and physiological differences]] [00:01:41]. Nolan initially thought the inquiry was a joke [00:01:35].

Nolan was introduced to members of what he calls the "invisible college," including [[Jacques Vallees background and contributions to UFO research | Jacques Vallée]], Hal Puthoff, Eric Davis, and Robert Bigelow [00:05:51]. They provided him with MRIs of individuals who reported UAP interactions, many of whom were Department of Defense and intelligence personnel [00:06:04].

Upon analyzing these MRIs, Nolan's team identified a specific area of the brain, located between the head of the caudate nucleus and the putamen, that appeared "disturbed" or different [00:06:17]. This region exhibited increased neural density and was larger in many of these individuals [00:06:30]. This area is associated with intuition and the ability to make snap decisions [00:06:40]. Intriguingly, this enlarged structure was also found in the family members of those with UAP contact, suggesting a possible genetic component [00:06:50].

Nolan believes this neurological difference allows individuals to "see" or "recognize" UAPs for what they might be, rather than dismissing them [00:07:21]. He posits that human senses act as a filter, limiting perception, and this brain structure might "widen the doors of our normal limited scope of perception" [00:07:38]. He draws a parallel to studies of Japanese chess masters, where the caudate and putamen lit up during intuitive, brilliant moves [00:08:26]. Nolan is now exploring this area further by studying it in individuals with autism and schizophrenia, noting that schizophrenics "hear things and see things that nobody else sees" [00:08:52].

## Analysis of Alleged UAP Materials
A significant aspect of Dr. Nolan's work involves the analysis of alleged UAP materials. [[Jacques Vallees background and contributions to UFO research | Jacques Vallée]] has collected such materials globally, and Nolan performs spectroscopy and material analysis on them [00:09:39].

### Ubatuba Magnesium Sample
One notable sample originated from Ubatuba, Brazil, where a fisherman witnessed a glowing object explode off the coast and collected some parts [00:10:43]. Analysis revealed the material was magnesium of extremely high purity [00:10:53]. The oddity lies in magnesium's flammability, suggesting other components were present [00:10:59].

Using a highly sensitive nanosims instrument in the engineering department, Nolan's team performed mass spectrometry to determine not only the elements but also their isotopes [00:11:06]. The magnesium isotope ratios were found to be "way anomalous," unlike anything found naturally on Earth [00:11:31]. Such ratios would require a centrifuge or similar expensive and inaccessible technology to create [00:11:47]. The motivation for creating such specific isotope ratios or whether it's a byproduct of an unknown process remains a mystery [00:12:03].

### Roswell Bismuth-Magnesium Sample
Another sample consists of pieces of bismuth. Its procurement history was unclear to Nolan, prompting a call to Hal Puthoff, who confirmed it was sent anonymously by an army officer [00:21:19]. This officer claimed to have found the sample in his grandfather's archives, with a diary entry stating it was a piece from Roswell [00:22:01].

These thin layers of bismuth and magnesium are very difficult to reproduce [00:22:13]. Hal Puthoff claims they possess properties that could enable micro-sized waveguides for terahertz frequencies, reducing the required size to about 1/30th of the wavelength [00:22:16]. Terahertz frequencies represent the "next thing" for communication, allowing for denser and faster information packing [00:22:47].

Nolan emphasizes that the materials' properties, such as their ability to withstand super high velocity, extreme temperatures, or resistance to rusting underwater, should be investigated to understand their full potential [00:23:12].

## Funding, Stigma, and the Future of UAP Research
Despite interest from the "upper echelon of society," UAP research suffers from a severe lack of resources [00:04:46]. The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (ATIP), the main UAP program of the Department of Defense, had a budget of only $22 million over 15 years [00:04:53]. This pales in comparison to fighter jet budgets, which often exceed $100 billion [00:05:06]. This disparity means that discovering extraterrestrial life or advanced propulsion systems receives less than one percent of the current F-35 budget [00:05:16]. This lack of funding hinders scientific advancement in the field [00:04:36].

Nolan and the interviewer lament the "heretical" stance of established scientists who debase those interested in new ideas, despite historical scientific revolutions often stemming from examining anomalous data [00:15:05]. They reference Thomas Kuhn's "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" and how new theories are often fought "tooth and nail" by conservative skeptics [00:15:17]. They also mention John Mack, the head of Harvard's psychiatry department, who studied alien abductions [00:15:34].

Regarding the nature of UAPs, Nolan explores several possibilities:
*   **Extraterrestrial Origin:** Beings from another planet in this galaxy or elsewhere [00:02:00].
*   **Interdimensional/Other Reality:** Entities from "another level of reality that we don't understand" [00:02:05].
*   **Observational Presence:** They might have "been here all along" and observe humanity, perhaps viewing their past [00:02:06].
*   **Future Humans:** Aliens could be humans from the future, with smaller bodies and larger heads, resembling the "grey alien" archetype [00:14:20].

Nolan also discusses the "Jacques Vallée-Diana Pasulka theory" that historical sightings of angels, demons, leprechauns, and fairies shifted to aliens after the Roswell crash in 1947 [00:16:10]. This suggests that "proto-architecture of a thing" involving beings and crafts is interpreted through the contemporary cultural lens [00:16:38]. He uses the analogy of humans making an "ant-like" object to communicate with intelligent ants to explain how these entities might try to interact with us [00:16:54].

The fact that these objects are seemingly leaving behind materials, whether intentionally as "breadcrumbs" or as discarded byproducts, provides an opportunity for reverse engineering [00:12:12]. The "five observables" of UAPs, such as trans-medium travel and instantaneous stops, suggest these materials might unlock properties for such advanced features [00:12:50]. Nolan also considers the possibility that some UAPs are not technological objects but "some kind of living thing" [00:13:14].

Nolan advocates for a standardized process for analyzing UAP materials, creating a flowchart of necessary tests and making the data available to both skeptics and "true believers" for an evidence-based debate [00:24:25]. He believes that when the mind expands to comprehend a larger reality, "other entities live there" [00:18:47]. The presence of figures like Enrico Fermi, who thought about aliens in his off-time, demonstrates that questioning the unknown is a legitimate scientific pursuit [00:18:31].

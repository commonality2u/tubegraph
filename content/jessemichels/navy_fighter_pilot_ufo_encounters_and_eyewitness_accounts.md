The topic of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) in airspace has gained significant attention, particularly through the [[Experiences and testimonials of military personnel witnessing UFO activities | eyewitness accounts]] of Navy fighter pilots such as Ryan Graves and David Fraver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. These [[UFO and UAP phenomena witnessed by military personnel | sightings]] are described as routine, not rare or isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Nimitz Encounters (2004)

Commander David Fraver's experience at the Nimitz in 2004 involved a craft hovering right above the water, appearing to go in and out of the water, suggesting a "transmedium" capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

## Eastern Seaboard Encounters (Ryan Graves)

Ryan Graves, a former F/A-18 pilot with a decade of service in the U.S. Navy, provided testimony regarding UAP encounters off the coast of Virginia Beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:5:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Initial Observations and Radar Upgrades
During a maintenance phase when the squadron was upgrading its radar systems from the APG 73 (mechanically scanned array) to the more precise ABG 79 (electronically scanned array), objects were immediately detected in a working area off the coast of Virginia Beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While older radar systems might pick up false reflections from cars or clouds, the new system was designed to filter out such errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Initially, pilots assumed these were merely radar errors or "bugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Anomalous Behaviors
However, the objects' behavior was inconsistent with false tracks:
*   **Steadiness:** They were steady, solid, and consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Stationary in High Winds:** Some objects remained perfectly stationary (0.0 Mach) over the ground, even in Category 3 hurricane-type winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **High Speeds:** Some objects were observed traveling over the speed of sound, at 1.1 or 1.2 Mach, which is fast even for a Super Hornet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Operating Patterns:** They would operate at 0.6 to 0.8 Mach in holding, circular, or racetrack patterns, which is inconsistent with typical radar errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Meandering:** Sometimes they moved with non-consistent headings and altitudes in a "sloppy way," which is inefficient for known aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Lack of Propulsion:** No propellers, visible propulsion, or exhaust plume were observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. They appeared to mask their infrared signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

### Multi-Sensor Detection
The objects were not only detected by radar but also by:
*   **ATFLIR (Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared):** The Fleer system, looking where the radar pointed, detected energy coming back from the objects, often appearing like a flashlight shining into the sensor rather than an aircraft skid or propulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **AIM-9X Missile Systems:** Missile systems also detected and locked onto these objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
This correlation across three different sensors confirmed the presence of physical objects, making it irresponsible to ignore them due to potential safety risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Visual Sighting and Near-Miss
Despite multi-sensor detection, visual confirmation was difficult. Pilots would fly to reported locations but often saw nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. However, in one instance, an object shot down the left or right wing of a lead aircraft, coming within approximately 50 feet of the cockpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The pilot described it as a "dark gray or Black Cube inside of a clear sphere," estimated to be 5 to 15 feet in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. This incident led to a safety report, which uncovered four other unreported near-midair collisions within the squadron over previous months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## Lack of Conventional Explanation
At the time, pilots did not speculate on what the objects could be, as "UAP" was not a familiar term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. They considered possibilities like civilian attack or adversarial capabilities, but the observed behaviors (no propellers, no propulsion, infrared signature masking, extreme speeds, constant presence) did not fit any known categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. The objects did not respect boundaries of designated training areas, flying through international commercial channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

## Broader Scope of Sightings

### Military Personnel Experience
Approximately 10 out of 25 pilots in Graves' squadron had witnessed these objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. Later, when a *New York Times* article on UAP came out, about half of the pilots in his ready room, even those he had known for years, confirmed seeing "cubes and spheres" without prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. Similar shapes have been reported by fighter pilots at other Navy bases, including those in California (LaMore, Fallon) and Pax River (test pilot training) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

### Other Military Incursions
Recent [[Military involvement with UFO phenomena | incidents]] include:
*   **Langley Air Force Base (2022):** "Drones swarming the base" for 17 days, leading to F-22s being moved due to fear of losing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.
*   **Norfolk Naval Base:** Similar incursions at the largest naval base on the East Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
*   **Washington D.C.:** Reports of similar objects over D.C. itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

### Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs)
The phenomenon extends underwater, with reports of "Unidentified Submersed Objects" (USOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. Submarine personnel are generally very secretive, but the underwater environment has much less "traffic" than airspace, suggesting a higher likelihood of truly bizarre sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. [[Historical accounts of UFOs | Historical records]], such as those from Columbus's era, also mention unexplained underwater sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet, former head of NOAA, is highly interested in these underwater anomalies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

## Anomalous Properties and Speculation

### Inertial Reference Frames
The observed UAP behaviors, such as stopping instantaneously at supersonic speeds, suggest a capability to manipulate or control inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. This implies a physical mechanism that defies known physics, as such sudden stops would typically lead to catastrophic destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

### Sensor Limitations and Masking Signatures
Current military sensor systems are calibrated to detect known aircraft heat signatures (from engines and air friction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. If a UAP propels itself through an entirely different mechanism, expelling energy equally across its surface, it might appear as a "blur" on FLIR, effectively masking its true form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. This could be an intentional masking system or a byproduct of its propulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.

### Intentionality and Adversarial Capabilities
While Graves' squadron did not experience UAP actively reacting to their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>, other [[experiences_and_testimonies_of_military_personnel_on_ufos | instances]] have been reported where objects maneuvered around aircraft, such as a sphere pulling up within 15 feet of a cockpit at Pax River, or an object in New Orleans chasing and overtaking a jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. Initially, Graves' squadron considered the possibility of an adversary observing their tactics and decrypting radios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. However, the idea that these are secret U.S. programs being "red-teamed" over international waters with exposure to unauthorized personnel or adversarial presence seems illogical due to the massive security risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

## Congressional Testimony and Public Advocacy

Ryan Graves testified before Congress, voicing the concerns of more than 30 commercial aircrew and military veterans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. This hearing was significant as it was non-partisan and collaborative, with members of Congress working together to understand the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

Graves believes David Grusch's claims of a covert reverse engineering and crash retrieval program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>. He respects Grusch's work with the UAP Task Force and sees no reason to doubt his honesty, noting that Grusch provided over a thousand pages to the Inspector General, who deemed the information "urgent and credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

## Safety and National Security Implications

UAP pose significant safety and national security risks:
*   **Collision Risk:** The potential for mid-air collisions is a primary concern, especially for military pilots operating at the edge of their cognitive ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. Reports exist of aircraft mysteriously going missing or crashing after hitting airborne objects of unknown origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>.
*   **Operational Uncertainty:** Unidentified, non-responsive vehicles operating near military bases create massive issues, as pilots must 100% know the identity of all aircraft in a tactical scenario to avoid unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Stigma:** The stigma surrounding UAP reporting prevents pilots from documenting incidents, leaving critical gaps in understanding potential adversarial observation of military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.

## Public and Private Sector Efforts

There is a growing desire for greater transparency and understanding of UAP. Ryan Graves supports the UAP Disclosure Act, which would create a review panel with authority to declassify information for public consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

The private sector is increasingly engaged in UAP-inspired research:
*   **Technology Development:** Companies are working on advanced propulsion, materials, and energy production that could be consistent with UAP observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Detection Capabilities:** Graves himself started a company to build next-generation space situational awareness cameras that can provide highly detailed information on non-traditional orbital trajectories, useful for both satellite awareness and UAP detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

The goal is to push for greater understanding through open-source technology and commercial projects, rather than solely relying on government disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. This approach aims to circumvent the traditional academic environment, where competition for grants and career concerns can hinder exploration of unconventional physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. The possibility that UAP technology represents an "alternative timeline" for propulsion, perhaps driven by different planetary conditions (e.g., high gravity planets making chemical rockets non-viable), is also considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.

Ryan Graves emphasizes that full disclosure would involve acknowledging the reality of UAP, stating they are not from Earth, are not an adversary system, and are not trickery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. He views withholding such information as "a crime against humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

Harald Malmgren, a 27-year-old aid to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, played a pivotal role in averting nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This period was considered the heart of the [[Cold War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, with images from an American U2 spy plane revealing the Soviet Union had secretly begun building missile bases in Cuba, just 90 miles off the coast of Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Diplomatic Intervention in the War Room
Amidst the escalating tensions, Strategic Air Command (SAC) was placed in DEFCON 2, the only time in United States history this has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Both Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and President John F. Kennedy were under pressure from their top military strategists to "draw first blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. General Curtis LeMay, head of SAC, was particularly aggressive, advocating for a "death blow to the Soviets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Malmgren was appointed as the liaison between McNamara, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, and President Kennedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. His directive from McNamara for the war room was crucial: "Don't tell them what you think should happen. Ask them a lot of questions. Your job is to slow them down. reduce the heat in the room and give us time to work something out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Malmgren effectively "ran circles" around aggressive four-star generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, succeeding in his task of slowing down the military's push for immediate, aggressive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

## Confrontation with General Curtis LeMay
In the final hours before a potential nuclear strike, Malmgren challenged the prevailing logic of mutually assured destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. He argued that if Moscow were hit, "there's no one to talk to" to de-escalate the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This direct challenge led to LeMay storming out of the room, slamming his papers down, and declaring, "I refuse to run with this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. LeMay's raising of the warning level to DEFCON 2 was notably unapproved by the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>.

Malmgren's strategic questioning and calm demeanor helped create an environment where a diplomatic resolution could be reached. This intervention prevented a nuclear catastrophe, a feat the narrator describes as the "least interesting thing" to discuss about Malmgren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, given his later claims about [[handling_of_ufo_materials_by_harold_malmgren | UFO materials]] and high-level briefings.

## Subsequent Revelations
Malmgren later revealed that he was informally briefed on "other world technologies" by Richard Bissell, the deputy director of plans for the CIA and chief architect of Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Bissell confirmed the existence of the 1933 Magenta [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | UFO crash retrieval program]] in Italy, a topic recently reported on by whistleblower [[david_grusch_and_the_ufo_crash_retrieval_program | David Grusch]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Malmgren's own experiences, including direct encounters with anomalous material recovered from a Marshall Islands nuclear test plume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, highlight a broader narrative of secrecy around [[ufos_and_nuclear_weaponry_connections_during_the_cold_war | UFOs and nuclear weaponry connections during the Cold War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>, and the deep, often unseen, forces at play in global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:52">[03:11:52]</a>.

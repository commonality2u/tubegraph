Josh Wolfe, co-founder and managing director at [[lux_capital_and_its_role_in_nuclear_waste_cleanup | Lux Capital]], highlights nuclear energy as the optimal solution for large-scale, zero or very low-carbon baseload power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. He argues that existing fission plants do not require cutting-edge technology to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Anti-Nuclear Sentiment

A significant challenge for nuclear energy is public perception, largely influenced by the "no nukes" movement of past generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. This movement conflated nuclear war with nuclear power, changing the zeitgeist to an anti-nuclear stance when a pro-nuclear approach was and is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

Wolfe suggests rebranding nuclear energy as "Elemental Power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, aligning it with other renewable sources by describing solar as "elements of the sun," wind as "elements of the wind," and nuclear (using uranium) as "elements of the earth" for zero-carbon power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## Nuclear Energy as a Climate Change Solution

Wolfe emphasizes that progress in nuclear technology is crucial for addressing global warming, whether it is man-made or accelerated by human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. He views nuclear as "clearly the best renewable energy to solve climate change long term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

### Limitations of Other Renewables and Fossil Fuels
*   **Wind and Solar:** These sources are described as volatile, seasonal, and geographically specific on the supply side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Natural Gas and Fracking:** While they cut carbon emissions, they do not eliminate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

### Debunking Nuclear Dangers and Downsides

Wolfe asserts that the dangers and downsides of nuclear energy are "completely overstated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

*   **Chernobyl:** The classic example of a nuclear disaster, its containment structure is completely outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. Modern facilities could have avoided the 4,000 deaths attributed to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Fukushima:** Despite its horror, it is very hard to attribute any direct deaths to the Fukushima disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   **Dual-Use Argument (Weaponry):** The idea that nuclear power plants can easily be converted into weaponry is dismissed as "basically bs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. It would take years of lead time to take plutonium from an energy reactor and create a nuclear weapon, and finding enriched uranium is incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## Current State of Nuclear Energy Development

The U.S. is "pathetically behind" in nuclear energy compared to countries like Sweden and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. While there are portable microreactor companies and some building larger plants, the sector feels somewhat stagnated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. China appears to be leading, with projects like the Bill Gates-funded super reactor (TerraPower's traveling wave reactor) that can repurpose waste into fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## Nuclear Waste Management

Historically, the biggest unsolved problem with nuclear power has been waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Large amounts of problematic waste exist at pre and post-Cold War bomb-making sites like Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. A significant portion, 25%, of the Department of Energy's budget is spent on nuclear waste cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

[[lux_capital_and_its_role_in_nuclear_waste_cleanup | Lux Capital]] co-founded Curion in 2008, a company named after Marie Curie, to address the previously unsolvable problem of nuclear waste cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Curion was among the first companies to mass extract cesium and strontium from high concentrations of saltwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster was a "black swan event" that uniquely positioned Curion to help with the cleanup, boosting its revenue from $1 million to nearly $200 million in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Curion's ability to purify the super clean water used in nuclear power plants made it the only solution for setting up a giant engineering system at Fukushima to remove 99% of the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

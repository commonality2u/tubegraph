The [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta UFO crash of 1933 in Italy]] is a significant event in [[historical_ufo_incidents_and_evidence | historical UFO incidents and evidence]], explicitly confirmed by high-level sources such as Richard Bissell, former Deputy Director of Plans for the CIA and chief architect of Area 51 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Presidential adviser Harold Malmgrren directly heard Bissell mention the 1933 [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta crash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This event is considered the first known [[ufo_crash_retrieval | UFO crash retrieval]] in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>.

## Event Details
In June of 1933, a disc-like object, approximately 10 to 12 meters in diameter, reportedly crashed near Magenta in Lombardi, Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>.

### Mussolini's Regime and Cover-up
Under Benito Mussolini's fascist regime, a complete media blackout was imposed via the Stefani news agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:41">[01:36:41]</a>. Telegrams issued threats of severe penalties for any reporters deviating from a government-ordered cover story, which attributed the event to a meteor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:46">[01:36:46]</a>.

Despite the censorship, a special investigative body named "Gabonetto" or "RS33" was formed to study the craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:56">[01:36:56]</a>. High-level figures such as Mussolini, Air Marshal Italo Balbo, and Nobel laureate and radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi are believed to have been involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:02">[01:37:02]</a>. The downed craft, and possibly two recovered bodies, were reportedly taken to the SI Marchetti private aerospace hangers for intensive analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>. This secret research group reportedly developed a nine-step protocol for managing the [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta crash]] and similar future incidents, including immediate site containment, witness arrests, and thorough disinformation campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:21">[01:37:21]</a>. Marconi, who was fascinated by extraterrestrial possibilities, reportedly clashed with Mussolini's insistence that the object be of terrestrial origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a>.

### Vatican Involvement and US Retrieval
In the late 1930s, Pope Pius XII became aware of the [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta retrieval]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:57">[01:37:57]</a>. Fearing that any recovered technology might fall into Nazi hands after Italy allied with Germany, the Pope reportedly informed the Allies about the craft's existence and storage location through discrete channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:01">[01:38:01]</a>. This back-channel intelligence led the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the predecessor to the CIA, to intervene in northern Italy as World War II concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>.

Working under a secret project called "McGregor," OSS operatives aimed to access advanced technologies, including the rumored crashed UFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28">[01:38:28]</a>. By 1945, the Americans reportedly transferred the Italian UFO to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio for further study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:39">[01:38:39]</a>. Many top Nazi scientists brought to the U.S. as part of Operation Paperclip also worked at Wright-Patterson on the [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta craft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:51">[01:38:51]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Connections
The [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta crash]] and its handling highlight connections between the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican and UFO research]], powerful secret societies, and early US intelligence operations.

### Knights of Malta
Harold Malmgrren stated that the Knights of Malta were deeply embedded in the UFO story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:16">[01:39:16]</a>. This organization, associated with the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]] and possessing sovereign state diplomatic status, is believed to have played a role in governing UFO secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>. Key figures involved in post-war intelligence and UFO matters were members of the Knights of Malta:
*   Hugh Angleton and James Jesus Angleton: James Jesus Angleton, a CIA founder and key figure in counter-intelligence around UFOs, was reportedly a member of the Knights of Malta through his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:32">[01:39:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>. His father's involvement with the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]] might suggest a role in the retrieval of the [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta crash]] object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:15">[01:43:15]</a>.
*   Colonel Philip J. Corso: A high-ranking intelligence officer in Italy during the post-war period, Corso was a Knight of Malta and a key figure in Operation Paperclip, helping exfiltrate Nazi scientists and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.
*   General Douglas MacArthur and staff: MacArthur, who spoke of an "interplanetary war," and many of his intelligence staff were Knights of Malta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:30">[01:40:30]</a>.
*   Wild Bill Donovan: A chief OSS member and CIA founder, Donovan was likely involved in the [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta crash retrieval]] and establishing original protocols for [[ufo_crash_retrieval | UFO crash retrievals]], and was also a Knight of Malta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:02">[01:41:02]</a>.
*   Other CIA Directors: John McCone and Bill Casey were also Knights of Malta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>.
*   FDR's Vatican Envoy: Myron Taylor, President Roosevelt's envoy to the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]] regarding the [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta craft]], was a Knight of Malta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:28">[01:41:28]</a>.
*   Joint Special Operations Command (JOC): Modern heads and members of JOC, involved in contemporary [[ufo_crash_retrieval | UFO crash retrievals]], are reportedly Knights of Malta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>.

The prime minister of Italy in 1973 was aware of Harold Malmgrren's childhood exposure to the Sicilian mafia in Rhode Island, suggesting a transnational network of influence tied to organized crime, the [[vatican_and_ufo_research | Vatican]], and the state in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This informal network highlights a deeper layer to politics beyond elected officials or visible bureaucracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:52">[03:11:52]</a>.

### Nazi and Italian Technological Advancement
The historical period surrounding the [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta crash]] also connects to discussions of advanced technology. After World War II, German scientists were prohibited from aircraft development, leading them to specialize in drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:07">[01:47:07]</a>. Similarly, Northern Italy is noted for its world-class engineering in many fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>. The collaboration between Mussolini and Hitler regarding the crashed object may have led to the formation of the Axis powers due to the shared interest in super high-tech development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>. Italy continues to be among the most innovative in defense technology globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>. This suggests potential inherited technology or continued advanced research stemming from the [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta crash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>.

The story of the [[magenta_crash_in_lombardy_italy | Magenta crash]] and its handling by various powers suggests a long-standing, secretive management of non-human intelligence and advanced technologies, influencing geopolitical alliances and the development of classified scientific research.

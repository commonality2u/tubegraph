Parapsychology is a fringe field of physics that studies mind over matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It explores functions of the mind that cannot be described purely by brain processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This field suggests that our classic understanding of consciousness, limited by five senses and memory, is potentially broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) Lab

Herb Metz, a parapsychologist, worked for over a decade at the PEAR lab at Princeton University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The PEAR lab was founded in 1979 by Bob Jahn, the dean of the engineering school and a plasma physicist who worked with NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Jahn, initially a "hard-headed scientist," became involved after a student demonstrated anomalous mind-over-matter effects using a random event generator (REG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. He was convinced that this experiment could be paradigm-shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### What is a Random Event Generator (REG)?
A random event generator (REG) is a device that produces random output, typically one of two different states (like a coin toss), using a quantum process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This quantum process is provably random in quantum field theory, such as radioactive isotope decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Over a long enough time scale, an REG should produce an equal amount of ones and zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### REG Experimentation and Results
The PEAR lab conducted experiments where observers attempted to influence the output of REGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The experiments revealed that an observer's intention could have a statistically significant skewing effect on the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. When participants tried to produce more ones, the chart line consistently went up; when they aimed for more zeros, it went down; and when they tried to keep it even, the line stayed in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The final data chart from PEAR definitively showed that subjects were able to influence the REGs as tasked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

Further details on PEAR lab findings can be found in books by Bob Jahn and Brenda Dunn, such as "Margins of Reality" and "Consciousness and the Source of Reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. A recent paper by Etzel Cardena reviews 40-50 years of parapsychological research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

### The Mind Lamp
Herb Metz developed variations of REGs, including the mind lamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. These lamps have an REG built into their base that influences the colors they emit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. When attempting to change the mind lamp's color to green, with 8 possible colors, the probability of getting green on the first try was 12.5% (1 in 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Considering the lamp could stay on any color for up to three minutes, the chance of getting any color within the first 30 seconds was 16% (1 in 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Multiplying these probabilities gives a 2% chance of getting green on the first try within the first 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

## Challenges to the Scientific Paradigm

### The Experimenter Effect
A significant challenge in studying REGs and parapsychology is the "experimenter effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Gertrude Schmeidler, a parapsychologist active in the 1950s-70s, categorized participants as "sheep" (those who believe in psychic phenomena) or "goats" (those who don't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Her studies consistently showed that "sheep" achieved much better effects than "goats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This implies that the experimenter's belief system can influence study outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### Epistemological Overhaul
This phenomenon raises questions about scientific epistemology, suggesting that a priori skepticism can ironically affect experimental results, creating a "tautological impossible loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. The current scientific worldview often suppresses competing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. If phenomena occur independently of physical forces, it challenges the prevailing physicalist model, where consciousness is solely brain-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### The Nature of Consciousness
The binding problem of consciousness — how optic, auditory, and motor experiences become a unified experience — remains unexplained within conventional science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The existence of phenomena like remote viewing, where perception occurs at a distance, suggests that a "transmission concept of consciousness" is more likely than a purely physicalist model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Anomalies and Scientific Paradigm Shifts
[[exploring_anomalies_and_the_evolution_of_scientific_methods | Anomalies]] often exist for years within existing scientific frameworks without explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. A scientific paradigm shift can then explain these former anomalies; for example, black body radiation, discovered in the 1860s, was only adequately explained by quantum physics in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Despite concerns about repeatability and instrumentalizing parapsychology into predictable technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>, researchers like Herb Metz have an optimistic outlook for consciousness research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. It is believed that new tools will emerge to separate mind functions from brain functions and recombine them to understand their interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Interventions like transcranial magnetic stimulation could potentially enhance people's ability to affect devices like REGs by "zapping the part that inhibits" a better effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

It is considered inevitable that neuroscience will eventually find functions of the mind that cannot be purely described by brain processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. The work with REGs provides clear evidence that brain-mind systems perform actions not yet understood by current biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Despite the dramatic implications parapsychology might have, less than $30 million has been spent on it globally in the last 100 years, which is less than the cost of a single particle accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This contrasts with billions spent on conventional physics, which has seen progress stagnate since the early 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. Given the evidence from "hard-headed experiments" and [[hidden_government_programs_on_ufos_and_anomalies | government programs]] like Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>, further investigation and resources for parapsychology are warranted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

Other notable psychic phenomena related to government programs include:
*   The CIA's Stargate Project (1972-1995) used "remote viewers" to identify targets like Russian nuclear bases and lost American hostages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   Joe McMoneagle, "remote viewer number one," vividly described a novel Russian nuclear submarine (Typhoon) eight months before its public reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   Rosemary Smith identified a lost spy plane (TU-22) in Zaire within a three-mile radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   Paul Smith described the USS Stark incident, including the attack by Exocet missiles from an Iraqi jet, days before it occurred during the Iran-Iraq War in 1987, demonstrating [[time_loops_and_precognition_in_human_experience | precognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Stargate was declassified in 2017, and its files are available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. For more information, Herb Metz's book "The Selection Effect" and Paul Smith's "The Essential Guide to Remote Viewing" are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

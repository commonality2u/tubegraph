## Introduction to Jacques Vallee's Perspective

The world of [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] can be challenging to navigate, requiring an "internal compass" to discern trustworthy sources from those spreading disinformation or performing psychological operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Amidst this complexity, long-time researchers like Jacques Vallee stand out for their genuine quest for meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Vallee, a serious researcher with backgrounds in computer science, physics, and astronomy, even contributed to the earliest version of the internet, ARPANET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. He has spoken with more [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO]] witnesses and examined more exotic material than almost any living person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. In fact, it's almost conventional knowledge that if an average citizen encounters a [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO]] crash, they should mail the materials to Jacques Vallee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Vallee's work is dense and detailed, often hinting at deeper truths, such as his suggestion in *Revelations: Alien Contact and Human Deception* that Bob Lazar might have been an MK Ultra patient, subjected to government brainwashing to believe he worked on reverse-engineering [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. What makes Vallee particularly interesting is his blend of mysticism and hard science, his interest spanning esotericism, parapsychology, and the material science and physics of [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. His character even inspired François Truffaut's eccentric yet brilliant scientist in Steven Spielberg's *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## UFOs Across Time and Culture

Vallee’s most well-known contribution to [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | ufology]] is his argument that [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] are not necessarily aliens from outer space, but rather [[Role of UFOs in the study of time and consciousness | interdimensional beings]] that have been interacting with humanity for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. This concept is explored in his 1969 book, *Passport to Magonia*, where he moved away from the extraterrestrial hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

The idea of "flying saucers" is a modern term, invented two years after the 1945 Trinity crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Vallee posits that [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO]] phenomena predate events like Roswell (1947) and Trinity (1945), suggesting that "flying saucers" are merely the contemporary manifestation of something that has occurred for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. He argues that people have always witnessed what we now call "aliens," citing examples of shamans speaking of "little men who came out of a big light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

Vallee suggests that these non-human entities might have used tactics like intermittent reinforcement, confusion, deception, and absurdity to influence human historical narratives over thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This leads to the idea that Celtic leprechauns, medieval angels and demons, and modern space aliens could all be the same phenomenon, interpreted through the "noble mythology" of their respective times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

For example, the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case (1961) described aliens with eyes around the rim of their heads, a depiction similar to a popular sci-fi show that premiered just before their alleged abduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. While this could imply brainwashing, Vallee suggests it might simply be witnesses struggling to comprehend an experience so profound that they attach the closest available cultural "meme" to it, whether that be space aliens, angels, or demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

## The Absurdity and Interdimensional Nature of UFOs

The Trinity crash event itself, where a "metallic avocado shaped object" appeared near the test site just 20 days after the first atomic bomb test, is presented as an example of the "inherently absurd nature of [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Vallee speculates that such an event might have aimed to "open up a parallel historical and strategic path," one that "superseded even the taming of the atomic force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The apparent "absurdity" of the [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]]' behavior, such as a three-ton avocado-shaped craft or 11 F-18s chasing a [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO]] that can evade radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>, serves a purpose in a "control system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This behavior, like a Zen koan, "stops your brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

One of the most striking aspects of [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO]] accounts that points to their interdimensional nature is the phenomenon of the "inside being bigger than the outside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Witnesses describe a craft that appears to be the size of a house from the outside, but once entered, reveals a vast interior, like a movie theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This is explained through the concept of higher dimensions, similar to a 3D object intersecting a 2D plane, where only a sliver is seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. A 4D hypercube, or tesseract, when projected into our 3D reality, would appear as two nested cubes, not revealing its full internal properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

## Higher Dimensions and Perceptual Reality

This concept extends to our understanding of reality itself. According to physicists like Eric Davis, our dimensions of space and time are "arbitrary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. There is "something deeper that creates the illusion of space and time in humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. Reality, from a physicist's perspective, is like "quantum foam," not tied to any particular space or time, with its own internal properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. Our human perception, for instance, seeing a table as solid, is merely our "delusion" of this underlying reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

This implies that we might be "swimming in these things" – [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] or other phenomena – but simply lack the perceptual capacity to detect them in our normal reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Some individuals, like Mr. PK Tetro or Chris Bledsoe, are described as "biological sensors" of [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]], suggesting a connection between the human body's energy and its capacity for perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. The fact that some people repeatedly see [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]], with phenomena following them even after they leave a site like the Utah ranch, suggests a profound interaction with an entity that "may play with your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

This notion of reality also touches upon simulation theory, described as an even "more radical" idea than [[Role of UFOs in the study of time and consciousness | time travel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. A story from AI founder Dr. McCarthy suggests that if human behavior becomes entirely predictable by a model, one could be "replaced by a simulated human," hinting at a deeper, possibly non-physical, underlying structure to existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## UFOs as a "Control System"

Vallee's work suggests that these [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO]] phenomena may act as a "control system" influencing humanity, not through direct command, but through a pattern of intermittent reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This psychological principle, demonstrated by B.F. Skinner, suggests that sporadic rewards or encounters create a stronger, more persistent change in behavior than consistent ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Applied to [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]], this means that infrequent, bizarre encounters might be more effective in co-directing human evolution than a blatant landing on the White House lawn, which would quickly be dismissed as a trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

The Trinity crash, viewed through this lens, could be interpreted as a "show of force," a subtle communication that "you think you're really smart because you blew up... a weapon... for the first time in history, no no look at this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This "trickle-down effect" implies that these phenomena aim to deter nuclear weapon use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

The question arises whether these entities are "airdropping technology," influencing human technological advancement, or if their presence creates a "demonic apocalyptic force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Accounts from individuals like Philip J. Corso, who claimed a covert government group was assembled to reverse-engineer [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO]] debris from Roswell, leading to technologies like fiber optics and lasers, highlight this potential technological influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. However, Vallee shares an anecdote of a priest telling him to "burn" a complex circuit he found, saying it was "from the Devil," suggesting that some technology might be a "trick" or something to be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

The idea that technological and scientific innovation is "zapped into the inventor's mind," like Wolfgang Pauli figuring out the hydrogen atom's architecture, aligns with the concept of a "genius" as an "attendant spirit," implying an external source of knowledge or influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. Massive energy outputs, like nuclear explosions, might open "a window to another plane," allowing for an increased flow of information and paranormal activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

## The Merging of Science and Spirituality

Vallee has a long-standing interest in esotericism, particularly Rosicrucianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. His group of [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO]] researchers and his book, *The Invisible College*, were named after Robert Boyle's 17th-century group of natural philosophers heavily influenced by Rosicrucian ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

Vallee believes that [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFO]] research has the potential to heal the historical divide between science and spirituality, a schism created by the Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. If [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] and aliens are real, it could mean that biblical literalism becomes acceptable, past religious conversions were "alien abductions," and the wheels of Ezekiel were simply [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. This transforms the scientific observation of [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] into a [[Epistemology and metaphysics in the context of UFOs | metaphysical quest]] for greater meaning and has vast implications for humanity's teleology and fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

The presence of [[UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena | UFOs]] could lead to a [[the_merging_of_science_and_spirituality_through_ufo_phenomena | re-merging of science and spirit]], potentially even forming a "[[UFOs and religious connection | UFO-based religion]]" that integrates both scientific inquiry and technological understanding with spiritual and metaphysical dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. This perspective offers an experience of wonder and "fusion with the universe," rather than terror, akin to astronauts describing their view of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.

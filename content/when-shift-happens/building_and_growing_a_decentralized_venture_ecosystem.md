Hash, a global early-stage venture fund, plays a pivotal role in [[Building and growing a decentralized venture ecosystem | building and growing a decentralized venture ecosystem]], particularly focusing on blockchain and cryptocurrency. The firm's journey began with a strong belief in decentralized networks and empowering founders to raise capital directly from the people, bypassing traditional venture capital rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Origin and Evolution of Hash

Hash's origins trace back to 2016, when its co-founders began as individual investors, deeply studying Ethereum and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The 2017 crypto boom provided an opportunity to gather high-profile individuals, including developers, founders, conglomerates, and venture capitalists, to evangelize the future of blockchain in Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This initiative led to the spontaneous formation of the Korean crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Initially, the community was driven by a shared passion for crypto, focusing on academic discussions around new ideas, consensus algorithms, and token designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. As the community grew, founders recognized its value and began offering allocations, turning Hash into a de facto private sale investor or crypto fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Ryan Kim transitioned from his data scientist job to full-time investing by November 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

The official crypto fund was launched in 2018, following the market peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Despite the subsequent crypto winter, Hash maintained its conviction in the decentralization thesis, believing the market would rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Over seven years, Hash has evolved from a community-driven fund to a more institutionalized entity with established systems and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

### Core Philosophy
Hash views itself as an "alternative VC system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. Their aim is to make a better, more sustainable ecosystem by contributing capital and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. This includes engaging with politicians, governors, and regulators to foster crypto-friendly policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

## Investment Strategy

### Defining Success
For Hash, the success of a project is primarily measured by user activity and the number of users onboarded, rather than just Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) or TVL (Total Value Locked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. They believe in the fundamentals of crypto, linking trust in the technology (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) to its fundamental value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

### Market Timing
Hash believes in consistently investing in founders and projects, regardless of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. However, they are more aggressive during bear markets due to lower valuations, and less so during bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. While they sometimes pass on projects due to high valuations, they still try to invest a small amount to engage with good founders and expand their network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

### Focus Areas and Key Bets
In 2019, during the crypto winter, Hash identified gaming as a key sector for mass adoption, drawing parallels to the internet era where addictive and entertaining services led the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. They launched Hash Labs, an incubation team, and invested in eight gaming companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Notably, they were early investors in:
*   Axie Infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>
*   The Sandbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>
*   Mythical Games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>
*   Node Games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>

Four of these became unicorns, validating their thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. Hash also remains bullish on [[The development of decentralized trading networks | Ronin Network]], highlighting its balanced team, experience in successful game building (Axie Infinity), existing large user base (700,000 daily active users), and strong marketing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

Beyond gaming, Hash is exploring the integration of blockchain with popular cultural phenomena like Japanese Anime and Korean K-pop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.
*   **Anime:** Through their portfolio company, Kasak Labo, they aim to onboard Japanese IPs onto the blockchain space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   **K-pop:** Hash's studio, Mood House, created K-pop idol groups (Triples and Emis) to demonstrate how fans can own NFTs or governance tokens of their favorite groups, shifting from passive consumption to active ownership and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. This model can also support funding new IPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>.

## Geographic Strategy: Bridging Asia and the West

Hash aims to be a bridge between the US and Asian markets in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.
*   **Asia (Korea, Vietnam, China, India, Turkey):** Characterized by a huge retail market and high speculation and liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
*   **West (US):** Known for large institutional capital and credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

Hash has expanded its presence with offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Singapore, India, and a growing focus on Japan and the Middle East (UAE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>. This strategy allows them to introduce US founders to Asian retail markets and Asian founders to US funds for credibility and capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. They particularly prefer Asian founders who can target both markets, as successful crypto projects historically have done so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Vision

One of Hash's worst decisions was over-investing during the 2021-2022 bull market, leading to saturated capacity and insufficient follow-up with all founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This highlights the [[Challenges and strategies in launching and scaling a crypto startup | challenges and strategies in launching and scaling a crypto startup]] in a rapidly expanding market.

Looking ahead, Hash believes the future bull market will involve the integration of the crypto economy with the real-world economy, with capital concentrating in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. The approval of BTC ETFs is seen as a first step in this institutional adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. While acknowledging the inevitability of market bubbles and crashes, Hash believes increased transparency can help prevent future incidents like Luna or FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

Hash also anticipates mass adoption through non-contentious methods, such as the integration of wallets into widely used social applications like Telegram or Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. This would simplify crypto transactions and onboarding for mainstream users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.

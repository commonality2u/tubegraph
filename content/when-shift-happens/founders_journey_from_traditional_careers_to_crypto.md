JP Thor, the founder of [[thorchain | Thorchain]], a decentralized exchange (DEX) recognized as one of the largest liquidity protocols globally with a market value exceeding $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, embarked on his entrepreneurial path in crypto after a distinct traditional career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His background as an Air Force pilot, flying fighters and bombers around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, shaped his approach to problem-solving and risk-taking.

## Early Life and Military Career

JP Thor's upbringing fostered an early sense of accelerated learning and a fact-oriented view of the world. Homeschooled, he was encouraged to "eat the math book" and rapidly progress through academic material, often outperforming his older siblings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This environment allowed him to form his own opinions, initially based on factual sources like encyclopedias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

His military career began early, joining the Air Force at 16, the youngest in his class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. His mission was to become a fighter pilot, test pilot, and eventually an astronaut, driven by a desire to explore the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. While excelling as a pilot, he found the Air Force environment too restrictive for his creative and "high agency" nature, preferring to push boundaries and experiment with the aircraft rather than follow strict protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. This disillusionment with organizational rigidity fueled his entrepreneurial spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.

## Transition to Crypto

JP Thor's entry into the crypto space began in 2013 when he discovered Bitcoin after hearing about a Bitcoin exchange pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:07">[02:40:07]</a>. He immediately invested, seeing it as a "once in a generation lifetime opportunity" and believing Bitcoin would reach a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:51">[02:40:51]</a>.

A pivotal moment that shaped his focus on decentralized solutions was his experience with centralized exchanges. After successfully moving his Bitcoin off Mt. Gox just before its hack in 2014, he later lost funds when another exchange, BTC.com, was shut down by the FBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>. This led him to "declare war on centralized exchanges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>.

He kept a close eye on the developing crypto landscape, witnessing the launch of Ethereum and participating in hackathons in 2016-2017, where he won prize money in ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>. He then tried to launch a decentralized marketplace, but realized that users primarily wanted to trade and that existing solutions like Atomic Swaps were too complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:30">[03:00:30]</a>.

## Founding Thorchain

This experience led him to the crucial realization that "it was all a game of liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:08">[02:58:08]</a>. Centralized exchanges were demanding exorbitant listing fees and market maker payments, bleeding project treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:18">[02:58:18]</a>. He envisioned a system for on-chain liquidity where users could easily swap assets like ETH to Bitcoin without complex multi-step processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:30">[03:00:30]</a>. This vision materialized into the "fruit basket" concept â€“ a liquidity pool where assets could be exchanged seamlessly and without insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>.

### Anonymous Building and Public Re-emergence

Thorchain was initially built under an anonymous identity, "Lena," a supposed junior developer in the Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:16">[03:42:16]</a>. This approach was intentional: Thor believed that for a project to achieve true decentralization and community ownership, its founder needed to be able to "shed the persona" and hand over control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:16">[03:42:16]</a>. This allowed Thorchain to become fully decentralized, with 100 to 120 nodes, making it impossible for any single individual, including him, to unilaterally control it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:16">[03:42:16]</a>.

Having achieved this decentralization, JP Thor re-emerged publicly, aiming to inspire other builders and bring attention back to decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:06">[04:31:06]</a>. His new mission is to "build in public" and "set the memes free," advocating for open-source development and sharing information to accelerate humanity's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:50">[04:26:50]</a>. He views wealth as a temporary "parking position" for time and effort, which should be reinvested into creating impactful "memes" (useful ideas and technologies) that upgrade humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:55">[04:52:55]</a>. This perspective highlights his [[transition_from_traditional_finance_to_crypto_and_the_founding_of_tezos | entrepreneurial journey and philosophy]].

### Current Ventures and Philosophy

JP Thor is now focused on making DeFi more accessible and secure. He is building "Stack Us Swap" (likely an interface or brand to abstract DeFi for 100 million users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:40">[01:59:40]</a> and "Voltis," a multi-factor crypto wallet designed to enhance self-custody security, viewing single-signature wallets and seed phrases as outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. His "Project Chaos" aims to inject excitement into DeFi through "vampire attacks" and protocol wars, believing that engaging "money games" can re-ignite attention for the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11">[02:22:11]</a>. His approach reflects deep [[longterm_strategies_and_philosophies_in_crypto_startups | insights on the entrepreneurial journey and challenges in the crypto space]], emphasizing speed, directness, and a relentless focus on creating useful memes that accelerate human progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

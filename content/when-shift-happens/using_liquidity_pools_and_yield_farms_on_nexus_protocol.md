Nexus Protocol launched the [[nexus_protocol_v1_vaults_launch | V1 version of their vaults]] on their platform, enabling users to engage in yield optimization and passive income generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The protocol aims to address the issue of [[understanding_anchor_protocol_and_its_liquidations | liquidations]] in the crypto space, particularly during bull markets, which can lead to significant portfolio impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## How Nexus Protocol Addresses Liquidations

Nexus Protocol seeks to mitigate liquidations by implementing vaults that facilitate [[yield_optimization_in_crypto_space | yield optimization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It allows users to operate with a higher total value locked (TVL) or collateral position than typically comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This is achieved because the Nexus Protocol oracle "front-runs" the [[role_of_anchor_token_in_yield_generation | Anchor protocol]] oracle, providing quicker, up-to-date pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This allows for background operations to optimize yields and loan-to-value (LTV) rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Accessing the Nexus Protocol Web App

To access the platform, users can visit nexusprotocol.app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. After connecting their wallet, a dashboard displays the current price of the PSI [[governance and decisionmaking on Nexus Protocol | governance token]], the total value locked (TVL), and circulating supply details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Vaults and Liquidity Pools

Nexus Protocol offers vaults for [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | bLuna]] (bonded Luna) and [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | bETH]] (bonded ETH), both derived from the [[role_of_anchor_token_in_yield_generation | Anchor protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Users can [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | bond Luna to get bLuna]] or [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | bond ETH (or staked ETH) to get bETH]] for use across the Terra ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The farming tab provides access to three [[decentralized_exchanges_and_liquidity_protocols | liquidity pools]]:
*   PSI-UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   nLuna-PSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   nETH-PSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>

The nETH-PSI pool currently offers the highest APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using the nETH-PSI Liquidity Pool

1.  **Acquire bETH**:
    *   bETH can be acquired directly on [[decentralized_exchanges_and_liquidity_protocols | TerraSwap]] using UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This method avoids the lock-up period associated with directly depositing into Anchor to get bETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   Search for "bETH" on TerraSwap and verify the contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   Swap UST for bETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Transaction fees on Terra are significantly low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

2.  **Deposit bETH into Nexus Protocol Vault**:
    *   Navigate to the "Vaults" section on the Nexus Protocol app and select the bETH vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   Click "Deposit" and confirm the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   Depositing bETH into the vault mints an equivalent amount of nETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

3.  **Add Liquidity to the nETH-PSI Pool**:
    *   Go to the "Farm" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   Select the "nETH-PSI" pool and click "Farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   When depositing assets into a [[decentralized_exchanges_and_liquidity_protocols | liquidity pool]], an equal dollar value of both tokens is required (e.g., 50% nETH and 50% PSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   Confirm the transaction to stake your nETH and PSI tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Earning Yield

Once staked, the platform displays the current Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and accrued rewards in PSI tokens, which continuously creep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. A common strategy involves taking earned PSI, splitting it, and reinvesting both parts into the liquidity pool to increase exposure to high APR rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The PSI-UST pool has consistently maintained an APR around 250% since its Token Generation Event (TGE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Withdrawing Liquidity

To withdraw assets:
1.  Go to the "Farm" tab and select "Withdraw" for the desired pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
2.  Confirm the withdrawal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
3.  Once withdrawn from the liquidity pool, users can then withdraw their bETH from the vault back into their wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, allowing them to sell it for UST or use it for other purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## PSI Token Staking and Governance

While not yet live at the time of recording, Nexus Protocol plans to allow users to [[governance and decisionmaking on Nexus Protocol | stake their Nexus governance token (PSI)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. APR details for staking will be published later on the [[governance and decisionmaking on Nexus Protocol | governance page]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. As a [[governance and decisionmaking on Nexus Protocol | governance token holder]], users will have the ability to vote on platform proposals, such as changes to vaults or the addition of new liquidity pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Jupiter is described as the most used decentralized trading platform on Solana and the largest Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:38">[01:47:38]</a>. Its overarching goal is to aggregate everything, bringing the entirety of the world's liquidity into one single place and making it easy to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:06">[01:39:06]</a>.

## The Jupe Airdrop: A Strategic Initiative

Jupiter conducted what is described as the largest airdrop to users in history, approving 700 million JUPE tokens per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:15">[03:49:15]</a>. This amounted to giving away approximately $700-800 million to users and stakers of the Jupiter product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:13">[03:52:13]</a>.

### Purpose Beyond "Free Money"
The primary idea behind the airdrop was not merely giving away money, but rather to meaningfully grow the community and give people a greater sense of ownership over the protocol's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:32">[09:16:32]</a>. Decentralization requires user buy-in, and apathy is seen as something that can kill communities and protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:06">[09:24:06]</a>. By distributing the JUPE token, Jupiter aims for recipients to stake it and participate in governance, fostering increased buy-in for the long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

This initiative is aimed at inviting the most active members of the community and existing users to become part of the community, ultimately helping to grow Jupiter's "baby" (project) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:49">[11:21:49]</a>.

### Scale and Impact
The first JUPE airdrop in 2023 was a significant catalyst for growth for both the product and the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:18">[10:02:18]</a>. The airdrop was designed to be as fair as possible to make as many people feel appreciated and part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:04">[08:33:04]</a>.

> "The idea is how do we actually meaningfully grow the community and give people more of a sense of ownership over the future of the protocol. Decentralization requires people to be bought in because the thing that kills protocols, the thing that kills communities is apathy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:23">[09:18:23]</a>

## Jupiter's Financial and Token Management Strategies

Jupiter's financial strategies are rooted in building a strong foundation and adding "tremendous amount of value" for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:09">[19:49:09]</a>. They prioritize ecosystem and user value over traditional business metrics like market size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:04">[19:34:04]</a>.

### The Tri-Billion Burn and Emission Adjustments
Jupiter burned over 3.5 billion worth of JUPE tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:48:00">[56:48:00]</a>. This decision was driven by the goal to make JUPE a more trusted token and to address community concerns about high emissions and high Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:29:00">[59:29:00]</a>.

The team voluntarily cut 600 million JUPE from their own allocation, and all future emissions were cut by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:00">[59:52:00]</a>. This strategic move, along with the team's commitment to holding most of their tokens, aims to create one of the healthiest emission strategies for a major project requiring funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25:00">[01:00:25:00]</a>.

### Jupe Token Buyback Program
Fifty percent of the protocol fees generated on Jupiter.ag will go into accumulating (not burning) the JUPE token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47:00">[01:12:47:00]</a>. This program creates a flywheel effect, where the product's success directly benefits token holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08:00">[01:13:08:00]</a>.

### Focus on User and Ecosystem Value
Jupiter believes that focusing on user value and building a strong foundation is crucial in the rapidly growing crypto industry, which has liberated finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. The project started with aggregation, then added a full-fledged spot product and the largest source of permanent liquidity on Solana via its PB stuff (possibly referring to Perpetual Futures or similar liquid staking pools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>. Recently, Jupiter embarked on a token initiative to create the most comprehensive and safe token database in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Community and Governance at the Core
Jupiter's governance process involves collecting thousands of pieces of verified feedback through Discord, forums, and Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. This collaborative approach allows for strong opinions to be voiced, ultimately leading to the best possible outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. An example of this was the successful community vote on the token allocation numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

### The Catstanbul Conference
Jupiter hosted its first-ever community conference, Catstanbul, in Istanbul, Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Despite initial expectations of around 500-600 attendees, approximately 1,700 people attended, flying in from various countries like New Zealand, Argentina, China, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The high attendance demonstrated a strong community energy and belief in Jupiter's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01:00">[01:31:01:00]</a>.

The conference showcased the project's ability to pull off an event of this scale, emphasizing the vibrant and dedicated nature of Jupiter's community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54:00">[01:00:54:00]</a>. The choice of Istanbul was partly due to its informal nickname "Catstanbul" and the project's cat-centric meme culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Vision and Future of Jupiter
Jupiter's overall strategy can be summarized in three words: Aggregate, Align, Accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### The "Aggregate, Align, Accelerate" Philosophy
*   **Aggregate**: Primarily focuses on the product side, like platforms aggregating tokens to offer the best prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Jup.net is designed to aggregate all chains, identity, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Align**: Achieved through the JUPE token, which helps align incentives across different projects and the DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This also involves structuring participation and fee structures to benefit all partners and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Accelerate**: Involves community work, fostering "founder energy" through work groups and the DAO, creating content, and collaborating with creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. The aim is to dramatically and permanently change the adoption curve of crypto technology by making products easier and safer to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Jupiter's long-term vision is to change the entire face of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, recognizing that the crypto industry is the fastest growing in human history due to its liberation of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

### Decentralized Exchanges vs. Centralized Exchanges
Jupiter's role in the Trump coin launch demonstrated that Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and on-chain infrastructure can compete with Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. DEXs offer instant, 24/7 availability globally, making them essential for onboarding more people into the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

The ability to conduct large-scale launches on-chain without technical issues, coupled with the shift of market share towards on-chain platforms, marks a significant change in the crypto landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Jupiter's goal is not to eliminate centralization but to offer a superior, decentralized alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions
Jupiter focuses on [[strategic_partnerships_and_market_positioning_of_jupiter | strategic partnerships]] and acquisitions that create synergy, rather than dominating the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

*   **Moonshot Acquisition**: Jupiter acquired a majority stake in Moonshot, the platform that provided the "buy button" for the Trump coin website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This acquisition was based on Moonshot's founders' talent, market understanding, and shared values, demonstrating Jupiter's willingness to make "counter-intuitive" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **AI Partnership**: Jupiter is co-investing in open-source AI with partners like AZ, leveraging expertise in areas where Jupiter might not have a core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Approach to Celebrity Token Launches

Jupiter has seen significant interest from celebrities and personalities looking to launch their own tokens following the success of the Trump coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

### Lessons from Trump and Hado
The key differences between successful (Trump) and unsuccessful (Hado) celebrity token launches boil down to a few factors:

*   **Crypto-Native Brand Credibility**: The most crucial factor is how much credibility and resonance a celebrity's brand has within the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Famous individuals like rappers might have worldwide fame but lack a core crypto following, leading to short-term speculation rather than sustained value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Trump's success is attributed to his perceived pro-crypto policies and meme appeal within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Meme Game vs. Short-Term P&L**: The crypto community needs to view a famous brand as a long-term presence in crypto, not just a one-day profit opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Trust and Patience**: Celebrities without established crypto trust should be patient and spend time engaging with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. In crypto, "perception becomes reality," so a lack of trust can quickly lead to a project being labeled a "rug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

### Building Crypto-Native Brand Equity
Jupiter emphasizes that building trust requires patience and spending time within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. The platform offers tools and services to assist token creators in ensuring legitimacy and providing certainty to token buyers (referred to as "CAT" - Certainty, Alignment, Transparency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

Jupiter views itself as a technology provider, not an advisor for project success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Their role is to ensure the technical infrastructure works well for token launches, akin to a gym providing working machines rather than personal trainers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. They believe that ultimately, the success of a project depends on having tokens in the hands of long-term believers, which can be fostered through transparency and avoiding short-term "pump and dump" strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

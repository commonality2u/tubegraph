Anchor Protocol is a platform that aims to provide a stable, high-yield savings product for stablecoins. Many users in the DeFi and Terra space utilize this platform, perhaps without fully understanding its underlying mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The protocol's white paper contains detailed information on how it operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As of November 23, 2021, Anchor Protocol aims to pay its users approximately 20% APR in interest on their stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, and this article will detail how it generates and sustains this [[highyield_stablecoin_interest | high yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Mechanics of Yield Generation

Anchor's ability to generate and pay out [[yield_in_crypto_vs_capital_gains | yield]] stems from two primary sources: the interest earned on collateral deposited by borrowers and the interest paid by borrowers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Borrower Collateral
Users who wish to borrow UST (TerraUSD) on Anchor Protocol must provide collateral, typically in the form of heavily over-collateralized assets like bETH (bonded Ethereum) and bLUNA (bonded Luna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Anchor then utilizes these deposited assets to earn [[yield_in_crypto_vs_capital_gains | yield]] in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Based on Lido's rates as an example (as of November 23, 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>:
*   **bLUNA Collateral:** Anchor Protocol held 2.76 billion USTs worth of bLUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Lido Finance paid 6.3% on this, generating 173.8 million UST for Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **bETH Collateral:** Anchor held 373 million USTs worth of bETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Lido's rate for ETH was 4.9%, generating 18.3 million UST for Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Borrowing Interest
In addition to earnings from collateral, Anchor also generates revenue from the interest paid by borrowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The total amount of UST borrowed against collateral was 1.21 billion UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Multiplying this by the borrow APR (which can fluctuate) results in a significant revenue stream for Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. At the time of analysis, this amounted to 283.14 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Calculating Sustainability
To understand Anchor's sustainability, one must compare the amount it needs to pay out to depositors against the revenue it generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Payout Requirements
The total deposits in Anchor Protocol were 2.42 billion UST, and the current payout rate was 19.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This means Anchor needed to generate 471.4 million UST to cover its payout obligations (19.8% of 2.42 billion UST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Total Revenue Generated
Summing the revenue streams:
*   Earnings from bLUNA collateral: 173.8 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
*   Earnings from bETH collateral: 18.3 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
*   Earnings from borrowed funds interest: 283.14 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>

This totals 475.24 million UST in revenue generated by Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Revenue vs. Payout
Subtracting the payout required (471.4 million UST) from the revenue generated (475.24 million UST) leaves a remainder of 3.84 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This indicates that Anchor Protocol was generating 3.84 million UST above its payout requirements at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## The Yield Reserve
The surplus 3.84 million UST generated by Anchor goes directly into its yield reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This reserve is crucial for counteracting any imbalances in the platform or covering shortfalls when the borrow APR is insufficient to meet the required payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. As of the video's recording, the yield reserve stood at approximately 75 million UST and was consistently growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Monitoring this value is important as it reflects the health and sustainability of the Anchor ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Role of the Anchor Token (ANC)
The [[role_of_anchor_token_in_yield_generation | Anchor Token]] (ANC) plays a significant role in incentivizing borrowing on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. ANC tokens are distributed to offset the borrow APR, sometimes resulting in a net positive APR where borrowers are actually *paid* to borrow money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This distribution serves as an incentivization program designed to encourage users to adopt the Anchor platform until the token distribution concludes at the end of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Anchor's Position in the Terra Ecosystem
Anchor Protocol has strategically positioned itself as a fundamental component of the Terra network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This has led to numerous projects developing on top of or integrating with Anchor, facilitating real-world adoption and cross-chain interconnectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Orion Protocol:** Uses Anchor as its backbone to earn [[yield_in_crypto_vs_capital_gains | yields]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. It allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens and earn [[yield_in_crypto_vs_capital_gains | yield]] through Anchor on their behalf via smart contracts, providing exposure to non-native savings platforms for users on Polygon, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Orca from Kajira:** Developed a method for retail users to participate in Anchor's liquidations contract, which was previously more accessible to "whales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. More information on this specific [[earning_interest_on_aust_bids_on_kajiras_orca | yield earning strategy]] can be found in dedicated videos about Orca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Cash Defi:** Aims to bring stablecoins to a wider audience by offering savings accounts with IBANs, sort codes, and debit cards, allowing users to spend UST in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Conclusion on Sustainability
Based on the calculations and the continuous growth of its yield reserve, Anchor Protocol appears capable of sustaining its approximately 20% [[highyield_stablecoin_interest | stablecoin yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Its increasing adoption, as evidenced by new wallets created daily on Terra Station, further supports its ability to maintain these attractive interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Caveat
It is important to note that the figures presented are based on calculations from various sources (Lido Finance, Anchor itself, token prices) as of November 23, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. These numbers are subject to change on a daily basis due to fluctuations in deposits, withdrawals, collateral values, and ANC token price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, this analysis provides a fundamental understanding of Anchor's [[yield_optimization_in_crypto_space | yield generation]] and its potential for continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

The concept of "zero culture" in cryptocurrency is proposed as a vital counter-culture to the prevailing "moon only culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. This philosophy emphasizes **zero expectations, zero promises, and zero ego**, advocating for "pure zero IQ participation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. It promotes a mindset that thrives regardless of market conditions, whether "green candles in hand or red candles in the ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## Why Embrace Zero Culture?

The "moon only culture" fosters high expectations, which inevitably lead to low resilience. When these expectations are not met, "hearts get broken and resilience gets broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. Embracing a zero mindset can help participants and the industry avoid "disappointment and failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. By not promising the moon, it allows for a more stoic approach to market fluctuations and personal investment journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.

## Resilience and Pain as Teachers

Resilience is paramount in the volatile crypto industry. As NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang noted, "people with high expectations have very low resilience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Suffering and pain are crucial for building this resilience. Just as a baby learns not to touch hot water by getting burned, or an athlete builds strength through struggle, entrepreneurs learn through failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. This "post-traumatic growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a> teaches what *not* to do, leading to an internal, healthier motivation not to repeat mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.

Instead of trying to "sound like you are doing something great," it is better to live life, state intentions, and "see where it goes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This mindset applies to business as well; "VCs don't fund you based on a vision" but "based on who is funding you" and convincing people that you "know where you're going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Goals will always change, especially in crypto, so being self-aware and confident in one's ability to navigate is more important than a rigid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## The Redwood Analogy for Projects

Founders and projects can learn from the giant redwood trees in Sequoia National Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. These trees thrive through forest fires, which clear out pests, weeds, and debris, allowing more light and nutrients to reach them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. Similarly, "fires" (market downturns) in crypto sweep away "bad characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a> and allow strong projects to emerge.

To survive these "fires" and become like a redwood, projects need three qualities:
1.  **Fire Resistance:** Being "downturn resistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>, often achieved through resilient operational models.
2.  **Attention/Brand Presence:** Having an ecosystem that needs the project, so it doesn't die from temporary setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.
3.  **Liquidity:** Strong capital flows to withstand market shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

This teaches that instead of fearing market downturns, projects should understand they can be beneficial if they survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>, fostering resilience and understanding that "this too shall pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

## PVP vs. PPP: Shifting the Industry Mindset

The crypto industry is largely seen as a Player vs. Player (PVP) game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>, characterized by distrust and a focus on "getting in early and dump[ing] on someone else who is late to the party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. This is analogous to Counter-Strike, where "I kill you, you kill me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a> and everyone's finger is on the sell button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

However, the industry's growth to a $2.5 trillion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> was driven by projects that fostered a Player-Player-Player (PPP) environment. PPP is like a garden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a> where all participants work together to cultivate growth. Projects like Bitcoin became trillion-dollar protocols because of a large [[the_role_of_community_in_crypto_businesses | community]] of people who built for it, invested in it, and evangelized it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

To shift from PVP to PPP, the industry must:
1.  **Be Comfortable with Failure:** Recognize that downturns (red candles) reveal "who is PPP" and "the gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>.
2.  **Stop Accepting Bad Behaviors:** Refuse to enable behaviors like influencers dumping tokens or accepting "poisonous characters" merely for temporary pumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.
3.  **Cultivate Higher Resilience:** Overcoming the fear of downturns and refusing to give into temporary pumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

A zero culture mindset directly supports a PPP environment by removing unrealistic expectations and encouraging long-term, collaborative growth rather than short-term gains at others' expense. This also combats the perception that crypto is an "insider game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>, similar to traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>.

## Money as Energy and Memes

The speaker defines money as "energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>, specifically "human energy" and "human conviction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. Anyone can create money if they gather the right kind of energy and conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. All coins are "meme coins" because a meme is "something that everyone agrees on and understands and agrees on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. Gold, Bitcoin, and USD are all backed by fundamental memes that a critical mass of people believe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

While utility contributes to a coin's meme, the underlying meme is at the heart of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. This means a project's "fundamentals" primarily give it a non-zero value, but the "premium on the top" is derived from attention and the strength of its meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. The concern that focusing on memes over utility could hinder advancement is addressed by the idea that utility *supports* the meme, creating a "virtuous cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>. Anything that makes people happy can be considered utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.

## Attention Without Promises

In a world where attention is a powerful force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>, a zero culture aims to rally attention without promising the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. Instead of seeking "certainty, dreams, and hopes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a> that moon boys seek, the focus is on doing what is needed, having fun, and working as a [[the_role_of_community_in_crypto_businesses | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. This approach aims to be more sustainable and less prone to the disappointment caused by unmet hype.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the embrace of zero culture – with its emphasis on zero expectations, promises, and ego – is presented as a path toward a more resilient and sustainable cryptocurrency industry. By prioritizing authentic conviction and community collaboration over short-term gains and unrealistic hype, the industry can better navigate its inherent cycles and build long-lasting value.

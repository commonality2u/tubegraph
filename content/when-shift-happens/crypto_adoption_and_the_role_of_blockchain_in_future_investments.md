Remy Teto, co-founder of Real Vision and head of research analysis at Global Macro Investors (GMI), discusses the Exponential Age framework and its implications for [[Crypto Adoption and the Role of Blockchain in Future Investments | crypto investments]], highlighting the rapid adoption of new technologies and the pivotal role of network effects in future wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Exponential Age Framework

The Exponential Age framework, developed by GMI, is crucial for understanding why investments in [[Crypto Adoption and the Role of Blockchain in Future Investments | crypto]] and other technologies built on network effects represent the significant opportunity for the next 10 to 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many charts began to show exponential growth, prompting GMI to analyze everything in log scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This revealed that everything is now moving at a different speed, driven by the compounding effect of technological evolution over the past two to three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

The framework is divided into two parts:

### Structure Part
This involves foundational technologies that enable new developments:
*   **SpaceX and Satellite Deployment**: The exponential growth of space technology, particularly SpaceX contracts with the U.S. government, promises faster internet access to remote areas and emerging countries, creating an "insane network effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **5G Networks**: Continued growth in 5G, with 6G already in development, further enhances reach and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Declining Computing Power Costs**: Over the last 20 years, the price of computing power has essentially fallen to zero, enabling many technologies that were previously too expensive or impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Edge Computing**: This new development, similar to [[the_role_of_blockchain_in_future_wealth_creation | blockchain's]] distributed computing power, is expected to create another exponential growth curve, surpassing even Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Application Part
These are sectors impacted by the structural advancements:
*   **Connected Devices**: By 2025, an estimated 80 billion connected devices (about 10 per person) are expected worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   **Data Consumption and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: These devices will consume vast amounts of data, enabling the exponential growth of AI, as seen in patent trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   **Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Autonomous Driving**: Enabled by faster networks and data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **3D Printing**: Rapid prototyping capabilities reduce time and complexity, changing manufacturing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**: Expected significant growth in sales, exemplified by Facebook's acquisition of Oculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Genetics Mapping and Healthcare**: Advancements in technology have drastically reduced the cost of genetics mapping, leading to new medical breakthroughs like mRNA vaccines, fundamentally changing healthcare and lifespan expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## [[Crypto Adoption and the Role of Blockchain in Future Investments | Crypto Adoption Tracking Internet Growth]]
The adoption of [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto | crypto]] directly tracks the adoption of the internet in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Currently, [[Crypto Adoption and the Role of Blockchain in Future Investments | crypto adoption]] is at a stage equivalent to internet adoption in 1997, which was the very beginning of its widespread use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This suggests significant future growth. Based on growth rates, the number of [[Crypto Adoption and the Role of Blockchain in Future Investments | crypto users]] is projected to reach one billion by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

The acceleration of [[the_role_of_blockchain_in_future_wealth_creation | blockchain]] adoption is attributed to the prior development of the internet and mobile technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Initiatives like Facebook's Diem could instantly bring billions of people into the [[crypto_and_blockchains_role_in_global_finance | crypto ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Emerging markets, with their young populations and high Facebook usage, are expected to be key drivers of this adoption, representing a significant future revenue opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

## Implications for Investing in the Exponential Age
Our brains struggle to comprehend exponential curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>, making models and charts essential for visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. The combination of past and new technologies means the future, even in 10 years, is beyond our current comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

For investors, while technology-focused companies trade at high multiples and offer no dividends, including them in a portfolio is strategically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. The massive deployment of money by central banks globally has debased currencies, leading to asset price inflation and wage deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. This phenomenon has caused a "massive distortion" in asset classes, where those exposed to these assets benefit, while normal people with stable wages lose purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. This further widens the wealth gap, as seen in the exponential growth of billionaires' net worth compared to the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

[[Investment Opportunities in Crypto | Crypto]] and technology themes are seen as the "opportunity of our generation" for millennials and Gen Z to build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

## Remy's Journey into Crypto

Remy's first encounter with [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto | crypto]] was in March 2013, when Bitcoin was at $53 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. He initially opened an account with Mt. Gox, which was later hacked, and he gave up on it due to the painful due diligence process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. GMI made its first trade recommendation for clients to buy Bitcoin at $212 in less than a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

In 2014, GMI presented on the "digitalization of everything," which Remy now equates to NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. While they moved away from Bitcoin around 2017, they returned to it in 2020, buying back when it was around $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. This return was driven by the network effect concept, especially observed in Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.

DeFi Summer in 2020 was a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. After Delphie Digital's CEO explained the DeFi ecosystem, Remy went "down the rabbit hole," realizing its game-changing potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. His early experience included issues with gas fees and getting scammed, which he considers his "learning curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. He later focused on single projects, particularly ThorChain (RUNE) in January, recognizing its decentralized exchange aspect as a "no-brainer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

Remy believes that [[the_future_of_the_crypto_market | the future of crypto]] is multi-chain, with each chain playing a different role in the vast ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

## Network Effects Applied to Crypto

GMI uses various charts to illustrate network effects in [[the_future_of_the_crypto_market | crypto]]:
*   **Address Growth Comparison**: By re-basing the first day of activity as "day one," a comparison of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Terra (Luna) addresses shows that newer chains, like Ethereum and especially Terra, are growing faster than Bitcoin did at similar stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.
*   **Market Cap Growth Acceleration**: To reach a $50 billion market cap, Bitcoin took 2,200 days, Ethereum achieved it in about a third of that time, and Solana in even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. This indicates that the market is maturing, and people are more quickly identifying opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin Price Cycle Comparison**: Comparing Bitcoin's current cycle to its 2012-2013 and 2017 cycles reveals similar human behavior patterns driven by fear and greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. However, the current cycle is fundamentally different due to increased utility (e.g., El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as legal tender), higher trading volumes, and the introduction of ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. This suggests the current cycle could "blow up completely" past previous projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
*   **Ethereum Price Action vs. Bitcoin (2011-2019)**: When comparing Ethereum's price action against Bitcoin's historical performance (2011-2019) from the point where each asset surpassed one million wallet addresses, a strong correlation is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. The emergence of [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]] has been a "game-changer" for Ethereum, alongside developments like Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **Solana vs. Ethereum Price Action**: Solana's growth trajectory mirrors Ethereum's, suggesting similar exponential potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   **Total Crypto Market Cap and Altcoin Market Cap (Excluding BTC/ETH)**: The total crypto market cap has consistently bounced at expected support levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. The altcoin market cap (excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) is also poised for a "very big run," fueled by positive news, regulatory clarity in the U.S., and the growth of projects like Solana, Polkadot, Terra, and Avalanche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.

## Remy's Personal Investment Philosophy and Allocation

Remy currently has 100% of his portfolio allocated to [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. He made this decision about two months prior, recognizing the "once in a generation opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. His current allocation is 95% in Luna and 5% in DOT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. He holds "zero Bitcoin" and does not hold Ethereum at this time (though he holds significant call options on it), believing the risk/reward is not currently in Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.

His investment strategy involves focusing on three key positions, avoiding small market cap coins, and sticking to predetermined targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. After the bull run, he plans to convert much of his holdings into UST (Terra's stablecoin) and stake it in Anchor Protocol to generate passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. He also plans to eventually convert some to Bitcoin for purchasing power preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>. He views [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto | crypto]] as a new asset class at its beginning, with the potential to evolve into a fundamental global financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

Regarding potential invalidations of this exponential growth, Remy believes it's unlikely to be stopped, comparing it to the unstoppable adoption of air travel despite early crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>. While there might be crashes and market cleanups, the underlying tech evolution will continue, making it a "no-brainer" for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

## Deep Dive into Terra (Luna/UST)

Remy's interest in Terra began when Mike Novogratz tweeted about being an early investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>. Initially skeptical due to the aggressive "lunatics" community, he later explored Terra after recognizing a pattern of new chains outperforming established ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum due to lower costs and newer technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. He was particularly drawn to Terra's use of Rust coding, similar to Solana, and was "mind-blown" by its ecosystem just before the Columbus-5 upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.

Key aspects that solidified his belief in Terra:
*   **Talented Founders**: Conversations with founders of major Terra protocols revealed serious and smart individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.
*   **UST-Luna Relationship**: The beautifully built, symbiotic relationship between the UST stablecoin and Luna (the volatile asset) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.
*   **Practical Applications**: Terra's applications, such as Anchor Protocol (offering ~20% yield on UST) and Mirror Protocol (synthetic assets), are practical fintech solutions that are easy for end-users to understand and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.
*   **Closed-Loop Ecosystem**: Terra is building a complete ecosystem where users can earn yield, buy tokens, and spend their crypto in real life via debit cards and integrated accounts (e.g., Shy, Alice, Cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. This "closed circle" removes common barriers for mainstream adoption, making [[Crypto Adoption and the Role of Blockchain in Future Investments | crypto exposure]] accessible to newbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.
*   **UST Adoption**: UST's adoption has been outperforming other stablecoins, and its cross-chain integration (IBC, Wormhole) is expected to drive massive demand, positively impacting Luna's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>. Do Kwon, Terra's founder, forecasts UST to reach $10 billion by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.
*   **Growth Potential**: Given Terra's current relatively small market cap compared to other chains and the numerous protocols launching in the next six months, a significant increase in market cap is expected due to demand and supply shock for Luna and UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. This could potentially lead Luna to a peak of $400 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>.

The main risk for Terra is a de-peg or bank run, but Remy notes that founders are actively working to strengthen the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. He is even considering building solutions on Terra, such as an on-off ramp for pension funds to access the system safely, and a play-to-earn game utilizing [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]] and AR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

## [[Investing in blockchain gaming and its potentials | Gaming, Metaverse, and the Future]]

Remy is particularly passionate about the metaverse and play-to-earn gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. The metaverse is seen as an extension of communities where people can meet and interact, evolving towards "Ready Player One" style experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:44">[01:33:44]</a>. High-quality metaverse development is anticipated, with companies like Epic Games building impressive platforms using Unreal Engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>.

This new digital realm is creating an entire new economy and business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>. For example, new jobs for 3D builders are emerging, and DAOs are enabling renting virtual land for experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a>. The "play-to-earn" model, as demonstrated by Axie Infinity, is particularly impactful for emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:17">[01:36:17]</a>. People in these regions can earn more money by playing games in the metaverse than working traditional factory jobs, which will be further enabled by improved internet access via satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[01:35:41]</a>.

Regarding large tech companies like Facebook in the metaverse, Remy notes Facebook's rebranding and aims to be a key player due to its network effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>. However, he believes the metaverse should be a "multiverse" and not dominated by a single big tech entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>. While big tech has capabilities, their centralized, profit-making nature is opposite to the decentralized principles of many protocols, which are inherently "much better for everyone involved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:48">[01:39:48]</a>. Remy acknowledges a need for both decentralized and centralized elements in the future, but prefers not to see Facebook dominate due to concerns about business motives and data usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:15">[01:40:15]</a>.

Beyond [[impact_of_technological_advancements_and_market_patterns_on_crypto_investments | technological advancements]], Remy is most excited about improvements in genetics and healthcare in the next 5-10 years, particularly regarding longevity and quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>.

Julian, the founder and chief designer at Black Paris, a brand recognized for its distinctive all-black aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, shares his [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | entrepreneurial journey]], highlighting the significant [[challenges_and_solutions_in_entrepreneurship | challenges]] he faced and the mindset he adopted to build a successful global brand.

## Early Life and Introduction to Business

Julian was born into a loving family, but his parents were "very elitist," emphasizing strong academics and top universities, especially for him as the eldest son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. This upbringing instilled a drive to excel and a fear of failure, as failure was seen as a "shame" by his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

His [[career_journey_from_musician_to_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurial journey]] began at age 12, when he started building websites, learning foundational programming languages like PHP, SQL, HTML, and CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. He developed websites for friends of his parents, which provided his first contact with earning money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

> "My vision was not to work for someone. That was exactly what happened in my mind. I never saw myself working for someone else. I have like a problem with authority... I need to be in control." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>

He was even kicked out of kindergarten at six years old due to fighting and spitting on people, showcasing an early rebellious streak and aversion to authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.

He pursued business engineering at Solvay Business School in Brussels, enjoying the scientific aspects like mathematics and statistics, but doing only the minimum in subjects he disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. During his studies, he launched an application called "Moon movie," which matched movies to a user's mood based on big data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>. This venture gained good traffic and even led to a national TV show appearance in Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>.

After college, Julian founded a web design agency, Anor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>. This agency became very profitable due to low overhead, allowing him to afford a Porsche 911 at 22-23 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>. However, working with large corporations like LG, Huawei, and Samsung became creatively stifling due to rigid guidelines and bureaucratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>.

## Founding Black: A Personal and Business Transformation

Black was born during a "very dark time" in Julian's life, coinciding with a period of depression around age 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. He found that in every sadness, there is "beautiful creativity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This period of [[personal_reflections_on_entrepreneurship_and_mindset | sadness]] and a difficult breakup from a five-year relationship motivated him to build Black Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:58:00">[59:58:00]</a>.

The concept began on Instagram where he posted "all black everything" designs, such as a black Starbucks or McDonald's logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. This concept went viral, leading him to acquire the "black" Instagram handle and evolve it into a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>. Initially selling accessories and clothes, Black has expanded into a lifestyle brand with home collections, restaurants, and even hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges

Julian's journey has been marked by significant [[challenges_and_solutions_in_entrepreneurship | challenges]]:

### Mental Health Struggles
He experienced severe anxiety and depression, particularly around age 19-20, triggered by co-founder issues in a previous venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Anxiety manifested as physical symptoms like a blocked stomach, fast heart rate, and trouble sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
Julian's approach to mental health involves "tricking his brain" and using negative energy to push himself positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. He believes everything is in the mind and problems should be tackled from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

### Co-founder Issues
Julian faced [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_financial_investment_and_entrepreneurship | co-founder issues]] in his earlier ventures, stating that ego and insecurities can lead to business failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. He learned that a company needs a clear leader, ideally a sole founder who makes the final decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. While he is a co-founder in other projects, he ensures his main activity, Black, remains under his singular vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

### Social Media and Public Perception
Social media played a crucial role in Black's early success, enabling viral marketing and direct market insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. However, Julian also recognized the pressure to maintain an image for credibility, posting "money inspirational" content even if it sometimes went against his personal values of authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. He eventually reduced his personal activity on Instagram, realizing the pursuit of external validation negatively impacted his mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

## Business Philosophy and Growth

### Lean Operations and Data-Driven Decisions
Julian advocates for a lean business model, minimizing fixed costs by outsourcing development and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. This approach allowed him to sleep well at night without the financial stress of large overheads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>. He stresses the importance of understanding every aspect of the business before outsourcing, as exemplified by his mentor, the founder of Checkout.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:10">[01:46:10]</a>.

He employs a data-driven approach, testing product ideas on social media before full production to confirm demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>. This minimizes risk and ensures products align with customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.

### The Role of Ego
Julian has a nuanced view on ego, believing it can be a "big solution" as it fosters self-belief and enables decision-making without external influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. It can also drive perfectionism. However, he acknowledges that ego can be "bad" if it prevents trying new things for fear of looking foolish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. The key is finding the right balance and being impartial with oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>.

### Innovation and Web3
Black has expanded into digital markets, selling digital products like iPhone icons and photo presets, generating significant revenue with minimal costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. Julian personally learned 3D design to create NFTs, launching the "Dark Mode" series and the "Black Genesis" collection, which offers benefits like store discounts and event access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>.
Black recently signed a collaboration with PSG, involving both physical merchandise and NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>. Julian also partners with crypto experts for advice, as crypto is not his primary field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:24">[02:05:24]</a>. These [[insights_on_the_entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges_in_the_crypto_space | ventures]] demonstrate Black's commitment to digital innovation.

### Future Goals
Black is currently valued between $80 million and $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Julian's goal is to reach a billion-dollar valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. The company is profitable and entirely family-owned, giving Julian full control over decisions without external investor pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>. His sisters also work in the company and hold shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. The challenge now is deciding whether to grow slowly organically or seek significant investment to accelerate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Learnings

> "The faster you try, the faster you fail. The faster you fail, the faster you learn. The faster you get to success." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:08">[02:13:08]</a>

Julian believes that true luxury is a concept invented for the poor, used to prove oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. Having achieved success, he no longer feels the need to wear high-end brands, preferring simpler attire like a Zara t-shirt as a "flex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of self-love and confidence, stating that everyone has a hidden potential that needs to be unlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. His [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | personal experiences]] have shaped his resilient and confident approach.

His [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_overcoming_industry_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]] has shown him the importance of simply "trying." By starting young and embracing mistakes, he believes he achieved success faster than if he had waited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:52">[02:12:52]</a>. He attributes his confidence and ability to learn quickly to his mindset, trusting his intuition and making decisions based on his own knowledge and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

The gaming industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving from traditional Web2 models to more decentralized Web3 approaches, largely driven by the integration of cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This shift addresses long-standing challenges in monetization, user acquisition, and creator engagement.

## The Sandbox: A Case Study in Web3 Adoption

The Sandbox, co-founded and CEO by Sebastian Borget, is a unicorn online gaming platform that offers an immersive gaming experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Initially launched in 2011 as a mobile game, it allowed users to create 2D games, music, and pixel art, achieving 40 million downloads and 70 million player-made creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Despite its initial success, The Sandbox faced challenges in retaining creators and sharing revenue with them due to limitations of traditional mobile platforms like App Store and Google Play Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. These platforms took significant fees and lacked mechanisms for developers to send payments back to individual users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

In 2017, The Sandbox team discovered blockchain technology through "CryptoKitties," which utilized NFTs for virtual cats that could be traded outside the game on marketplaces like OpenSea using crypto payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This discovery provided a solution for creator monetization, leading The Sandbox to transition to blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

The Sandbox now boasts 5.7 million user accounts with wallets, over 800 partners worldwide, and 400 major brands, with Asia representing 35% of its players, creators, brands, and land owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. The platform continues to develop, with plans for a beta phase this year, the launch of a DAO for governance, and a public 1.0 mobile version next year, aiming for accelerated growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## Challenges of Web2 Gaming

Traditional Web2 gaming models, particularly free-to-play mobile games, face significant challenges:
*   **High Marketing Costs**: Studios need to spend "seven to eight figures in marketing" to enter the top-grossing charts, which have remained stagnant for years with no new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Inefficient User Acquisition**: Rising user acquisition costs (CPI) are exacerbated by new privacy laws that limit targeting specific user demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Decreasing Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Economic factors like inflation mean people are spending less on entertainment, leading to lower LTV for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Profitability Issues**: The traditional CPI vs. LTV equation is becoming increasingly challenging, leading to widespread layoffs in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Web3 as a Solution and Opportunity

[[The evolution of the gaming industry through blockchain | Web3]] offers a new recipe for the gaming industry by reinventing business models and distributing value more equitably among players, developers, and platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Key Web3 Benefits:
*   **Fairer Value Distribution**: Allows players to become stakeholders in the game economy through ownership and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **New Monetization Models**:
    *   **Royalties**: Developers can take a small fee on every transaction of limited, scarce content, maximizing value over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   **Airdrops**: Distribute content or tokens for free initially to drive community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Community Involvement**: Encourages community participation and co-creation with brands, leading to a more diverse content ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **True Digital Ownership**: [[Digital Asset Policies and the Future of Web 3 Gaming | Ownership of digital assets]] allows users to retain value from their time and work spent online, which was not possible in Web2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.

> "Web3 brings a new solution, brings an opportunity to reinvent the model to distribute the value between the different actors of the value chain like the players, the developers, and the platform form in a more fair way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>

While established Web2 players are hesitant to disrupt their current profitable models, new studios and creators are more agile and better suited to experiment with Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Organizations like the Blockchain Game Alliance are educating the industry on how blockchain can empower video games and drive new use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## The Role of NFTs and Cryptocurrencies

[[The Role of NFTs and Meme Coins | NFTs]] are considered "far from dead" and are seen as a "store of culture," akin to how cryptocurrencies are a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. The market for NFT trading remains active, though it has shifted between marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

NFTs can represent various asset classes:
*   Art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>
*   Virtual land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>
*   Avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>
*   Game items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>
*   Profile pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>
*   Music or sound files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>

The utility of NFTs and their connection to a strong team and community are crucial for long-term value, rather than solely focusing on floor price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

### Digital Identity and Avatars
A significant aspect of NFTs in gaming is their role in [[nfts_and_their_cultural_significance | digital identity]]. Studies show that over 54% of people with avatars on platforms like Roblox, Fortnite, or The Sandbox feel more themselves than in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. This is because the metaverse allows individuals to choose their identity, free from real-world societal pressures and judgments based on appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

Digital identity in the metaverse can evolve, does not age, and can be augmented with new emotes and animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. NFTs play a central role, with avatars serving as entry points into the metaverse, reflecting an individual's chosen identity and community affiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

### Creating Valuable NFT Communities
There isn't a single way to build a valuable NFT community. Approaches vary:
*   **Pudgy Penguins**: Known for its friendly, inclusive, and balanced community, successfully bridging to Web2 by launching physical toys at Walmart, attracting a broad audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)**: Initiated a significant cultural movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   **The Sandbox**: Focuses on creators and user-generated content, leveraging brands, and adopting a cultural, inclusive, and global approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

The ability to prove actions and contributions on-chain, such as time spent playing a game or leveling up an avatar, builds an on-chain reputation that can be valuable for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

### NFT Projects Launching Tokens
NFT projects are increasingly launching tokens to create more diversified economies beyond just asset trading and royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Tokens can:
*   **Reward NFT Holders**: Incentivize active participation and loyalty within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>.
*   **Increase Liquidity**: Tokens often have more liquidity than NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   **Enable DeFi Integration**: Can be staked or exchanged within decentralized finance ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Build Granular Economies**: Allow for the development of complex economies of service and activity on top of asset ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>.

Airdropping tokens to holders of top NFT collections is a new user acquisition model, redirecting value from traditional advertising platforms to the end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. This means the value goes directly to the community, who then decide how to use or hold the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.

## The Future of Gaming

The gaming space is poised for continued evolution, with [[impact_of_crypto_gaming_on_adoption_and_economy | blockchain gaming]] expected to be a primary driver of adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. Key predictions and beliefs include:
*   **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: There is "no future of gaming without user generated content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Any successful game will empower users to create and contribute content, with mechanisms to reward them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.
*   **Blended Worlds**: The physical and virtual worlds will become increasingly blended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
*   **Recognition of Digital Creators**: A global recognition of digital creators and the income they earn from creating content in virtual worlds is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.
*   [[The Role of NFTs and Meme Coins | Meme Coins]] and [[The potential and challenges of tokens and NFTs in economics | Social Tokens]]: The emergence of meme coins and social tokens, like the `SEB` token, represents new experimental ways to engage communities and create on-chain proof of interactions, potentially driving adoption similar to how pop culture originates from grassroots movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

Irene Zhao, a prominent Chinese model and influencer, has transitioned into a significant figure in the crypto space as the founder of So-Called, a Web3 social platform for creators, brands, and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Her journey provides [[insights_on_the_entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges_in_the_crypto_space | valuable insights into building and managing a business in the crypto industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Transition to the Crypto Industry

Irene's foray into crypto began in early 2021 as the CMO of a DeFi project, alongside university friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Leveraging her existing skills as an influencer, she was tasked with marketing and promoting the project on Twitter, which is indispensable for crypto-related content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

She quickly gained significant traction on Crypto Twitter, accumulating 100,000 followers within half a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. This rapid growth was attributed to the scarcity of women in the crypto space at the time and the support of her existing Instagram followers who were also crypto Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. She found that Twitter requires being "really smart in how you tweet" and constantly monitoring what's happening to understand jokes and memes, as the crypto audience is highly intelligent and less tolerant of "cringe" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

Her interest in NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) was sparked when a friend sent her a CryptoPunk for free in July 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. She quickly recognized the potential of NFTs as a "very good business for the creators" to tokenize various forms of content, such as videos, dances, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

## Founding So-Called (Social Collectibles)

Driven by the realization that her large audience could be leveraged to create a community, Irene conceived the idea of using NFTs as a "gated channel" for exclusive content and an inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. This led to the launch of the "irinda NFT collection," a free mint that went viral and minted out in 30 minutes, partly due to its humorous and somewhat corrupted aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. This "social experiment" gained significant attention, including from influential figures like Logan Paul, which further boosted its prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

The experience with irinda NFT highlighted the complexity for creators to launch their own NFT collections, requiring smart contract developers and navigating multiple platforms like OpenSea, Discord, and Snapshot for community verification and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. This observation led to the creation of So-Called, a platform designed to simplify the process for creators to launch their own NFT collections "at the click of a button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

So-Called aims to empower creators by allowing them to own their content and community, shifting ownership from centralized social media platforms back to the creators and their fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. This model fosters a unique relationship where fans, as owners, become evangelists for the creator's success, benefiting from their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_perspectives_in_the_crypto_industry | Challenges and Perspectives in the Crypto Industry]]

### Market Perception and Education
A significant challenge for So-Called, especially in a bear market, is the conservative stance of many creators and their fans towards NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. There's a prevailing "false perception about NFT that it is always scam" and a misunderstanding of its value beyond profile pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>. The education barrier is high, with some fan bases, like K-pop fans, being particularly against NFTs, often due to environmental concerns or the perceived lack of value in celebrity-backed NFT projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

### Business Model Adaptation: B2C to B2B
To navigate these [[challenges_and_strategies_in_launching_and_scaling_a_crypto_startup | challenges]], So-Called has adapted its strategy, working with both B2C (individual creators) and B2B (businesses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. Many large companies are still invested in the NFT business, believing it's the future and willing to allocate resources, making them easier partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.

Examples of B2B work include partnering with Amber Lounge to launch F1 party NFTs as lifelong memberships and working with the phone brand "Nothing" to air-drop NFTs to early community members for tangible rewards like physical gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

## Fundraising and Growth
The fundraising experience for So-Called varied significantly with market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. Initially, convincing investors for a SocialFi project was difficult as the concept was new and not yet popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. Securing Animoca Brands as the first investor, a reputable entity, was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

After the irinda NFT's success, fundraising became much easier, with the company often oversubscribed for its seed rounds, as people had witnessed the viral potential of creative NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>. However, events like the collapses of 3 Arrows Capital (3AC), Luna, and FTX made investors "so conscious and like so nervous" about putting money into crypto, marking the start of a "real crypto winter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Raising money with tokens in a bear market remains challenging, especially for dApps compared to infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.

### The Roller Coaster of Building in Crypto
Building in crypto is an "emotional roller coaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>. Key [[resilience_in_business_and_its_importance_in_the_crypto_market | resilience in business]] lessons include:
*   **Acceptance**: It's crucial to accept current realities, whether it's burning money in a bull market or the difficulty of raising funds in a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Conviction**: The crypto narrative constantly changes, making it hard to always catch what's popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Entrepreneurs should remain firm in their core thesis while being flexible in adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. A bear market is a good time to build without noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
*   **Cost Management**: Rapid expansion during the bull market led to a high burn rate of $200,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. After realizing parties and marketing weren't bringing enough traction, the company cut costs and refocused on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>.
*   **Ignoring the Noise**: It's vital to ignore external noise, especially from social media where people often exaggerate or lie about their successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. Comparing oneself to others who appear to be making immense gains can lead to feeling inadequate and making poor decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.

### The Impact of Launching a Token
Launching a token introduces a "second business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. The token price often becomes a key metric for the project's perceived success, regardless of underlying development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. Builders must manage expectations from investors who understand the bear market while continuously working on new initiatives to boost the token's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

### Personal Growth and Happiness
For Irene, building her own business meant shedding the pressure of being an influencer, where she worried about likes and brand sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. However, it introduced new challenges like managing investors, partners, and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.

A core belief is that "shortcut is actually the longest road to success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Consistent building, even through failures, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>. True happiness comes from continuous growth and seeing one's work inspire others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>, such as meeting people who were inspired to get into crypto or start their own businesses because of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.

Meme coins have garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency world, often sparking debates about their intrinsic value and long-term viability. However, a deeper perspective suggests that at their core, **all** currencies, including traditional ones like the US dollar and even gold, function as memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Money as Energy and Memes
The fundamental nature of money is defined as energy, specifically human conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:09">[03:20:09]</a>. Anyone can create money if they have the right kind of energy behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>. This energy largely comprises a group of people deeply believing in something and being able to put conviction and energy behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

> "Anything that's fundable, exchangeable and liquid is money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:36">[03:34:36]</a>

This broad definition highlights that even a meme coin that exists for only five minutes is still money if it's easily transferable and exchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:19">[03:44:19]</a>.

A meme, in this context, is something that everyone agrees on and understands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>. This applies to:
*   **Gold**: Its intrinsic value is a meme; people believe it has value, so it does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin**: Its fundamental meme is being a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>.
*   **USD**: Backed by the meme of the US government's power and its utility as a medium of exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

This perspective suggests that every coin and money system is underpinned by a fundamental meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. The value and growth of a currency depend on more and more people converting to and believing in that meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.

### The Role of Utility
Contrary to popular belief, utility in a cryptocurrency often *contributes* to the meme rather than being its sole driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. For example, while Solana has utility, many users buy it for its meme value, which the utility then reinforces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>. Successful projects create a "virtuous cycle" where the unifying meme fosters culture, community, utility, and usage, which in turn reinforces the meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>. Utility can be anything that makes people happy, even if not traditionally seen as "essential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.

## PvP vs. PPP in the Crypto Ecosystem
The crypto industry is often criticized for being an "insider game," similar to traditional finance, where participants aim to dump on later investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. This is described as a Player-Versus-Player (PVP) environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. In a PVP game like Counter-Strike, the goal is to kill the opponent first, leading to widespread distrust among users, investors, and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>. Everyone is on "trigger alert," ready to sell at the first sign of trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

However, successful projects like Bitcoin did not achieve their trillion-dollar market cap through this behavior. Instead, they built a massive network of people who supported, invested in, evangelized, and spread the word about the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. This contrasts sharply with PVP and leads to the concept of People-Plus-People (PPP).

PPP is likened to a garden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. Instead of fighting over limited resources, participants work together to grow the garden, taking what they need while also replenishing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. This creates a healthy ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.

*   **Finite vs. Infinite Games**: PVP is a finite game where someone has to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. PPP is an infinite game, like the potential of Bitcoin or Ethereum, where the goal is for everyone to win and be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Zero-Sum vs. Positive-Sum**: Fiat is fundamentally a PVP system because it's a fixed amount that people fight over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. Crypto, however, can be a PPP game where new money is created for collective benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. This is about fostering a positive-sum environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

To shift the industry towards a PPP mindset, it's crucial to be comfortable with failure and downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>. These "fires" in the market clear out bad actors and reveal the true, resilient communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>. The community must also stop accepting adversarial behaviors from influencers or projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## The "Zero Culture" for Resilience
A vital philosophy for navigating the crypto space is the "zero culture": zero expectations, zero promises, and zero ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. This is a counterculture to the "Moon only" culture prevalent in crypto, which sets unrealistic expectations and leads to broken resilience when those expectations are not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.

[[the_role_of_speculation_and_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | Speculation]] and taking profits are healthy aspects of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>, but trying to win at others' expense is detrimental.

The concept of "post-traumatic growth" suggests that significant failures can lead to profound personal and professional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. By accepting and learning from painful experiences, individuals and projects can gain resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:39">[01:38:39]</a>. This internal motivation, driven by a desire to avoid past failures, is healthier than external pursuits like money or status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>.

Meow's experience with Jupiter Exchange includes accidentally starting a [[exploring_meme_coins_and_their_market_dynamics | meme coin experiment]] that led to the "zero culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:09">[02:44:09]</a>. He actively participates in launching and maintaining meme coins to better understand how things work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>.

### Attention and Narratives
In the world of crypto, attention is the most powerful resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:50">[01:36:50]</a>. While it can change the world if used well, it can lead to disaster if used negligently or poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>.

[[meme_coins_and_social_media_influence | Meme coins and social media influence]] are intertwined; they thrive on narratives. A narrative is how one communicates, and it's intrinsically linked to strategy, which is about successfully aligning people and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:18">[02:27:18]</a>. Both narrative and strategy are two sides of the same coin; one cannot exist effectively without the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:35">[02:35:35]</a>.

Patience is also crucial, as things often take longer than expected, but can then happen all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>. This resilience through downturns is key to long-term success.

## The Future of Money
The vision for the future involves a "global unified market" (GUM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:40">[03:09:40]</a>. This means a world where every asset class is unified in a single, easily accessible interface. It aims to eliminate the fragmented, expensive, and messy centralized systems (like Swift) that currently handle transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:40">[03:10:40]</a>. The goal is to allow anyone to seamlessly transact between any asset, anywhere in the world, with the underlying decentralized back-end ensuring fairness and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:18">[03:19:18]</a>. This ultimate freedom of money creation and transaction is the power of [[decentralized_finance | decentralized finance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:32">[03:32:32]</a>.

This future envisions a world with infinite numbers of monies, not infinite money itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This allows for individual countries and even individuals to have the freedom and power to create their own currencies, fostering a capitalism of money creation where the best forms of money — those with the most energy and attention — ultimately win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:47">[03:42:47]</a>.

> "We are heading to a world of billions of chains and ions of monies." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:18">[03:46:18]</a>

The emergence of [[the_rise_and_influence_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | social tokens and celebrity-launched meme coins]] is seen as an early manifestation of this vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. While critics point to bad intentions, the underlying principle is the creation of new forms of money with accompanying energy and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:55">[03:49:55]</a>. The responsibility lies with the community to accept or reject certain behaviors, ensuring a healthier ecosystem for [[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | the role of memecoins in the crypto market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>.

## Conclusion: [[impact_of_memes_on_cryptocurrency_and_culture | The Impact and Evolution of Memes on the Internet]]

## Core Business Operations

Wintermute primarily focuses on three key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>:

*   **Spot Crypto Market Making:** This is the core of their business, establishing them as the largest spot crypto market maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. They cover between 250 and 350 tokens across 80 venues, holding approximately 15% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. Their target market share in this area is 20-25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   **Derivatives Trading and OTC:** They are expanding their derivatives business from Singapore, focusing on Over-the-Counter (OTC) and bilateral trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. Wintermute has over a thousand counterparties and offers API plug-ins for liquidity to robo-advisors and fintech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. Their OTC clients range from high-net-worth individuals to $50 billion hedge funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.

This investment arm, initially strategic, is becoming more financially driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **Venture Building:** The company also engages in venture building, incubating projects like bbop and wcat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

## Founding and Evolution

Yan Turpin's journey into [[investing_in_crypto_and_identifying_market_opportunities | trading]] began at age 12, managing his family's stock portfolio and earning a performance fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. He later pursued an economics track and gained experience at a trading firm in Holland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

### Lessons from Previous Ventures

Turpin founded several companies before Wintermute:
*   **First Venture (Trading Firm):** A micro hedge fund under a family office that achieved significant returns (162% in the first year) despite market challenges like the Greek crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The main issue was a lack of long-term alignment with investors, who were diversified across other groups and didn't want the firm to expand into new asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This taught Turpin the importance of choosing investors wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Second and Third Ventures (Venture Studio/Cross-border Deal Broking):** These businesses were profitable enough to pay bills but lacked the scalability for significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The venture studio model, while useful for exploration and learning, struggled with spinning off products into independent startups and finding dedicated CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Wintermute's Genesis
Wintermute was co-founded by Yan Turpin and Evgeny Gaevoy in late 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The initial idea was to build a robust, scalable trading firm, prioritizing strong internal culture and aligned long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Turpin, focusing on fundraising and business development, partnered with a strong technical co-founder, addressing the need for complementary skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. The firm spent two years building its infrastructure before actively [[insights_on_crypto_trading_and_market_strategies | trading]] in mid-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Philosophy and Culture

### Focus on Self, Not Competition
A key philosophy for Wintermute is to not over-focus on competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Over-focusing can be discouraging, as competitors might seem larger than they are, and often their offerings aren't truly comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. It can also be a waste of energy that could be better spent on internal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The approach is to concentrate on doing their best, using competition only as a general guide for new business areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

### Resilience and Adaptability
While resilience is often seen as a strength, excessive resilience can be a negative trait if it prevents discernment between good and bad feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Resilience is only beneficial when moving in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Yan Turpin emphasizes the need for a balance between being assertive about one's choices and being open to listening to others' feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Team and Culture
Wintermute maintains a lean team, with under 100 employees, while competitors may have 300-500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>. This helps maintain a consistent culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>. They prioritize in-office work to foster collaboration and shared mission, believing that physical presence and direct communication save time and prevent misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>.

### Strategic Scaling
To scale a business effectively, Turpin suggests the "10x" thinking framework: imagining how to multiply revenues tenfold with the current business model or identifying necessary transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>. This might involve re-evaluating the target market or pivoting the offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. Focusing on a niche that can be dominated is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

## [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto | Investing]] Philosophy

Yan Turpin views [[investing_in_crypto_and_identifying_market_opportunities | investing]] as a competitive intellectual endeavor, driven by the satisfaction of backing the right entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:45">[01:38:45]</a>. He appreciates the opportunity to meet and help smarter people and the social impact of creating jobs, especially for those who might otherwise be "unemployable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>. His investment approach in crypto is akin to startup [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto | investing]], suggesting treating it as long-term capital that can be lost without leverage, and waiting for significant (10x) returns over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:22">[02:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:08">[02:04:08]</a>.

## Market Outlook

Yan Turpin is hopeful that Bitcoin will surpass $100,000 within the next 12 months, driven by institutional interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>. He believes that the market's relatively small size and growing institutional involvement will contribute to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:31">[01:59:31]</a>. He cautions against using high leverage in crypto due to its volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:10">[02:01:10]</a>. He advises against "aping" into projects to make quick millions, instead recommending focusing on consistent profitability and building a track record to attract larger investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:41">[02:05:41]</a>.

## The Entrepreneur's Journey: Beyond Business Challenges

Jason Yanowitz, co-founder and CEO of Blockworks, has openly discussed the profound impact of [[personal_hardships_and_mental_health | personal hardships]] and [[mental_health_and_personal_development | mental health]] on his life, particularly as an entrepreneur. He shares his experiences with a debilitating condition and the broader challenges faced by founders in demanding industries like crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

## Cluster Headaches: A Personal Battle

Yanowitz disclosed that he suffers from cluster headaches, a condition he had been hesitant to share publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

> "They are known as suicide headaches. The rate of suicide in people with cluster attacks is between 9 to 11 times than the average population. It's not that people want to kill themselves or that they don't like their life, it's that they want to get rid of the pain in the moment." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>

*   **Symptoms and Severity**: Cluster headaches, also known as trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia or cluster attacks, cause intense pain in or around one eye on one side of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. They occur in "clusters" for about a month, with two or three attacks per day, and then recede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. On a pain scale, they are rated as a 10 out of 10, considered by neurologists as the "most painful physical feeling a human can endure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.
*   **Medical Treatment**: Yanowitz manages his condition with a range of treatments including nerve blocker injections to target the trigeminal nerve, calcium channel blockers (Verapamil), oxygen tank use, and Sumatriptan injections as a rescue medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. He also receives monthly injections to address neurological inflammation and hormone imbalances that occur during cluster periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
*   **Psilocybin as a Potential Treatment**: Research, particularly from institutions like Yale, Princeton, and Johns Hopkins, suggests that psilocybin is as effective, or even more effective, than some conventional treatments for cluster headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. The scientific rationale lies in the molecular similarity between psilocybin (a triptan) and common rescue medications like Sumatriptan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. Yanowitz experimented with psilocybin during his worst cluster period in summer 2023, though a terrifying attack while on it made him hesitate to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

## The Healthcare System's Challenges

Yanowitz highlights the significant difficulties in navigating the healthcare system, even with a strong support network and financial means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. He criticizes the bureaucracy and lack of resources for rare diseases like cluster headaches, as funding often prioritizes more common conditions like cancer and Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. His experience resonates with others who have faced a "vicious circle" of misdiagnosis, ineffective treatments, and lack of care within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

## The Founder's Pain: Stress and Mental Health

Yanowitz believes that the job of a founder involves "enduring pain 24/7," often manifesting as [[personal_growth_through_adversity | mental pain]] that exerts itself in physical forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.

*   **Physical Manifestations of Stress**: He notes that many founders experience physical ailments like rapid hair loss, extreme back pain, or conditions similar to his cluster headaches, which he attributes to stress and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. His co-founder, Mike, also suffered from debilitating back pain despite being in his 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.
*   **Balancing Ambition and Well-being**: The host shared his own [[personal_growth_and_recovery_experiences | personal experience]] with suicidal thoughts during a period of severe health issues, emphasizing that such feelings often stem from an intense desire to escape pain, not necessarily from depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[balancing_high_ambitions_with_mental_health | balancing high ambitions with mental health]].

## Burnout: More Than Just Overworking

Burnout, according to Yanowitz, rarely stems from simply working too much, but rather from "working on things that are not meaningful" and not doing things one enjoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. This realization guides how he and his co-founder manage their roles at Blockworks, ensuring they can continue to love and enjoy their work for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>.

## Overcoming Stigma and Vulnerability

Yanowitz initially hesitated to speak publicly about his cluster headaches due to concerns about appearing "weak" or "psychologically weak" to investors or the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. He recounted an instance during fundraising where he experienced a cluster headache mid-call, his face drooping and eye shutting, requiring an immediate injection from his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

However, he decided to share his story to encourage more founders to talk about their struggles, believing that [[personal_healing_and_selfawareness | vulnerability]] can be a "superpower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. Sharing creates deeper connections, as most people, even successful ones, have experienced some form of [[mental_health_challenges_in_highstakes_trading | mental]] or physical ailment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The volatile and 24/7 nature of the crypto industry, with its emotional swings, takes a significant toll on people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

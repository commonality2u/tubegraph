Building in public is a core philosophy for JP Thor, an engineer, investor, and founder of [[thorchain|Thorchain]], a decentralized exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This approach stands in stark contrast to traditional secretive development models, advocating for transparency and the free flow of information to accelerate progress and upgrade humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

### What is Building in Public?
To "build in public" means to set ideas and information free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. It implies that if one builds in secret, they are intentionally withholding useful information from humanity that should otherwise be freely accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. This philosophy rejects the traditional mechanisms of information protection like NDAs, copyrights, trademarks, and patents, believing they should all be "ripped apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.

Instead, good ideas are meant to flourish by being shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>. The focus is on execution rather than guarding the idea itself, as "ideas are cheap, execution is everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.

### The Benefits of Transparency
Building in public offers several significant advantages:
*   **Accelerated Idea Spread** Building in public significantly accelerates the rate at which an idea spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.
*   **Increased Investability** Founders who build in public become "far more investable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>. Investors seek founders who can demonstrate their ability to navigate adversity and solve problems, which is evident when mistakes are made and fixed transparently in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.
*   **Attracting Mind, Time, Effort, and Capital Share** A founder's goal is to attract and refocus mind share, time share, effort share, and capital share towards their vision to help a good idea flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.
*   **Building Trust and Brand** Sharing information openly, like Gary Vaynerchuk's strategy of teaching everything so people don't need him, paradoxically builds trust and brand, ultimately attracting more engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

### The Downside of Secrecy
The primary reason people protect information is to extract maximum value at the margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. However, if the sole purpose of building is to maximize financial gain, rather than contributing to humanity, it means one is not a "true founder" or "true builder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.

### Connection to Memetic Evolution
Thor views the purpose of humanity as upgrading itself both genetically (through having children) and "memetically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. Memes, in this context, are highly potent pieces of information with a long half-life that contribute to humanity's collective understanding and survival in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>. Building in public is a direct way to contribute to this memetic repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. By sharing knowledge and ideas freely, one is contributing to the advancement of human intelligence, similar to how scientific discoveries like F=ma or E=mcÂ² upgraded human understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.

### Practical Application
For founders, Thor advises:
*   Immediately pushing code to GitHub and open-sourcing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   Getting rid of business licenses, copyrights, trademarks, and NDAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.
*   Documenting the building process on platforms like Twitter and YouTube, even for "super secret" hardware startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.
*   Being transparent about mistakes and showing how they are navigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.

This approach demonstrates a founder's ability to solve problems and adapt, making them highly attractive to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

### Personal Experience
Thor initially built his first few projects publicly, realizing the difficulty of handing them over if tied to a public identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. For [[thorchain|Thorchain]], he initially built under an anonymous identity, 'Lena', to enable a planned obsolescence and allow the project to truly decentralize and be community-run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. Once the protocol was fully decentralized and beyond his unilateral control, he decided to reveal his identity and lean into personal branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. This allowed him to engage in a bigger way, bring attention, and inspire others to build, especially in the context of [[challenges_of_building_in_the_web3_space|Web3 challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. The limitation of anonymity was that 'Lena' couldn't attend conferences or do podcasts, relying on others to market the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>. By shedding the persona, he could now actively bring attention and mind share to [[building_a_decentralized_community_and_ecosystem|decentralized liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

This philosophy of being a creator, not a consumer, extends to every aspect of his life, viewing his assets (like a helicopter or a music festival arena) as "output devices" for creating and spreading memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>. He believes this is the path to true happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>.

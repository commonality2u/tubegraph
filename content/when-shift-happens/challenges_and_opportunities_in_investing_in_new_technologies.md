Investing in nascent markets and new technologies presents both unique [[Challenges and opportunities in the crypto ecosystem | challenges and opportunities]]. According to early crypto investor and founder Melum Demos, speculation plays a crucial role in driving growth in these emerging sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Melum Demos: Early Crypto Investor and Founder

Melum Demos is a General Partner at Crucible and was previously the Chief Strategic Officer at CoinShares, Europe's largest digital asset investment firm, which oversees $7 billion in crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. She considers crypto a great place to spend the last nine years of her life due to the many disciplines it touches, including philosophy, economics, and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Motivation and Philosophy

Demos describes herself as driven by knowledge, finding joy in understanding things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For her, investing is the exercise of translating knowledge into Alpha, and she enjoys the competitive aspect of a scorecard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. She aims to "catch things before they catch fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

Demos entered the Bitcoin space in 2015 after its price had cratered significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Her "aha moment" with Bitcoin was when she sent her first transaction, feeling like she was "doing something naughty" due to its ease and perceived craziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. She was exposed to the Bitcoin ecosystem through her brother and later, while at MIT, connected with prominent figures like Dan Elitzer, Jeremy Rubin, and Gavin Andresen, who was the maintainer of the Bitcoin core repo after Satoshi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

Her decision to "take the jump" into crypto was primarily driven by boredom with corporate finance and a desire to align her skills with something that made her "feel alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. She joined DCG (Digital Currency Group) in 2015, hired by Barry Silbert's prior firm, SecondMarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Her experience there, particularly during the blocksize wars and facing regulatory and cybersecurity [[Challenges and risks in the crypto industry | risks]], taught her about the power of communities and gave her immense respect for founders in the Bitcoin space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

## The Nature of Investing in Nascent Markets

### Beyond Intellectual Rightness: Narrative, Attention, and Capital

In the crypto era, success isn't solely about being "intellectually right" or having technically innovative products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. It's increasingly about a founder's ability to create compelling narratives, capture attention, and compete for capital, Total Value Locked (TVL), and transaction volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This means understanding "social dynamics" and how they transform markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Demos notes that Bitcoin itself functions more like a religion and social movement than just a technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Market Microstructure Shifts

The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has fundamentally shifted market microstructure, with new capital inflows primarily going into these ETFs rather than flowing into altcoins as in prior cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Demos cautions against the idea that institutions are coming to buy "shitcoins," emphasizing a "barbell" outcome where projects either go to zero or "catch fire" and achieve escape velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

### The Role of Speculation: Fueling Innovation

Demos asserts that "price drives price" and that speculation is the "fuel that makes the future possible" in nascent markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

#### Historical Parallels (Railroads, Internet)

Drawing on Carla Perez's work, Demos highlights a recurring pattern where new technologies are initially "over capitalized" through financial bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Railroads:** An initial boom led to many scams and failures, but ultimately transformed transportation and created new industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **The Internet:** The dot-com boom, characterized by intense speculation in companies like Pets.com, followed a similar pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.
*   **Enterprise SAS:** Also experienced similar high valuations and speculative investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

Crypto has undergone several waves of fervent speculation (ICOs, DeFi, L2s), with many protocols capitalized at ambitious valuations, but only a "small handful of winners" will make it through the speculative bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.

#### Critique of Anti-Speculation Stance

Demos criticizes individuals in crypto who have gained wealth and influence through speculation but then denounce it as "not a real use case" or "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. She views this as "intellectually dishonest," emphasizing that speculation is a foundational part of any nascent industry and a natural human way to "make bets on the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. She argues that projects like Helium have survived and matured precisely *because* of the speculative fervor that provided them with runway and capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.

#### Absurdity and Performance Art (Ether Rocks, Dick Butts)

Demos embraces the "absurdity" of certain crypto projects, citing Ether Rocks and Crypto Dick Butts as examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. Her first NFT purchase was an Ether Rock for $35,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. She sees these as "performance art" that highlight the absurd yet profound nature of crypto culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. She likens them to meme coins, which, despite their preposterous nature, are often more engaging than protocols with high valuations but little actual activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

She quotes William Blake: "The path to wisdom is paved with excess, because you never know what is enough until you've had too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. This philosophy suggests that the "excesses of crypto" highlighted by projects like Ether Rocks are emblematic of the culture and its journey.

## Understanding New Technologies: A Framework

Demos uses a framework to understand value creation in new technologies, starting with fundamental principles.

### Thermo-economics: Energy and Matter

All technology, including money, can be seen as an "abstraction of thermoeconomics," fundamentally anchored to energy and matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Bitcoin, for example, created "thermoeconomic money" by requiring energy and specialized semiconductors (ASICs) to operate, thus anchoring it to the laws of thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.

The current AI boom is also driven by "compute," which relies on access to energy and semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>.

### Three Levers for Value Creation

Demos identifies three core levers for building businesses and creating value in new technologies:
1.  **Technical Innovation:** This includes new sources of energy, generation models, distribution/transmission, and semiconductor innovations (e.g., photonics, biocomputing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>.
2.  **Operating Leverage:** Optimizing the way assets and infrastructure are operated through managed services, tooling for running nodes, or validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>.
3.  **Financial Engineering:** The design and utilization of financial primitives and derivatives markets, like the DeFi building blocks for capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:51">[01:34:51]</a>.

These three levers work together in a cyclical relationship, as seen in the oil industry with fracking (technical innovation), leading to new operating models and the facilitation of a robust futures market (financial engineering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:14">[01:35:14]</a>.

### Infrastructure: The Foundational Layer

Infrastructure, defined as the "scaffolding that people build things on," is foundational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:51">[01:37:51]</a>. It breaks down into two categories:
*   **Physical Infrastructure:** Tangible components like data centers, energy grids, and hardware.
*   **Digital Infrastructure:** Protocols, frameworks, and financial primitives (like ERC-721 for NFTs) that enable digital interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a>.

Demos stresses that new infrastructure unlocks new applications, creating a recurring cycle where infrastructure gets overcapitalized, leading to new applications, which then also get overcapitalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>.

#### Crypto's Impact on Physical Infrastructure

Contrary to being purely digital, crypto has had a "massive impact on the world of atoms," specifically on semiconductors and data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.
*   Bitcoin catalyzed a multi-billion-dollar boom in dedicated semiconductors and data centers due to its fixed block reward, forcing miners to optimize operating costs (Opex) through efficient operations and low-cost electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. These optimized Bitcoin data centers are now ideal for GPU deployments needed for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   Ethereum's proof-of-work mining drove massive demand for GPUs, contributing to Nvidia's success in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
*   Filecoin and other proof-of-space and time protocols in 2020-2021 led to a surge in demand for Solid State Drives (SSDs), benefiting companies like Seagate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

This demonstrates that crypto has shown "tremendous upside lift," making historically unattractive hardware and physical infrastructure categories compelling for investors again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

## The Future: AI, Crypto, and Human Adaptation

### The S-Curve of Adoption

Demos discusses the S-curve of adoption, where new technologies experience a slow build before an exponential uplift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. She believes crypto has not yet reached its parabolic moment of adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>, as the primary interface for most users is still a centralized exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

### AI Agents as a Catalyst for Crypto Adoption

Demos predicts that the "AI economy" and "AI agents" will unlock crypto's exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. Humans struggle with the complexities of public-private key cryptography and crypto's user experience hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. However, AI agents, operating on code, will have no problem interacting with crypto's underlying mechanisms, making it easier for them to operate within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>.

### Adapting to Change

Demos emphasizes that new technologies, like robots or social media, are often viewed through a "good or bad" lens by older generations, but ultimately, "the market decides what's good or bad" with price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. The most important thing is to adapt to what *is* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. She always felt confident that Bitcoin would "radically reshape Capital markets, financial system, global economies," viewing it as a question of "when," not "if" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. This conviction extends to her current work.

## Personal Philosophy for Navigating New Frontiers

### Self-Sovereignty and Lived Principles

Demos is building her new firm, Crucible Capital, independently, calling it her "third time on the roller coaster, but this time I'm doing it my way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. She stresses the importance of adhering to the principles one preaches, particularly self-sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. She practices this by working towards taking her house "off the grid" with a propane tank, generator, well water, and future solar and battery installations integrated with decentralized energy protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. She contrasts this with crypto enthusiasts who talk about self-sovereignty but have not taken concrete steps in their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.

### Work-Life Balance and Mental Health

Building anything is "incredibly hard," especially in crypto, requiring immense inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. The hardest part of raising money is not the fundraise itself, but the expectations that come with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>. Demos emphasizes managing psychology, prioritizing physical health, and finding ways to recharge, such as keeping her calendar empty for creative space and serendipity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

### Engaging Beyond the Echo Chamber

Demos finds it crucial to step away from the crypto echo chamber and engage with non-crypto people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. Having dinners with friends in commodities, FX trading, or clean tech helps her gain external perspectives, run ideas by them, and test her ability to explain complex crypto concepts to an outside audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. She actively uses platforms like LinkedIn for broader reach, noting its effectiveness due to the lower quality of content and lack of crypto-specific engagement there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. She also prefers giving framework-oriented talks to help ideas "click" for audiences and values direct feedback to refine her messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>.

The [[evolution_of_the_cryptocurrency_market_and_personal_investment_strategies | cryptocurrency]] and blockchain ecosystem has undergone significant transformation since its early days, particularly concerning its underlying infrastructure and adoption.

## Early Beginnings and Challenges

Eddie Travia, a blockchain pioneer and co-founder at Coinsilium Group, began his involvement in the space in 2013, facilitating financing for [[innovations_in_digital_payments_and_cryptocurrency | Bitcoin]] startups. Coinsilium Group, the first crypto company to be listed on a stock exchange, was founded in 2015 and has been investing in [[the_evolution_of_digital_wallets_and_blockchain | blockchain]] companies for nearly nine years, also engaging in advisory and venture building for Web3 projects [00:00:14], [00:03:33], [00:04:10], [00:04:29].

In its nascent stages, the crypto space faced significant educational hurdles. In 2015-2016, explaining basic concepts like Bitcoin and blockchain to brokers and market makers in London often took an hour [00:06:15]. Before the boom in 2017-2018, many mainstream companies were unfamiliar with these terms [00:06:54].

Bitcoin's initial purpose was as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system [00:33:42]. Its evolution into a "digital gold" or store of value happened organically as people began to rely on mathematics rather than politicians or central banks [00:33:46], [00:33:52].

### Bitcoin ETF and Maturation

The approval of the Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) was a long-awaited event. The Winklevoss brothers first applied for a Bitcoin ETF in 2013 [00:05:01]. Despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denying a Bitcoin ETF for ten years, during which Bitcoin's value increased by approximately 8,000%, its eventual approval signifies a major milestone [00:05:07], [00:05:17].

> "ETF marks an end in the beginning it could lead into a different form of Entrepreneurship" [00:01:11]

The delay in approval built significant pent-up demand and expectation, leading to unusual excitement in the financial world [00:07:19], [00:07:34]. The approval of 11 large companies, including Fidelity and BlackRock, managing trillions of dollars, to offer Bitcoin ETFs means Bitcoin is now recognized as a legitimate asset class capable of sustaining substantial market activity [00:09:03], [00:09:14].

This recognition marks a "maturity" of the crypto sector [00:10:05]. Leaders like Larry Fink of BlackRock, a major proponent, are now discussing tokenizing every asset on the blockchain and its potential to prevent financial fraud [00:10:26], [00:10:42]. This indicates a cycle where a new, unexpected asset class emerges from scientific corners like cryptography, becomes economically relevant, and, despite regulatory challenges, is eventually accepted and integrated into traditional financial systems [00:11:15], [00:12:49].

> "Bitcoin and cryptocurrency assets are actually going to help these Legacy institutions make money and reach an audience that maybe they wouldn't have reached and help retail investors certain certain retail investors who maybe initially or for years have been either indifferent or against Bitcoin or crypto and now they can they can actually own a piece of you know of this... disruptive asset ecosystem" [00:13:43]

Crypto is seen as a "savior" for financial institutions because it offers new products that resonate with a younger audience, helping banks remain relevant amidst declining traditional banking models [00:00:44], [00:14:34], [00:15:19]. It is perceived as the asset class of the new generation due to its potential returns, community vibe, and speculative nature [00:16:02], [00:16:11].

However, the integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial products like ETFs means that these large institutions now rely on the underlying Bitcoin infrastructure to function, becoming stakeholders in its development [00:29:10], [00:29:35]. Companies like Bitwise and VanEck have even pledged a portion of their fees to support the Bitcoin core network development [00:29:19], [00:29:27].

## Decentralization and New Opportunities

While Bitcoin and Ethereum have achieved institutional validation, creating new opportunities for investors, the focus for entrepreneurs shifts to less "mature" and "underrated" sectors of the crypto space that offer asymmetric returns [00:32:12], [00:32:50], [00:33:04].

### Web3 and Data Ownership

A significant opportunity lies in the ownership of data and the development of decentralized social media in Web3 [00:34:17], [00:35:53]. In Web2, platforms centrally control user data, lack portability and interoperability, and monetize user-generated content without fair compensation to the creators [00:34:41]. This makes influencers "hostages" of these platforms, vulnerable to arbitrary content removal or platform hacks [00:35:23], [00:35:46].

Web3 aims to address this by allowing users to own, port, share, and monetize their data and content [00:36:02], [00:36:11]. Identity also becomes a foundational element in this decentralized digital space [00:36:36].

*   **Bison Network** is a Web3 social network for creatives [00:00:24].
*   **Asar Network** is a decentralized blockchain platform partnering with Web2 conglomerates (like Sony) to onboard billions into Web3, enabling full ownership and effortless transfer of assets [00:01:44], [00:02:26].
*   **Lens Protocol** is a "social graph" for Web3 apps, facilitating data portability and serving as an underlying protocol for decentralized social media applications [01:02:00], [01:02:59], [01:03:34], [01:03:59]. It is built on Polygon, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution [01:16:17]. The team behind Lens Protocol also developed Aave, a large [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] platform [01:06:37].
*   **Ad Bazar**, developed by the Bison team, is a decentralized programmatic advertising network that uses public wallet information (like NFTs or gaming tokens) to serve relevant ads, allowing users to earn money directly from advertising [01:07:07], [00:38:47], [00:39:18].

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

[[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] is another area ripe for innovation [00:43:10]. Its "composability" feature, often referred to as "DeFi Legos," allows developers to pick and choose different tools, protocols, and existing platforms to build new applications [00:43:39], [00:44:02]. This enables applications to be built on top of each other, making them more powerful [00:45:10].

DeFi platforms, despite being function-specific programs driven by smart contracts, still rely on elements like branding and community to attract users [00:45:37], [00:46:31]. Examples of active and dynamic DeFi platforms include those on Solana, like Camino Finance, MarginFi, and Meteora, which prioritize intuitive user experiences [01:08:08], [01:10:06], [01:10:14].

*   **Solana**, despite facing an existential crisis a year prior, has emerged as a "darling" in the current cycle, offering fast and cheap transactions, making it easier for new users to adopt [01:08:45], [01:09:36], [01:10:41].
*   **Yellow Network** is a decentralized clearing network that aims to create a new infrastructure for crypto trading, faster and better than existing centralized exchanges (CEX), decentralized exchanges (DEX), or OTC trading [00:58:16], [00:59:33]. It functions as a mesh network of broker nodes, similar to Lightning Network, to facilitate quick, peer-to-peer transactions [01:00:01], [01:00:07]. This project seeks to redefine crypto trading, which has historically been the most lucrative activity in crypto [01:01:02].

## Infrastructure: Lessons from the Internet

The early internet in the 1990s was very open-source, similar to early crypto [00:48:12]. However, it gradually centralized with the rise of "huge monsters" like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, leaving little open-source infrastructure today [00:48:25], [00:48:35]. The internet's original vision was a decentralized network for scientists, but a layer of centralization, influenced by standards set by countries like the US, was built on top of it, creating centralized points such as domain names [00:49:40], [00:50:00], [00:50:51].

There is a concern that the same pattern could occur in crypto, where disruptive small entities become even larger monopolies, akin to Coinbase becoming the "Facebook of crypto" [00:48:43], [00:49:54].

### Call for Decentralization

There is a strong push to "decentralize everything" [01:01:17], [01:01:23], [01:01:44]. However, this does not mean replacing everything with smart contracts, as there is a risk of creating a "dystopian future" where human decision-making is eliminated [01:02:18], [01:02:44], [01:02:46], [01:02:48]. While smart contracts are excellent for deterministic processes like finance, which is a social construct, they are not suitable for areas closer to human nature, such as justice or law [01:03:00], [01:03:31]. The over-reliance on programming to control all aspects of life could be a mistake, as human input can still make a positive difference [01:04:15], [01:04:22].

> "There are instances where the human input actually can make a positive difference and definitely a positive difference and and we we we cannot remove it" [00:55:30]

From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

IET aims to build the world's largest [[the_role_of_crypto_in_ai_development | AI compute cloud]], distinguishing itself as a "better, cheaper, faster" cloud service rather than solely a [[decentralized_ai_and_democratization_through_crypto | decentralized company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The company's goal is to compete directly with major cloud providers like CoreWeave, AWS, and GCP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, viewing itself as already the largest [[decentralized_ai_and_democratization_through_crypto | decentralized AI Cloud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Problem: Compute Shortage

A significant [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development | challenge]] in AI development is the shortage of compute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Historically, most companies relied on compute from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. However, AI applications are "absolutely ravenous" in their consumption of processing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. The processing requirements for machine learning and deep learning applications are doubling every 3.4 months, equating to a 10x growth every 18 months and 100x growth every three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. This unprecedented demand cannot be met by large cloud providers, as they lack sufficient GPUs, and building new data centers is slow and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## IET's Decentralized Solution

IET operates as the "Airbnb of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, aggregating underutilized compute resources globally into a single platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. There are thousands of independent data centers in the US alone operating at 12-18% capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>, and millions of consumer devices (laptops, PCs, gaming rigs) with GPUs that are barely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

This [[advantages_and_challenges_of_deploying_decentralized_infrastructure | decentralized network]] approach offers several benefits for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>:
*   Access to virtually unlimited computing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>
*   Almost infinite scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>
*   Censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>
*   Improved performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>
*   Significantly lower costs, up to ten times cheaper than centralized networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>

## Why AI Needs Crypto

The speaker strongly believes that [[the_role_of_crypto_in_ai_development | AI needs crypto]] because it needs decentralized networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. The two main reasons are:
1.  **Solving Compute Shortage**: [[advantages_and_challenges_of_deploying_decentralized_infrastructure | Decentralized networks]] are the most effective way to address the global compute shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.
2.  **Scalability for AI Agents**: The [[future_of_ai_and_its_intersection_with_crypto | future of AI]] envisions [[the_implications_of_ai_agents_on_traditional_market_dynamics | trillions of AI devices]] and [[the_intersection_of_crypto_in_ai_agents | AI agents]] operating on billions of nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. This requires a permissionless infrastructure, which cannot be orchestrated effectively by a centralized entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. This future involves consumer devices, mobile devices, and even smart cars providing compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

## Challenges for Decentralized Networks

The biggest [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development | challenge]] for [[advantages_and_challenges_of_deploying_decentralized_infrastructure | decentralized networks]] is competing against the established dominance of major players like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. These incumbents offer comprehensive services including compute, storage, data, and networking on a single platform, which is extremely convenient for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. For decentralized networks to succeed, they must replicate this comprehensive offering but at a significantly lower cost, ideally one-tenth of the centralized alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

## Disruptive Innovation and The Innovator's Dilemma

The speaker argues that incumbent big tech firms cannot compete with a disruptor like a [[decentralized_ai_and_democratization_through_crypto | decentralized network]] due to the "innovator's dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. To compete with a decentralized offering, a centralized company would have to dismantle and rebuild its entire business model, which would destroy its existing structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. This makes [[the_evolution_and_future_of_crypto_and_ai_integration | crypto]] unique as a truly disruptive technology, unlike AI or VR companies which can be acquired by large firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. There is "literally no defense against decentralization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a> for centralized entities because they cannot recreate a decentralized network without destroying themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.

In this context, crypto is not an industry, but a tool â€“ a way to organize a network in a [[decentralized_ai_and_democratization_through_crypto | decentralized fashion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. Similarly, AI itself is not an industry, but a tool that will soon be integrated into every company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker firmly believes that [[advantages_and_challenges_of_deploying_decentralized_infrastructure | decentralized networks]] are not just the best solution for AI, but the *only* solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>. The ongoing and worsening compute shortage, combined with the vision of [[the_implications_of_ai_agents_on_traditional_market_dynamics | trillions of AI agents]] operating on billions of devices in a permissionless environment, makes a centralized entity incapable of facilitating this [[future_of_ai_and_its_intersection_with_crypto | future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.

The wine industry, particularly the luxury and [[investment_grade_wine_as_an_asset_class | investment grade wine]] sector, is experiencing significant [[cultural_perceptions_and_family_dynamics | cultural and generational shifts]] in consumption and investment patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. Historically, wine investment has been "captured by the Boomer generation" and older generations, largely due to access and traditional market structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.

## Investment Barriers for Younger Generations

Investing in [[investment_grade_wine_as_an_asset_class | investment grade wine]], a $250 billion asset class that has seen a 1,000% return in the last 20 years, remains incredibly difficult for new or younger investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. While one can invest $100,000 in stocks or bonds in minutes, or gold in ten minutes, the same investment in luxury wine might take over a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>. This is due to the market being "completely opaque" with "Gatekeepers everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. There is no real price transparency or price discovery, and entering the market often requires finding someone trustworthy to gain access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.

## Changing Consumer Expectations

Younger generations, often described as digitally native, have evolving expectations for products and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>.

### Preference for Experiences and Transparency
Unlike previous generations who may have focused on possessions, younger consumers "want experiences rather than products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. They prioritize unique and interesting memories over material goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. This shift is deeply rooted in their expectation of transparency, as they "abhor opacity" and are used to finding answers quickly on their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

### Desire for Connection
Modern consumers also seek strong connections with brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. In traditional wine, this connection is challenging because luxury wine makers cannot advertise on television, in print, or easily on social media, making it difficult to acquire customers or tell their story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.

## The Impact of Global Experiences

David Garrett, co-founder and CEO of Divin Labs, emphasizes the importance of global experiences in shaping worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Having grown up in a small town in Michigan without international travel until his mid-twenties, he later built businesses in six countries and visited over 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

He observed that living outside one's upbringing, especially for long periods, makes it hard to return to a narrow perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This exposure reveals that "life quality is not the same everywhere" and fosters independent opinions, contrasting with national pride that might claim a country is "the best place on Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. For example, he notes that Switzerland, while having a high quality of life, lacks a strong [[cultural_influence_on_entrepreneurship | risk-taking culture]] compared to the US, where people are less concerned about failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Ultimately, there is "no perfect place," and life is full of trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Garrett believes that the "best gift" parents can give their children is the ability to "experience other cultures" and "know the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. He encourages young people to explore and "get lost as early as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Challenges of the Traditional Wine Industry
The traditional wine industry, particularly the [[challenges_and_innovations_in_wine_distribution | distribution]] model, is characterized by its opacity and reliance on "Gatekeepers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.

### The Role of Middlemen
The *Plasa Bordeaux*, an affiliation of *negociants* (first-layer middlemen), has historically served as a marketplace connecting wineries with importers and distributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. While they have provided value by building customer bases and distribution networks, they often take "an outsized share" of the revenue and "relatively little risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. This includes buying and selling wine on credit, minimizing their financial exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. Critics argue that wine makers, who bear the significant risks of production over years, should receive more of the rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.

### Lack of Data and Feedback
The wine industry largely lacks [[the_role_of_data_in_wine_production_and_distribution | data]], especially on the consumption side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. Unlike digital products with instant consumer feedback, wine is often consumed ten years after purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. This disconnect makes it difficult for wine makers to get feedback for product development, optimize supply chains, or effectively acquire customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. Existing platforms like Vivino struggle because incentives are misaligned, rewarding extreme public reviews rather than constructive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.

## [[Blockchain_technology_in_the_wine_industry | Blockchain Technology in the Wine Industry]]

Divin Labs, founded by David Garrett, aims to solve these problems by building "the operating system for the wine industry" using [[blockchain_technology_in_the_wine_industry | blockchain technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.

### Tokenization and Digital Deeds
Divin decentralizes wine by placing "luxury and investment grade wine" on the [[blockchain_technology_in_the_wine_industry | blockchain]] to transform it from a possession into an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. They create a "digital deed of ownership," or "digital product passport," for each bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. This "digital cork" tracks chain of ownership, chain of custody, provenance, and provides anti-fraud and anti-counterfeit protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.

This process aims to:
*   **Increase Transparency:** Provide precise data on how many bottles of a given vintage remain on the market, enabling better pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.
*   **Boost Liquidity:** Introduce price transparency and discovery, bringing "a ton of liquidity into the marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.
*   **Improve Access:** Open the [[investment_grade_wine_as_an_asset_class | investment grade wine]] market to younger investors who are often priced out of traditional assets like real estate or stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.

### VIN Coin for Engagement and Data
Divin is launching "VIN coin," a native token on Solana, which functions like "air miles for wine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. Wine makers attach this token to bottles, and consumers can claim it when they open the bottle, providing consumption data back to the wine maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. This data includes where and when bottles are consumed, helping with product development, supply chain optimization, and customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.

In return, consumers receive VIN coin, which can be used to buy more wine, purchase experiences (like tastings or winery dinners), or be exchanged like other loyalty points with other luxury brands interested in connecting with high-end consumers (e.g., Four Seasons, Rolls-Royce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. Consumers can also trade VIN coin on exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>. This system directly connects wine makers and wine lovers, creating a loyalty program and valuable data feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.

## The Future of Adoption
Divin's approach to [[web3_and_the_tokenization_of_wine_industry | Web3]] in wine is focused on functional projects that abstract away the underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. Similar to how people use Spotify without needing to understand MP3s, the goal is for consumers to participate in [[blockchain_technology_in_the_wine_industry | blockchain]] and crypto without needing to know about wallets or NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>. This represents a significant "step change" towards wider, "civilian adoption" of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

The company is thinking in "generational terms," building tools that their children and future wine makers' children will use, prioritizing long-term goals over immediate adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>. This forward-looking perspective addresses the "biggest threats" to the wine industry: changing consumer expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

Terra, founded by Do Kwon, is a blockchain protocol focused on creating [[importance_of_stablecoins_in_cryptocurrency | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This article explores the nature of stablecoins, their utility, the different [[Different Types of Stablecoins | types of stablecoins]], and why algorithmic stablecoins like Terra's are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Do Kwon's Journey to Crypto and Terra

Before entering crypto, Do Kwon worked as an NLP engineer in Seattle, where a lack of exciting work led him to tinker with side projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. He developed software for a Wi-Fi mesh network, allowing devices to connect via Wi-Fi Direct or Bluetooth for free internet access, even without a direct connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This technology was then packaged into a B2B networking solution for large venues like amusement parks and shopping malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

His work on distributed mesh networks led him to discover Bitcoin and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He became increasingly involved in the crypto space, eventually making the jump to work full-time in crypto by founding Terra in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Defining Stablecoins and Their Usefulness

A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to retain a stable value against another asset, typically the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. While usually pegged to the US dollar, a stablecoin could theoretically be stable against the price of gold, a Big Mac, or other fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For current purposes, it means low price volatility against the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The usefulness of stablecoins stems from the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. While Bitcoin's fixed monetary policy is a feature for investment, its price volatility makes it unsuitable for financial applications or everyday transactions like paying for a cab ride or denominating a salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Volatility adds a transaction cost and creates uncertainty for both payers and recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Stablecoins fix this by allowing familiar financial transactions denominated in fiat currencies to occur within a crypto context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This enables complex financial applications to be built while retaining the permissionlessness and censorship resistance of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Why Stablecoins are the "Killer App" in Crypto

Despite skepticism that fiat-pegged currencies indicate a failure in crypto, stablecoins have become the most used asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. While Bitcoin may become more stable with wider adoption, it's unlikely to be stable enough to quote everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The ability to have flexible monetary policy, like fiat currencies, allows for price stability in the short term against consumer spending baskets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

As the overall crypto market has grown, stablecoins have proven to be the most useful product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. They are used as the base currency for centralized exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, and NFT sales, constituting the core liquidity for these markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Additionally, [[The Role of Stablecoins in Everyday Transactions | stablecoins are like "super useful dollars"]] that can earn yield (e.g., [[Highyield stablecoin interest | high yield stablecoin interest]]) and be transacted 24/7 globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## [[Different Types of Stablecoins | Main Types of Stablecoin Architectures]]

There are three main types of stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>:

1.  **Fiat-Backed Stablecoins**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Dominant types like USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) maintain a dollar's worth of assets in a bank account for every stablecoin issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. If the price falls, the issuer buys back stablecoins to maintain the peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   **Issues**:
        *   **Centralization Risk**: Users must trust the centralized custodian to hold the promised deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
        *   **Regulatory Risk**: Regulators can exert control over the issuer, potentially holding DeFi applications built on these stablecoins hostage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This defeats the purpose of decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
        *   **Scalability**: While initially trusted due to large backers, the risks scale poorly as market cap grows, increasing regulatory scrutiny and potential for systemic failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

2.  **Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoins**:
    *   **Mechanism**: MakerDAO's Dai is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. To issue $1 worth of stablecoin, a user locks up a greater value (e.g., $1.50) of volatile crypto assets like Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Liquidations and arbitrages ensure the peg if collateral value falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   **Issues**:
        *   **Limited Scalability**: Minting is driven by demand for leverage on the underlying crypto asset, not increased demand for the stablecoin itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This can cause the stablecoin to consistently trade above its peg if leverage demand isn't present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
        *   **Centralization Risk**: To address scalability, MakerDAO added USDC as a collateral type, leading to over 50% of Dai being backed by a centralized asset, compromising its decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

3.  **Algorithmic Stablecoins**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Do not use collateral but employ game-theoretic incentives to maintain their peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Terra's stablecoin (UST) is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
    *   **Terra's Stability Mechanism**: Users can always swap $1 worth of Luna for 1 UST, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
        *   If UST trades below peg (e.g., $0.90), users buy cheap UST and burn it for $1 worth of Luna, selling Luna for profit, which reduces UST supply and pushes its price up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
        *   If UST trades above peg (e.g., $1.10), users burn $1 worth of Luna to mint 1 UST, selling UST for profit, which increases UST supply and pushes its price down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
        *   This arbitrage continues until UST returns to its $1 peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

### The "Death Spiral" and Terra's Success

Many algorithmic stablecoins have failed due to a "death spiral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Projects like Iron Finance offered incredibly high APRs (e.g., 2000% daily) for depositing their stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. While this attracted capital initially, these "Ponzi economic recursive benefits" collapsed when capital left the ecosystem, leading the stablecoin's price to effectively go to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

The challenge is not the stability mechanism design, but building a "non-recursive robust economy" on top of these stablecoins that drives real usership and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Terra's success stems from its approach to money as a product, focusing on making UST the best product for saving and spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

*   **Spending**: Terra built payment services and e-wallets like Chai in Korea, integrated with major e-commerce merchants and offline venues (convenience stores, movie theaters, online grocery delivery, ride-hailing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This closes the retail loop, allowing users to buy almost anything with Terra stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Saving**: The Anchor Protocol allows users to deposit Terra stablecoins into a smart contract and earn a stable 20% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. This yield is powered by staking yields from various Proof-of-Stake blockchains (Solana, Ethereum, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
*   **Investing**: Mirror Protocol enables users to invest in synthetic assets representing real-world asset classes (e.g., Apple stock, ETFs) using UST as the gateway, allowing global access without leaving the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

This strategy created organic demand for UST through practical applications, rather than relying solely on high APRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. This creates "counter-cyclicality," meaning demand for UST should remain stable even during bear markets, as people still need to pay for everyday items or seek stable savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. During the May 2021 crash, UST's peg held extremely well, even with significant sell-offs, demonstrating its stability profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

## Community and Decentralization

Terra has fostered one of the most passionate communities in crypto, dubbed "Lunatics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. Do Kwon attributes this passion to a shared vision: a decentralized economy needs [[the_importance_of_decentralized_and_synthetic_dollars_in_cryptocurrency | decentralized money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. This vision resonates deeply as centralized stablecoins (like USDC or Tether) pose an "existential threat" to DeFi, allowing regulators to freeze assets or control protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Terra USD represents the best promise to decentralize the underlying monetary layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.

While Terraform Labs initially built marquee applications like Mirror and Anchor, the ecosystem is increasingly driven by hundreds of independent builders creating diverse projects, from NFTs and DExes to educational materials and new banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This organic growth and community participation are constantly reshaping Terra's narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

The goal is to reach a state where Terra USD does not need Terraform Labs, with the community self-organizing to develop updates, tooling, and new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. While the absence of Terraform Labs would slow growth, the community is robust enough for new leaders to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Strategy

Terra's strategy is not to compete directly with other Layer 1 blockchains like Solana or Avalanche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. Since a dollar of UST minted always burns a dollar's worth of Luna, it doesn't matter where UST is used (Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, or Terra itself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>. Terra aims for its success to be complementary and synergistic with other blockchain ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>, with the goal of UST becoming the standard decentralized stablecoin across all blockchain ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

**Market Cap & Dominance Projections**:
*   By the end of the year, UST is projected to reach or approach $10 billion in market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
*   By 2022, Terra UST aims to be the dominant decentralized stablecoin in crypto, likely surpassing Dai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
*   Ultimately, the goal is for UST to become the de facto decentralized money across the entire crypto ecosystem, constituting liquidity and medium of exchange for most use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.

## Columbus-5 Upgrade

The Columbus-5 upgrade brought three main changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>:

1.  **Scalability**: Increased the number of transactions processed by Terra blocks by 33x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
2.  **Interchain Connectivity**:
    *   Natively connected Terra to the Cosmos ecosystem via IBC (Osmosis, Cosmos Hub, Crypto.com chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.
    *   Integration with Axelar brings native [[Bitcoin as programmable collateral | Bitcoin as programmable collateral]] to Terra and better connections to Binance Smart Chain and Avalanche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
    *   Wormhole integration provides native connection to the Solana ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
3.  **Simplified Economics**: Luna burned to mint Terra USD now stays burned in perpetuity, making the economics clearer and easier to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This also helps simplify the staking rate for Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

Terra's total value locked (TVL) surpassed $10 billion, exceeding Solana's TVL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. Beyond TVL, important metrics include UST distribution by number of wallets and the amount of UST exported to other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>.

## Superior Applications and User Experience

Terra's applications, particularly Anchor Protocol, provide a sustainable, [[Highyield stablecoin interest | high-yield]] opportunity that has not been easily copied by other ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. While some components, like adding staking derivatives as collateral, are being adapted elsewhere (e.g., Compound Finance, Abracadabra's Magic Internet Money), the complete user experience and integrated ecosystem of Terra provide a distinct advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.

Terra's user experience is often described as superior and much easier compared to other ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>, leading to greater user stickiness. This is not necessarily due to Terra doing something "insanely crazy" but perhaps because other teams "set the bar low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

Future growth in usership is expected to come not just from DeFi, but significantly from metaverses and NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. These categories are more effective at bringing in everyday users, as they involve more relatable and exciting concepts than abstract financial yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. The focus is on unique assets that compose digital identities and property rights respected across various content platforms like games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. This shift is crucial for attracting a broader audience, including more women, into the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

The most exciting aspect of Terra's future is the unexpected growth of its community and the hundreds of apps being built, constantly reshaping Terra's narrative beyond the singular vision of its founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. This collaborative, open-source approach, where ideas are given away for the community to build upon, allows the entire ecosystem to grow exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.

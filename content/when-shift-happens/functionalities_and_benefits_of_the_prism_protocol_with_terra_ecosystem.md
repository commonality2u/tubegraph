[[introduction_to_prism_finance_and_its_impact_on_the_ecosystem | Prism Finance]] is presented as a novel protocol designed to revolutionize asset interaction within the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Its core aim is to "refract digital assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, addressing common issues like illiquidity of staked assets while enabling users to simultaneously earn yield and maintain asset liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Addressing Asset Illiquidity

Traditionally, staking assets like Luna with validators to receive airdrops or rewards locks them for a significant period, such as 21 days, rendering them "completely illiquid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This prevents users from utilizing their assets for other liquid activities, such as:
*   Generating bLuna for collateral to take loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   Providing liquidity for pairs like Luna/UST on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like TerraSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Prism Protocol introduces a solution that allows users to perform both staking and liquidity-providing activities simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## [[Understanding refracting digital assets in Prism Protocol | Refracting Digital Assets]]

At the heart of Prism's functionality is the ability to refract digital assets, much like a glass prism splits light into colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
When a user deposits a token, such as Luna, into the Prism vault, they receive a "collateral token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This collateral token can then be split into two fundamental components:

1.  **Yield Token (YT)**: Responsible for earning yield, staking rewards, and airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. For Luna, this is called yLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
2.  **Principal Token (PT)**: Responsible for maintaining asset liquidity, enabling use for borrowing, trading, and providing liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For Luna, this is called pLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

This mechanism allows users to isolate the specific risks they wish to speculate on or protect against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Users can choose a commitment term for their assets, ranging from one month to perpetually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The smart contract then mints pLuna and yLuna with a matching maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

It's also possible to combine equal amounts of PT and YT and burn them in exchange for a collateral token at any time, which can then be burned to redeem the original asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Benefits and Use Cases

Prism Protocol introduces new asset classes into DeFi, allowing for advanced risk management and capital efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Key benefits include:

*   **Instant Liquidity**: Raise liquidity instantaneously by selling future yield for a chosen period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Yield Guarantees and Price Protection**: Deposit assets to guarantee yield, protecting against price movements and liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Leveraged Exposure**: Gain leveraged exposure to an asset's yield or principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **No Liquidation Risk for Borrowing**: Borrow with "no liquidation risk or daily funding costs" by monetizing future yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Yield Swaps**: Swap variable rate yields into fixed rate yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Currency Risk Management**: Convert future yields into a stablecoin to manage currency risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Capital-Efficient Liquid Staking**: Receive "physical delivery of all staking rewards including airdrops" while being able to trade or deploy these assets instantly in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Automated Airdrop Claims**: Automatically claim all airdrops through Prism, reducing administrative burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Potential for arbitrage if demand for PT or YT creates price discrepancies that make their combined value greater than the original asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Example User Interaction

A user can deposit Luna into Prism, minting pLuna and yLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. They could then:
*   Stake yLuna in Prism to receive staking rewards and airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   Use pLuna as a liquidity provider in the pLuna Prism AMM pool, earning liquidity incentives and AMM fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   Later, decide to sell yLuna (without a 21-day unstaking period due to deep liquid markets) and use the proceeds to buy more pLuna, gaining leveraged exposure to Luna's price performance with no liquidation risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## The Prism Token and Future Roadmap

The native **Prism token** will be used for governance on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Staking the Prism token will earn staking rewards and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. [[Prism Protocol future roadmap and expansion plans | Future plans]] for Prism V2 include requiring validators to pledge Prism as collateral to be considered for Luna delegation from the Prism vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. A v-curve methodology will be used, giving more weight and voting power for longer staking periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

The token supply distribution allocates 30% to community and liquidity incentives, 15% to airdrops, 20% to the Prism ecosystem fund, and 35% to team, investors, advisors, and IDO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### Expansion and Interoperability

[[Prism Protocol future roadmap and expansion plans | The roadmap]] for Prism includes adding support for:
*   More proof-of-stake assets like Ethereum, Solana, Dot, and Atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Assets native to the [[Terra Ecosystem and the Future of Decentralized Finance | Terra ecosystem]] such as UST, Mirror assets, [[Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of Terra Network | Anchor Protocol]] (mine), and their respective LP tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   Assets created by new protocols at launch, including money market protocols, DEXs, and protocol bridging for USDC, DAI, and Tether to Terra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
The ultimate goal is to enable users to refract "every yield bearing asset" possible, including yield farms and LP tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Why the [[Terra Ecosystem and the Future of Decentralized Finance | Terra Ecosystem]]?

Prism Protocol chooses to build on [[Terra Ecosystem and the Future of Decentralized Finance | Terra]] due to its characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>:
*   A truly decentralized algorithmic stablecoin (UST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   Low fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   Fast transaction speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   Easy accessibility with cross-chain platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   The overall shift towards decentralized finance (DeFi) over centralized finance (CeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Building decentralized platforms on Terra "just makes sense at the moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, providing a much-needed and exciting innovation in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

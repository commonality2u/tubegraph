Open Ledger is a next-generation blockchain network focused on [[the_role_of_crypto_in_ai_development | AI]], providing decentralized economic infrastructure to source, fine-tune, and launch specialized AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Its core mission is to enable the creation of specialized AI models that help people solve specific, unique problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Transformative Impact of AI

AI is poised to have a far greater impact on daily life than previous technological revolutions, such as transport or the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While transport revolutionized the movement of goods and the internet connected people globally, AI is expected to "100x" all innovations achieved to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

AI's significance stems from its ability to enhance human thinking and processing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Unlike the internet, which primarily provided information, AI can also aid in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. This capability could potentially increase average human IQ by at least 10x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a> and bring educational resources to underserved regions like Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. AI acts as a powerful tool to boost productivity and expand opportunities, accelerating current revolutions across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

## The Need for Specialized AI Models

Current mainstream AI models, such as OpenAI's or LLaMA, are largely generic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. They are trained on vast amounts of internet data, which is suitable for general tasks like gaining context or drafting tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. However, for specialized tasks, such as a DeFi agent executing trades or on-chain activities, a generic model is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

The evolution of AI has shown a clear transition towards specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Early AI agents were often "ChatGPT wrappers" that provided generic answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Over time, AI developers began experimenting with and adopting multiple specialized models. For instance, an AI might use an OpenAI model to understand a math question and then route it to a specialized math model for a more accurate answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This highlights the importance of using the right tools to meet consumer needs efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Open Ledger's Solution: Tailoring AI Intelligence

Open Ledger addresses this need by allowing users to customize and tailor large language models for specific purposes, enabling the creation of specialized AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Ram Kamar, a core contributor at Open Ledger, likens generic AI to trying to cut a steak with a butter knife; for efficiency, a specialized tool is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. Open Ledger provides the tools necessary to build efficient models specialized for particular tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.

AI models are analogous to the "brain" of an [[the_intersection_of_crypto_and_ai_agents | AI agent]], directing its actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. For these agents to perform effectively and move beyond being "stupid" or "meme" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>, they require specialized intelligence and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## The Role of Crypto and Fairness in AI Development

Open Ledger leverages [[the_role_of_crypto_in_ai_development | crypto]] to bring fairness and democratization to AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. The core concept is that everyone should own a piece of this transformative technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

### Incentivizing Data Contribution
A significant challenge in AI is the need for vast amounts of data to make models smarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. While existing AI models are trained on readily available internet data, the "real knowledge" often resides with individuals and enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. Open Ledger aims to [[decentralized_ai_and_democratization_through_crypto | bootstrap data]] by enabling individuals to contribute their data and knowledge, ensuring they are continuously rewarded for its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. This contrasts with traditional AI companies that often scrape data without compensation or provide only one-time payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

This incentive model is likened to platforms like YouTube or Kao, where content creators are rewarded for their contributions, driving engagement and quality content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Open Ledger acts as an "orchestration platform" that brings data contributors and model builders together, ensuring participants in the supply chain are rewarded when their models are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

### Decentralization vs. Centralization
While centralized AI companies prioritize profit for their shareholders and internal teams, [[decentralized_ai_versus_traditional_cloud_providers | decentralized AI]] initiatives like Open Ledger focus on community benefit and collective contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. The goal is to build AI "together" to compete with centralized entities, ensuring intelligence is accessible to everyone and those who help bootstrap models are rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

It's acknowledged that decentralization is not universally needed but should be applied where it is most beneficial, such as fostering community involvement and ensuring fairness in resource contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>. Centralized and decentralized models can coexist, each having their advantages and disadvantages for different problem sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>.

## Practical Application: The Move Programming Language Model
An example of Open Ledger's impact is a specialized AI model built on its platform for the Move programming language, a relatively new language used by some Web3 protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. This Move-specific model, developed on Open Ledger, was benchmarked against a generic co-pilot model like Cursor and found to be significantly superior for Move-based requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

This specialized model enables the creation of better co-pilot agents that can assist programmers with Move language tasks, such as auditing code, programming more efficiently, or analyzing code flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. While a centralized entity *could* build such a model, the decentralized approach on Open Ledger facilitates crowdsourcing of data, which is crucial for building comprehensive and efficient specialized models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

## Conclusion: Fairness in the AI Revolution
The overarching takeaway from Open Ledger's approach is the necessity of fairness in the ongoing AI revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. Just as [[the_evolution_and_future_of_crypto_and_ai_integration | crypto]] introduced fairness to finance, it is poised to ensure that the intelligence and opportunities generated by AI are shared and rewarded among all who contribute to its development and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. Open Ledger embodies this principle by creating a platform that benefits those who build and utilize specialized AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

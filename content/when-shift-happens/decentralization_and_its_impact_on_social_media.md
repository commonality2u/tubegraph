Nishchal Shetty, founder of WazirX and Shardeum, discusses the necessity and potential of decentralized social media, highlighting the inherent problems with centralized platforms and the greater freedom offered by decentralized ecosystems.

## The Problem with Centralized Platforms

Shetty expresses a "personal beef" with centralized social networks, arguing that no single entity should wield such immense control over platforms that fundamentally enable free speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>. Centralized control has led to issues such as:
*   Misuse of user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>.
*   Shadowbanning or restricting reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>.
*   Unilateral changes to platform terms and APIs, forcing third-party products to adapt or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. Shetty experienced this firsthand when social media giants like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook began altering their platform terms, compelling his first company, Crowdfire, to pivot from a consumer-driven model to a business-driven one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. This power dynamic means that if an app builds on a centralized platform's API and starts generating significant revenue, the centralized entity might cut off access and build the feature themselves to capture that revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.

The challenge posed by centralized entities extends beyond social media platforms to app stores (Apple, Google Play), where changes in their policies or new product launches can cause hundreds of products to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

## The Promise of Decentralization

Shetty emphasizes that decentralized social networks are crucial because they rely on technology rather than the promises of individuals, groups, or company boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:47">[01:39:47]</a>. This technological reliance offers true protection for anonymity, privacy, and free speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>.

His personal mission aligns with this vision: to bring everyone into the decentralized ecosystem, similar to how he would have wanted to get everyone on the internet in 1995 due to the "magic" that happens with access to information and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. [[Decentralization and the Future of the Internet | Web3, as the next evolution of the internet]], fundamentally offers more freedom, including the [[Opportunities in Decentralized Social Media and Data Ownership | freedom of value ownership]] (read, write, own) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:13">[01:49:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>.

Furthermore, a decentralized ecosystem fosters an [[Decentralization and its challenges | inclusive culture]], where basic questions are welcomed, and the goal is to onboard everyone, rather than creating an exclusive environment that "makes fun" of those with less knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

A key challenge for decentralized social networks is avoiding the pitfall of simply replicating existing centralized platforms like Twitter or Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:22">[01:40:22]</a>. Just as online newspapers evolved beyond scanned PDFs of physical ones, decentralized social media needs new forms and ways of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a>.

Shetty believes that a new form factor will emerge, likely built by younger entrepreneurs, that will take off and become a massive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:05">[01:41:05]</a>. The future generations should not be confined to a few centralized social networks dictating global conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:30">[01:41:30]</a>. While the shift to decentralized ecosystems is inevitable, Shetty emphasizes the responsibility of current entrepreneurs to accelerate this transition to prevent future generations from experiencing the negative impacts of centralized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:47">[01:51:47]</a>.

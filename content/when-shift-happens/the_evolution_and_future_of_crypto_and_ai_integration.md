The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, particularly through the development of [[the_intersection_of_crypto_and_ai_agents | crypto AI agents]], is a rapidly evolving field with significant potential for innovation and wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Jensen Tang, co-founder and CEO of Virtuals Protocol, a leading [[the_intersection_of_crypto_in_ai_agents | crypto AI agents protocol]] on Base and Solana, shares insights into the journey of building in this space, navigating market volatility, and envisioning the future of [[future_of_ai_and_its_intersection_with_crypto | AI and crypto integration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Genesis and Growth of Virtuals Protocol

Virtuals Protocol embarked on its journey in early 2023 with an initial focus on [[decentralized_ai_and_democratization_through_crypto | decentralized AI infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. This narrative initially led to a significant market run-up, with the project's valuation increasing 20x by March and April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. However, a lack of fundamental contributions to the [[decentralized_ai_and_democratization_through_crypto | decentralized AI]] product led to a market correction, bringing the valuation down to 3x from its lowest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

Recognizing the need for stronger product-market fit (PMF), Virtuals pivoted towards the tokenization and co-ownership of [[the_intersection_of_crypto_in_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. This strategic shift, launched four months later, resulted in a "second run up," driving a 100x increase in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. This explosive growth, reaching a valuation of $2-4 billion, brought the project to the forefront of the crypto scene, attracting both attention and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

### Navigating Volatility and FUD

The journey of a [[the_future_of_the_crypto_market | crypto entrepreneurship]] is often described as a "roller coaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Virtuals experienced this firsthand, with its token initially dropping 99% from a $600 million market cap to $3-6 million before its significant rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. Despite the intense pain and uncertainty, the team persevered, driven by an obligation to their investors, especially retail holders who believed in their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

Jensen emphasizes the challenge of managing Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) in the public crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. His strategy involves limiting daily exposure to public social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram, reserving interaction for a specific time block later in the day when productivity naturally dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. This approach helps maintain focus and mitigate the mental toll of constant criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

The volatility in crypto is exceptionally high due to the significant speculative premium, unlike traditional Web2 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. This means that while a project might generate substantial revenue (e.g., $500,000 to $1 million a day at peak, dropping to $50,000-$200,000 during market shocks), its valuation can fluctuate wildly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.

### Strategic Expansion: From Base to Solana and Beyond

Virtuals' expansion to Solana, announced at the Jupiter conference, was a strategic move driven by several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. Solana offers significant liquidity, attracting many builders interested in launching their projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. Initially, Virtuals focused on one chain to establish itself, but having achieved a strong position on Base, it was time to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.

The future involves expanding to other chains, each offering a unique "edge" or specialization:
*   **Solana**: For its liquidity, attracting projects that need immediate attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.
*   **Saga**: Focusing on gaming, providing opportunities for [[the_role_of_crypto_in_ai_development | AI agent]] use cases in that sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>.
*   **Story Protocol**: Concentrating on intellectual property (IP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.
*   **Arbitrum**: Focusing on consumer applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>.
*   **BTC L2s**: Potentially offering more liquidity if Bitcoin's dominance continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.

This multi-chain strategy aims to grow the overall ecosystem by leveraging the unique advantages of each blockchain, with technological capacity being the primary limiting factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

## The Future: Sci-Fi Experiments in [[AI Integration in Crypto and Potential Impacts on Market Dynamics | Crypto and AI Integration]]

Jensen envisions ambitious, "sci-fi" experiments for the future of [[future_of_ai_and_its_intersection_with_crypto | crypto and AI integration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>. Virtuals possesses two key advantages: a vibrant ecosystem of builders eager to create autonomous agents, and a technological edge in autonomous commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a>.

The core idea is to establish a "Web3 agent" that can outperform a Web2 agent by controlling a permissionless wallet and accessing a permissionless economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. Banks are unlikely to grant agents direct control over funds for the foreseeable future, creating a unique opportunity for crypto-native agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>.

One major experiment is the creation of a "Zalu/Zu," a social-economic model where developers co-live and co-build businesses with autonomous agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>. These businesses could range from autonomous hedge funds to AI influencers like Luna running her own concerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:14">[01:30:14]</a>. The goal is to demonstrate that the economic output of such a micro-society, governed by AI-set policies, could rival that of small nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>.

Further **[[the_role_of_crypto_in_ai_development | AI integration in crypto]]** concepts include:
*   **Stablecoin Backed by Productive Intelligence**: A new type of over-collateralized stablecoin deriving its yield from the revenue generated by agents within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>. This stablecoin would facilitate agent-to-agent commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:57">[01:32:57]</a>.
*   **DeFi Infrastructure for Agents**: Developing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms specifically for agents to interface with, allowing them to collateralize tokens, take loans, and conduct autonomous businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>.

A controversial but potentially high-value use case is the "Internet Water Army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:11">[01:42:11]</a>. This involves autonomous agents producing human-like content, building follower accounts, and influencing narratives online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:37">[01:43:37]</a>. This could be used for marketing, PR disaster management, or even election campaigning, highlighting the power and potential ethical considerations of advanced [[the_intersection_of_crypto_in_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:14">[01:44:14]</a>.

## [[Building Wealth with Crypto and AI | Building Wealth with Crypto AI Agents]]: High-Value vs. Commodity Agents

For individuals looking to get rich with [[the_intersection_of_crypto_in_ai_agents | crypto AI agents]] without relying purely on luck, Jensen emphasizes understanding the distinction between a "high value agent" and a "commodity agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>.

A **commodity agent** offers easily replicable functions with no inherent "moat" or value accrual mechanism. Examples include an agent that orders food from DoorDash or a generic Twitter content poster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. These agents don't target a strong total addressable market (TAM) or solve a unique problem statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>.

A **high-value agent**, in contrast, possesses a unique "edge" through:
*   **Model**: Training on proprietary data or using advanced Federated learning models to understand user preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>.
*   **Data**: Access to exclusive or specialized information.
*   **Action Space**: The unique capabilities or integrations the agent can perform.

### Examples of High-Value Agents:
1.  **XBT**: This agent went viral because it solved a real problem: "What token do I buy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. Its edge was an information creation pipeline built over months, allowing it to provide valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:33">[01:37:33]</a>.
2.  **Sports Commentary Agent**: An agent trained on proprietary basketball analytics and coaching strategies can act as a sounding board for retail users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>. By building rapport and offering informed predictions, it can then act as a distribution platform, converting attention into monetary flows by suggesting bets on sports betting platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>. This model has a large target market and an unreplicable edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>.

While some might dismiss [[the_intersection_of_crypto_in_ai_agents | AI agents]] as mere "ChatGPT wrappers," Jensen argues they are "productive wrappers" that build perception, task planning, and reasoning layers on top of large language models, creating significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>. The key is to **bet on specialized capabilities, not commoditized functions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a>.

For more insights on high-value accrual agents, Virtuals Protocol has published a thesis under its Y Combinator platform, Agent Starter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>. This highlights the ongoing [[insights_on_crypto_and_technological_advances | technological advances]] at the intersection of crypto and AI.

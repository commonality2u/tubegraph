Tushar Jain, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, a thesis-driven investment firm focusing on cryptocurrencies, tokens, and [[crypto_and_blockchains_role_in_global_finance | blockchain firms]], believes that the next trillion-dollar businesses will be built using blockchain rails. He states that the individuals who build and invest in these businesses will accumulate the most wealth over the coming decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prediction is rooted in historical precedent, as significant wealth creation has consistently accompanied the emergence of new coordination mechanisms throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

## Multicoin Capital's Vision

Multicoin Capital was launched in 2017 by Tushar Jain and his friend Kyle, driven by a fascination with [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | crypto]] and a perceived gap in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. They recognized a lack of established frameworks for understanding and valuing cryptocurrencies and [[role_and_future_of_tokens_in_cryptocurrency_projects | tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. Their core thesis is that [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | crypto]] will generate the largest one-time shift in wealth in the history of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. This conviction stems from the belief that blockchain serves as a "credible coordination mechanism" similar to past innovations like the printing press and the internet, which revolutionized human coordination and led to immense wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

Jain sees [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | blockchain]] as the "new coordination layer for distrusting people to work together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. His professional mission is to increase access to the financial system, promoting self-custody of digital assets. He views self-custody as a "Trojan Horse" to instill a psychology of self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on centralized decision-making bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Key Investment Focus: Solana

Multicoin Capital notably placed significant bets on Solana in 2018 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Jain explains their strong conviction in the Solana ecosystem by highlighting three key user-centric benefits:
*   **Cheap:** Transaction costs are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Fast:** It offers the fastest block time and settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
*   **Easy:** It simplifies the user experience with "one wallet, one chain," avoiding the complexity of multiple bridged versions of assets found on other networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

Solana, as the first blockchain to offer this "cheap, fast, and easy" combination, has established significant inertia, making it challenging for newer competitors that aren't *significantly* better to unseat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.

## Investing in Blockchain: Ugly Truths and Strategy

When discussing the realities of [[building_wealth_in_crypto | crypto investing]], Jain points out several "ugly truths" that are essential to understand:

*   **Limited Current Use Cases:** There are currently only a handful of actual, compelling use cases for [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | crypto]], primarily revolving around payments, trading, and capital formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. Other areas, despite excitement, are "just not working" based on current data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **Focus on Winners:** Investors must focus on projects with a clear thesis and visible product-market fit, rather than "pie in the sky" ideas or "vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
*   **Patience and Conviction:** The hardest part of [[building_wealth_in_crypto | investing]] is not buying or selling, but waiting for a thesis to play out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. Both deep conviction and patience are necessary for delivering exceptional returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. This requires honestly analyzing mistakes, such as being impatient during early development phases of projects like Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   **Avoiding FOMO:** It's not necessary to be invested in "everything that makes money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. The focus should be on understanding an investment deeply; if it's not understood, it's not worth owning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **Knowing When to Exit:** The "waiting game" ends when the core thesis is invalidated, which requires brutal honesty with oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.

## Founder Traits for Success

Multicoin Capital looks for specific traits in founders within the blockchain space:
*   **High Agency:** Defined as someone who will "find a way" to accomplish a goal, even in challenging circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. This can be identified by past behaviors, such as college dropouts who prioritize their best interests over social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Honesty:** Founders must acknowledge the tradeoffs and downsides of their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. An inability to articulate potential costs or reasons for failure suggests a lack of honest self-assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.

## Managing Volatility in [[building_wealth_with_crypto_and_ai | Crypto]] Investments

The [[building_wealth_in_crypto | crypto]] market is notoriously volatile. Jain shares strategies for coping with immense paper gains and losses:
*   **Experience as a Guide:** Having navigated previous market crashes (e.g., 2018, 2020) provides a framework for understanding that "things are never as good as they seem and they're never as bad as they seem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.
*   **Avoid Emotional Decisions:** A key lesson from past mistakes is "don't make big changes to your portfolio during periods of extreme volatility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.
*   **Discipline and Detachment:** Jain used a personal rule of doing 10 push-ups or squats if he checked prices without the intention to trade, as a way to train himself against compulsive checking and the dopamine hit associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. He emphasizes not wanting to be a "forced buyer" or "forced seller" and trading on one's own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>.

The mission of Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, is to build a global onchain economy that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom, upgrading existing economic systems that are often decades or centuries old and failing people due to being too expensive, slow, frustrating, or discriminatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This new system aims to provide everyone, regardless of background or location, equal access to apps and tools for business and wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## The Purpose and Potential of Tokens

Tokens and onchain governance structures are considered "incredibly powerful tools" for organizing human beings and their collective work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. These new systems, built in software onchain, can achieve the same goals as traditional legal frameworks but "a thousand times more efficiently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>. This efficiency is expected to lead to "massive efficiency gains" that will ultimately "way outperform traditional organizations" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. The emergence of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and tokens is a direct result of this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.

Tokens can also facilitate innovative new models, such as the Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) legal framework in Wyoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. This framework allows for fully onchain governance with an entity that can provide cash dividends through staking, while still being governed by an overall mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms of Tokens

Despite their potential, one of the "most perverse and negative things that's happened on chain the last five years" is the prioritization of the token over the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. Projects sometimes launch a token even without achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. This approach is likened to an early-stage startup going public and facing public shareholders and price scrutiny before establishing its core product, which can be "incredibly toxic and negative for actually making great products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.

The success of projects like Base, Poly Market, and Farcaster, which do not have a token yet, serves as a "proof" that ignoring the "token noise" and focusing solely on building "the best freaking product" leads to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. The pursuit of "free money" from tokens is misleading, as it comes at the cost of distraction and dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

The industry has become "too caught up" in tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. The current "distortion around tokens" is attributed to people's fixation on money and a lack of regulatory clarity, particularly in the United States, which pushes projects into "weird shapes and edges" that prioritize regulatory compliance over achieving desired governance outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.

## The Future of Tokens and the Industry

The future of the crypto market is expected to become more rational and principled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. There will be a convergence where regulatory clarity improves, the "noise" and toxicity of premature token launches become evident, and a group of "principled Founders" who prioritize building "great freaking products" over years will be rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. Once these foundational products are established, then the industry can focus on how they can leverage new technologies, including tokens and governance, to achieve "great things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. This signals a shift from optimizing for financial incentives to prioritizing product development and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

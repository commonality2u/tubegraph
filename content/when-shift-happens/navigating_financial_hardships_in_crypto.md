Casper Johansson, co-founder of The Spartan Group, a prominent Web3 venture investor, shares insights on [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | navigating financial hardships and risks in the crypto market]], drawing from his extensive career in finance and entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. His journey highlights the importance of resilience, strategic decision-making, and a balanced perspective on [[the_challenges_and_rewards_of_crypto_investing | the challenges and rewards of crypto investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Starting Spartan Group: A Calculated Risk
At 43, with a wife and three children, Johansson made the significant decision to co-found Spartan Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The firm began as Angel Investors in crypto, identifying use cases like remittance and cross-border banking disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This move was perceived by some as "crazy," as both he and his wife transitioned from their careers, with their income dropping to zero initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:27">[02:02:27]</a>. They went "all in," investing most of their savings into the Spartan liquid token hedge fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a>.

Johansson's conviction stemmed from years of experience in banking and tech startups, recognizing the potential of Web3 as a new paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:05">[02:03:05]</a>. They felt early enough in 2017 to establish themselves before larger players entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:32">[02:04:32]</a>.

## Lessons from Past Failures and Setbacks

Johansson's career has been defined by "transition," marked by significant professional changes and personal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. These experiences provided invaluable lessons in [[navigating_losses_and_finding_success_in_cryptocurrencies | navigating losses and finding success in cryptocurrencies]].

### First Startup Failure (Big Data Company)
After leaving Goldman Sachs, Johansson launched a Big Data company that ran for three and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Despite working 100-hour weeks, the company failed to find product-market fit and needed more capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. The decision to shut it down was difficult, especially as they were first-time founders and had accepted "Angel money" from friends and family, making the loss more personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. He experienced "a huge amount of guilt" over the time sacrificed with his young child for something that ultimately yielded zero financial return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

### Chapter 11 Experience in Traditional Finance
Johansson also experienced a difficult period when a parent company he worked for went through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:28">[02:10:28]</a>. This process was highly political, with "knives literally coming out" as people fought for their financial interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. He felt disappointed by people he relied on, realizing that in such situations, one often has to look out for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>.

### The FTX Collapse
The collapse of FTX was a significant disappointment for Johansson, particularly due to the fraud involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:34">[02:12:34]</a>. He had personal funds on FTX, and the immediate thought was that the money was "lost," not just stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:57">[02:12:57]</a>. This experience led to feelings of foolishness and reinforced the crypto mantra: "not your keys, not your money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:16">[02:13:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:22">[02:13:22]</a>. He acknowledges the complexity of Chapter 11 law, especially in crypto where asset values can change so drastically, making the legal process feel unfair to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:59">[02:15:59]</a>.

## Strategies for Navigating Crypto Downturns

### De-risking at the Peak
In late 2017, as the crypto market became "super frothy" with "scammy projects" and a "frenzy," Johansson made the decision to sell "pretty much everything" at the peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. This decision, driven by discomfort with the running risk and feeling the market was "too much," allowed them to exit with substantial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. This capital then formed a sizable contribution to their first fund in mid-2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.

### Slow and Deliberate Deployment
During the 2018-2019 bear market, their fund deployed capital very slowly, with only 30% invested by early 2019, keeping 70% in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. This cautious approach proved to be good timing for ramping up investments in Q2 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.

### Cost Discipline and Resilience
To survive tough periods, particularly the 2018-2019 bear market, Spartan Group maintained extremely low costs, both personally and within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

> "Our lifestyle and like our kids have seen it right we've our our rent where we live how we travel when we travel how much we travel do we eat organic apples or regular ones like that varies a lot depending especially the early years of the company based on how we're doing right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>

This financial discipline prevented them from being forced to lay off staff due to financial pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

### Avoiding Leverage
A crucial lesson learned from a personal experience in 2000, where he put his entire student loan into a NASDAQ ETF which then crashed 80% in a week, was to never trade with leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:13">[02:29:13]</a>. Neither his personal crypto investments nor Spartan Group's funds use leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:11">[02:30:11]</a>. While this means potentially leaving money on the table in bull markets, it provides the ability to "write it out" during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:16">[02:30:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:32">[02:30:32]</a>.

## Understanding Market Cycles and Volatility

Johansson acknowledges that crypto has "booms and busts" similar to traditional financial markets, but they are often more extreme due to inherent volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The psychological impact of seeing paper wealth "evaporate" in crypto is much tougher than in traditional markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:37">[01:58:37]</a>.

### The Problem of Complacency
In crypto, it's "so easy to fall into complacency" when everything is going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. This leads to losing the sense of urgency and intensity, risking a loss of access to the best founders and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.

> "If you stopped the training because you just kind of broke the world record or did really well you can't expect to show up at the next race and do what you did before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>

### Beyond Financial Goals
While initial motivation for building businesses may be financial, successful individuals often reach a point where they realize it's not just about the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. The target of financial freedom often "keeps moving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. The true source of happiness is often "struggling and improving and feeling progress every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.

### Identifying the End of a Bull Run
Key indicators for the end of a bull run include "too much credit in the system" and "too much leverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:30">[02:33:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:32">[02:33:32]</a>. The derivatives market's open interest and an overheated "fear greed index" can signal unsustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:49">[02:32:49]</a>. It's difficult to time exits perfectly, and one must be prepared to "miss out in the last 30%" to avoid getting "caught out" by euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:06">[02:00:06]</a>.

## Advice for [[strategies_for_achieving_financial_freedom_in_the_crypto_space | Achieving Financial Freedom]] and Success

### Embrace Transition and Take Calculated Risks
Johansson emphasizes that [[understanding_and_embracing_change_in_the_crypto_market | embracing transition]] and taking risks is crucial for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>. He encourages people to "jump into new waters" even if it feels "unsettling and scary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.

> "People who have been put in transition earlier on in their life become better at it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>

This builds tolerance to stress, making future stressful situations feel less daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Learn from Failures and Keep Trying
Johansson advises that if a "first transition doesn't work," one should not give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. It's important to be thoughtful but "keep trying" if you have the drive to take risks and shake things up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

> "You need to make sure that you in terms of mental health and financially have enough kind of stay alive so to speak to keep trying till you figure what what works for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>

Success is not inevitable, but persistent effort increases the likelihood of finding what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

### Prioritize Happiness and Fulfillment
His life's mission is "to be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Happiness, for him, means looking back and not wanting to change anything, feeling fulfilled in work, personal life, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. For those feeling unhappy, he recommends identifying the problem with brutal honesty and taking risks to change the situation, guided by gut feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.

> "Trust your gut, don't be afraid to take risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:35">[02:25:35]</a>

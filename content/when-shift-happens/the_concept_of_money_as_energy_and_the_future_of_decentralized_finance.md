From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

The understanding of money is evolving, particularly within the cryptocurrency space, leading to a redefinition of its fundamental nature. This new perspective posits money as energy, driven by collective human conviction, which in turn shapes the [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | future of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>.

## Money as Energy and Memes

The purest form of money is considered to be the "meme coin," a concept that extends to all forms of currency, including gold, Bitcoin, and USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. A "meme" in this context is defined as something that everyone agrees on and understands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

Money is fundamentally energy, primarily human energy and conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. For money to function, a critical mass of humans must believe in it, bet on it, use it, and rally behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. This perspective unifies various forms of money, from traditional currencies like gold and USD to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and alternative tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. What differentiates money that lasts from that which doesn't is the sustained belief and energy of a community over a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.

Any asset that is liquid, fungible, and exchangeable can be considered money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. This broad definition challenges conventional financial literacy, which is often based on a singular money system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. The future envisions a world with an "infinite number of money" systems, each with the freedom to be created and integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. This "capitalism of money creation" drives competition for better forms of money, benefiting the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and its Potential

The power of [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | Decentralized Finance (DeFi)]] lies in freedom: freedom of money creation, freedom of transaction, freedom of ideas, and freedom of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are all considered forms of DeFi, as they represent financial systems not created by a centralized government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:48">[01:32:48]</a>.

A core vision for the [[future_of_the_crypto_market | future of the crypto market]] and beyond is the "Global Unified Market" (GUM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. This market would unify every possible asset class in the world into a single, easily accessible user experience or API, allowing seamless transactions between disparate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a>. Currently, traditional markets are fragmented and centralized, leading to complex and expensive intermediary systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:47">[01:34:47]</a>. [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] has the ability to democratize access to assets and integrate them into daily life, with decentralized systems operating transparently in the backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>.

## Shifting Paradigms in the Crypto Industry

The crypto industry has been criticized for being an "insider's game," similar to [[transition_from_traditional_finance_to_decentralized_finance | traditional finance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. A common mindset has been "player versus player" (PVP), where participants aim to profit by dumping on later entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. This environment fosters distrust within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

To foster growth, the industry needs to shift towards a "people, people, people" (PPP) mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

### PVP vs. PPP

*   **PVP (Player vs. Player)**: Characterized by a distrustful community where individuals are constantly anticipating others dumping their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>. It's a "finite game" where the goal is to not be the last one to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.
*   **PPP (People, People, People)**: Envisions an environment where all participants strive to create a collective win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>. It's an "infinite game" with no limits to potential, as communities work together for mutual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. This is akin to cultivating a garden where everyone contributes to growth and takes what they need while replenishing the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

This shift requires:
*   **Comfort with Failure and Downturns**: Market downturns, or "fires," clear away bad actors and weeds, allowing stronger, more resilient projects to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. These downturns help identify genuine PPP communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>.
*   **Rejecting Bad Behaviors**: The industry must stop accepting behaviors like influencers dumping tokens or poisonous characters joining simply for temporary pumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

### The "Zero Culture"

A key philosophy for navigating the volatile crypto space is the "zero culture": zero expectations, zero promises, and zero ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. This counter-culture directly opposes the "moon-only culture" that sets unrealistic expectations, leading to disappointment and broken resilience when unmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Embracing zero expectations helps individuals make more rational decisions, such as taking profits when prices are high and investing during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

### Resilience and Patience

Resilience is crucial in business, and it is often built through suffering and pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. Just as physical training builds muscles through struggle, facing challenges like public failure or financial setbacks provides invaluable self-awareness and determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This "post-traumatic growth" allows individuals and projects to learn from mistakes and become stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Similarly, patience is vital, as progress often seems slow before accelerating rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. Many projects fail because they give up too soon, missing the eventual acceleration of their market or development cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. The success of projects like Pendle demonstrates how conviction and persistence through tough times can lead to significant breakthroughs when the market eventually catches up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.

### The Role of Attention and Strategy

Attention is a powerful force that can be used to drive positive change or cause widespread harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. Leaders in the crypto space must learn to rally attention without making unrealistic promises of "the moon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>.

Strategy and narrative are two sides of the same coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. Strategy involves understanding the market realities, capabilities, and developing a plan to achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. Narrative is how this strategy is communicated to gain support and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:25">[01:27:25]</a>. Both are essential for success; strategy without narrative is Sisyphean labor, and narrative without strategy is delusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>.

## Don't Be "Mid"

In a world increasingly shaped by AI, where "mid" (mediocre) work is easily automated, humans must strive to be unique and extreme in their expression, whether for good or ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. The goal is to find one's authentic balance rather than conforming to societal pressures to "fit in" or "rebel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:26">[01:48:26]</a>. This self-discovery and the creation of one's own space and community contribute to personal fulfillment and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:05">[01:50:05]</a>.

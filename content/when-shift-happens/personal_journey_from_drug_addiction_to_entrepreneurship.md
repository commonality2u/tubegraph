Kane, co-founder and CEO of Infinex, shares his deeply personal journey from decades of drug addiction to building successful businesses in the crypto space, highlighting the profound impact of sobriety on his life and entrepreneurial approach.

## A Decades-Long Battle with Addiction

For decades, Kane engaged in significant drug use, starting at the age of 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. He describes his drug use as a way of "numbing" himself from emotions and not having coping mechanisms to deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. He would switch between various drugs, creating a chaotic pattern of consumption, which he now recognizes as "pure insanity" in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.

Despite this profound addiction, Kane managed to build businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. He recounts how he maintained a "tense equilibrium" between his work addiction and drug addiction, believing he was "fine" as long as he was functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>. He rationalized the intense drug use, even 36-hour benders, by thinking the consequences were "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.

## The Path to Recovery

The turning point came when his family became increasingly frustrated and he realized he wasn't present, even when physically at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. He describes attending rehab where he had to confront the reality of how drugs were impacting his brain and organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. After five weeks in rehab, he had a crucial epiphany: "Maybe I can't do drugs anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>, challenging a deeply embedded assumption about himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.

The initial six months of recovery were "fragile" and "painful" as his brain reconfigured itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. During this period, he prioritized traveling with his family, especially his wife, because he didn't trust himself to travel alone and risk relapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This commitment led to the family deciding all future travel would be together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Rebirth with Infinex

Significantly, the concept for Infinex, his new venture, began six months into his recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a>. He now attributes a newfound "understanding and empathy for other people" to his sobriety, something he lacked during his time with Synthetix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:39">[01:25:39]</a>. He experiences a physical sensation—a "buzzing in my forehead"—when he says something out of line or is about to enter a tense situation, which serves as a crucial self-awareness tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>.

Kane's motivation as an entrepreneur is deeply rooted in proving people wrong and fueling himself with skepticism, an [[addictive_personalities_and_discipline_in_entrepreneurial_success | "addictive personality" trait]] he now channels constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. While at Synthetix, he felt his "fuel barrel" of motivation had emptied, but with Infinex, it's "full again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a>.

## Finding Happiness and Purpose

Kane's relationship with money has changed; he reached a point with Synthetix where he didn't need to work for financial reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. However, he realized he needs to work to keep his brain occupied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>. His definition of happiness has evolved; he is "satisfied when I'm occupied" and has "a hard thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>. He emphasizes the need for entrepreneurs to feel productive and work towards a goal, as losing drive can mark "the beginning of the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>.

He highlights the importance of being present, especially with his children, and now feels a deeper connection to the world around him, experiencing both positive and negative emotions more fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>. This contrasts sharply with his past, when he was "disconnected completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:59">[01:28:59]</a>.

Irene Xiao, an influential woman in the crypto industry, shares her experience on how [[influence_and_monetization_through_social_media | social media influence]] impacts the [[exploring_meme_coins_and_their_market_dynamics | meme coin]] space and cryptocurrency trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_memes_on_cryptocurrency_and_culture | Impact of Memes on Cryptocurrency and Culture]]

Irene went into the [[exploring_meme_coins_and_their_market_dynamics | memecoin]] rabbit hole while trying to find "Alpha" on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. She noted that the earliest "Alpha" (valuable, often private, information) originates in Telegram and WeChat group chats, rather than directly on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

### Notable [[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | Meme Coins]] and Their Triggers

*   **Troll (TROL)**: This [[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coin]] gained traction after Elon Musk changed his Twitter profile to "Chief Troll Officer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. Some traders bought the token immediately and reportedly made millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Irene, despite being "a bit late," still saw a 500% (5x) return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   **Smiley**: Another [[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coin]] concept tied to Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>, which gave Irene a 1000% (10x) return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.
*   **Dog with Hat**: This [[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coin]] is widely discussed on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>, with some believing its concept (adding a hat everywhere) gives it better potential than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

### The [[influence_of_social_media_platforms_on_the_crypto_space | Influence of Social Media]] and Elon Musk

Elon Musk is seen as a significant figure who "feeds a lot of people in the crypto" space because tokens associated with him tend to generate substantial profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. Irene specifically focuses on these Elon Musk-associated coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.

A key strategy for [[understanding_meme_coins_and_their_place_in_the_financial_ecosystem | meme coins]] is knowing when to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. Irene sold 50% of her Smiley holdings when people started talking about it on Twitter, indicating it was "time to sell" because otherwise, "everything's going back to zero again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. When a [[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coin]] gains widespread public discussion, it's often too late to jump in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

## Trading Realities vs. Social Media Portrayals

On the internet, people frequently share how much money they have made in crypto, but rarely mention their losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This selective sharing of "unrealized gains" creates a perception that anyone can make significant money in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This can lead individuals to enter the market, thinking they can also succeed given their years of market observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Illusion of Leverage Trading

Many people start in crypto through trading, believing they can quickly make money, especially through leverage trading, which allows investing with borrowed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. However, this is described as an "illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

An estimated 90% to 99% of people do not make money trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Successful leverage traders are often those who have been liquidated multiple times, leading them to adjust strategies and develop a "gut feeling" for the market rather than relying solely on indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### Importance of Risk Management

Key to preserving capital in trading is implementing a stop-loss strategy and setting a maximum loss amount before entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Stop-loss orders can be "very dangerous" because sudden price drops might trigger them, but the price could recover quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. If sufficient margin is maintained, one might avoid significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

People often prefer to "buy spot" (hold the underlying asset directly) rather than engage in complex trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Trading on leverage can be mentally taxing, described as "mind-screwing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. It is a 24/7 market that can consume mental health and make one constantly worried about positions, even during personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

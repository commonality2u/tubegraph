Remi Tetot is a key figure behind [[Global macroeconomic views and societal reset predictions | Global Macro Investors]] (GMI), renowned for his insightful charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. He is also a co-founder of [[Establishing Real Vision and Macro Investing Strategies | Real Vision]] and currently leads the research analysis department at GMI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Early Life and Non-Traditional Path
Born in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, Tetot did not follow a traditional academic path, finding both English university and business school "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Instead, he embraced traveling and diverse experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. In his youth, he was passionate about basketball, even playing semi-pro for a period, and spent significant time playing video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

His early career was varied:
*   At 20, he moved to Spain to learn Spanish, working in bars and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   Around age 30, he started building websites and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   He also organized and managed parties in nightclubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> and owned a photography studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Entry into Finance and Co-founding [[Establishing Real Vision and Macro Investing Strategies | Real Vision]]
Tetot transitioned into finance about ten years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. His entry point was meeting Raul Pal, founder of GMI, while living in the same village in Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Impressed by Pal's macroeconomic research, Tetot pointed out that GMI's website and image did not reflect its top-tier status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This led to Pal hiring Tetot to revamp GMI's online presence, including creating the first iPad app for readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

A year later, while managing a restaurant in Paris, Pal offered him a job as an analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Despite having no formal finance degree, Pal valued Tetot's computer skills and offered to train him on the financial side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Pal has been Tetot's mentor for the past decade, teaching him "everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Tetot's background in technology proved crucial for the creation of [[Establishing Real Vision and Macro Investing Strategies | Real Vision]]. After Pal conceived the idea for [[Establishing Real Vision and Macro Investing Strategies | Real Vision]] with Grant Williams, Tetot was sent to Cayman to build the platform, hire staff, and establish the company's initial operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The core reason for [[Establishing Real Vision and Macro Investing Strategies | Real Vision]] was Pal's desire to democratize access to expert financial insights, especially after the 2007-2008 financial crash, where many ordinary people lost money due to lack of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The platform aims to provide high-quality, actionable financial information that is not typically available on mainstream media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Roles at GMI and [[Establishing Real Vision and Macro Investing Strategies | Real Vision]]
While still a significant shareholder, Tetot has not been involved in the day-to-day operations of [[Establishing Real Vision and Macro Investing Strategies | Real Vision]] for the past three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. At GMI, he manages all research, building systems, and creating charts for Raul Pal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. He also occasionally writes articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. His work involves maintaining a comprehensive database of global financial data, broken down by countries, segments, sectors, and asset classes, allowing for rapid chart updates and quick insights into specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. His primary focus is to help GMI stay "on top of the next move" in the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. He describes his relationship with Raul Pal as "he's the brain, I'm the master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: The Exponential Age
GMI's core investment thesis, developed by Raul Pal, is the "Exponential Age" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This framework suggests that the world is experiencing a compounding effect of technological evolution from the past two to three decades, leading to exponential growth in various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

This era is characterized by:
*   **Structural Innovations:** Such as the exponential growth in space technology (e.g., SpaceX contracts leading to faster internet access in remote areas, creating network effects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, and the rapid deployment of 5G networks (with 6G already in development) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Zero-Cost Computing Power:** The price of computing power has essentially fallen to zero over the last 20 years, enabling previously impossible or too expensive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Edge Computing and Moore's Law:** The rise of distributed computing power (like blockchain) is pushing Moore's Law to new heights, enabling more powerful devices and applications like AR glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Application-Layer Growth:** This structural growth enables exponential advancements in connected devices (80 billion expected by 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, data consumption (200x increase in 10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, and artificial intelligence (exponential increase in AI patents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Transformative Technologies:** Electric vehicles, autonomous driving, 3D printing (enabling rapid prototyping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, and virtual/augmented reality (forecasted for massive sales growth) are all part of this exponential trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Advancements:** The cost reduction in genetics mapping and the development of new vaccine technologies (enabled by edge computing, fast networks, and AI) are set to revolutionize healthcare and human lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

### The [[The significance of macroeconomic trends in the crypto space | Crypto Space]] in the Exponential Age
A core part of this framework is the network effect around [[The significance of macroeconomic trends in the crypto space | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. GMI research found that [[Investing in crypto and identifying market opportunities | crypto]] adoption tracks the internet's adoption in the 1990s, but at an accelerated pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Based on this, they project one billion [[Investing in crypto and identifying market opportunities | crypto]] users by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. This acceleration is attributed to the prior development of internet and mobile technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

Tetot emphasizes that the human brain struggles to process exponential curves, making data visualization crucial for understanding these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. He believes that the combination of current and new technologies will lead to unimaginable advancements in the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

### [[Managing risk and making informed investment decisions | Investment Implications]]
Given these trends, Tetot believes that neglecting investments in sectors built on network effects makes little sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. The massive money printing by central banks since the COVID-19 pandemic has debased currencies, leading to asset price inflation and wage deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. This phenomenon disproportionately benefits those with asset exposure, widening the wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. For younger generations (Millennials, Gen Z), investing in these volatile, exponential assets is seen as the primary opportunity to counter this debasement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

## [[Evolution of the cryptocurrency market and personal investment strategies | Crypto Journey and Allocation]]
Tetot first encountered [[Evolution of the cryptocurrency market and personal investment strategies | crypto]] in March 2013, when Bitcoin was at $53 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. He opened an account with Mt. Gox, which was later hacked, leading him to give up on it temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. GMI first wrote about Bitcoin in September 2013 and issued its first trade recommendation for clients at $212 less than a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. In 2014, GMI even presented on the "digitalization of everything," which foreshadowed NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

His deep dive into [[Investing in crypto and identifying market opportunities | crypto]] truly began during "DeFi Summer" in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. After reading a piece by Delphi Digital's CEO for GMI, he realized the transformative potential beyond just Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. He initially bought a significant amount of Ethereum at $230 in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. While he initially lost money due to undisciplined trading and learning curve mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>, it solidified his conviction.

Recognizing the scalability issues and high gas fees on Ethereum, Tetot began exploring other chains, concluding that the future of [[Investing in crypto and identifying market opportunities | crypto]] is multi-chain, with each chain playing a different role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. He notes that newer chains like Solana have reached significant market caps much faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum, reflecting an accelerating market and increased search for the "next opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.

His current portfolio reflects a high-conviction approach:
*   **100% Crypto:** Tetot has transitioned his entire net worth into [[Investing in crypto and identifying market opportunities | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>, making this decision about two months prior to the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.
*   **Zero Bitcoin:** He currently holds no Bitcoin, believing the risk-reward is not as compelling as other assets right now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>. He acknowledges he might re-allocate to Bitcoin for purchasing power preservation after the current bull run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.
*   **95% Terra (Luna):** His primary holding is Terra (Luna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. He was initially hesitant about Terra due to the "lunatics" community but was drawn in by Raul Pal's insights on new chains outperforming and the ecosystem's robust development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. He highlights Terra's closed-loop ecosystem (generating yield, spending via debit cards), making it highly accessible for mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.
*   **5% Polkadot (DOT):** He holds a smaller position in DOT, drawn by its multi-chain potential and upcoming parachain auctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.

Tetot believes [[Investing in crypto and identifying market opportunities | crypto]] is more than just an asset class; it is evolving into a new system that the world will function on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. He does not foresee an invalidation of the exponential growth trend in [[The significance of macroeconomic trends in the crypto space | crypto]] because it is a technological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. While there will be corrections, the long-term outlook for investors is a "no-brainer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Personal Interests
Tetot admits to an extreme work-life balance, being "24/7 connected" due to the constant stimulation of the [[The significance of macroeconomic trends in the crypto space | crypto]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. He feels "spoiled" by the opportunities in the [[Evolution of the cryptocurrency market and personal investment strategies | crypto]] space and believes "the real opportunity is now" to be fully invested both financially and in terms of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

His personal passion lies in the **metaverse and play-to-earn gaming** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. He is considering building a project in this area, potentially a play-to-earn game utilizing NFTs and AR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. He sees a massive economic opportunity in play-to-earn, particularly for emerging markets, where individuals can earn more playing games than in traditional jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[01:35:41]</a>. While centralized tech giants like Facebook will play a role, Tetot believes the metaverse will be a "multiverse" where decentralized applications will thrive, creating a new economy and business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:50">[01:38:50]</a>.

Beyond [[Investing in crypto and identifying market opportunities | crypto]], Tetot is most excited about improvements in genetics and healthcare over the next 5-10 years, particularly in extending human lifespan and improving quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>.

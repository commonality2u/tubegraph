From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

Jesse Pollak is the creator of [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]], Coinbase's Ethereum Layer 2 network, which aims to provide a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly platform for building decentralized applications onchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The overarching mission of Base is to build a global onchain economy that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This initiative seeks to upgrade economic systems that are decades or even centuries old by creating a new, more efficient, and accessible framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Jesse Pollak's Background and Motivation

Pollak's upbringing significantly influenced his vision for [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]]. Raised in Washington D.C., he attended a Quaker school where values like simplicity, peace, integrity, community, equality, and stewardship were emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. These values fostered a belief in making the world better through collective effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. His mother, a midwife, and his father, a labor lawyer, instilled in him the idea that he could accomplish anything and encouraged him to pursue endeavors that would change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Pollak identifies as having traits related to perfectionism, control, and intense focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. He can "lock in" for extended periods on a task he's interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. While he had a blessed childhood, his competitive soccer background, where he was consistently a "B-plus" player despite working extremely hard, instilled a "chip on his shoulder" that drives him to work relentlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This experience of working hard and not being the best taught him that continuous effort is the only path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

He initially discovered [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | crypto]] in 2012 while in college, learning about [[History and Impact of Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] from Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase's first employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This led him to buy [[History and Impact of Bitcoin | Bitcoin]] and later to build a security software company that primarily served [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | crypto]] businesses like Bitfinex and BitMEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. His deep fascination with [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | crypto]] ultimately led him to join Coinbase as an engineer in 2017, fully committing his career to the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

## The Problem BASE Aims to Solve

Pollak articulates the problems with existing economic systems and traditional app stores:
*   **Walled Gardens for Developers**: Developers building on platforms like iPhone or Android face a 30% revenue share taken by corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
*   **Exploitation of Creators**: Creators earn less than 1% of the total revenue generated by centralized platforms, enriching corporations at their expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
*   **Unequal Access for Users**: Access to apps and financial products is dependent on factors like birthplace, residence, or device, leading to massive disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Inefficient and Costly Traditional Finance**: Legacy systems are slow, expensive, frustrating, and discriminatory, failing the people they are supposed to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Remittance fees, for example, can be as high as $45 per transaction for low-wage workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

## BASE as the Solution

[[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] is designed as a new global app store and economic system built onchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. It aims to:
*   **Empower Developers**: Provide an open platform where they can retain their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   **Reward Creators**: Allow creators to put their content onchain and directly earn from their creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Ensure Universal Access**: Give everyone, regardless of background or location, equal access to the same apps and financial tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. This includes global, free payment rails that are instant and bypass traditional fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.
*   **Increase Innovation, Creativity, and Freedom**: By providing an open platform, [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] supports entrepreneurs, helps creators earn, and levels the playing field for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## The Journey to BASE (Aha Moment)

The journey to [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] involved significant iteration and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. Pollak initially pitched four different ideas before settling on [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]], including turning Coinbase into a DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. Other ideas involved an app marketplace, an onchain identity system (which later re-emerged as [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] Names), and an onchain content network for app distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

The "aha moment" for [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] came from repeatedly encountering the same problems when trying to build product ideas: scaling to 100 million users and seamless integration with Coinbase's product suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. It became clear that a dedicated platform was necessary to enable these products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. What started as an internal testnet ("BASENET," formerly "Coinet") to ease onchain building for Coinbase developers evolved into a platform for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. This iterative process, which Pollak likens to "feeling the different parts of the elephant," gradually revealed the comprehensive vision of a global onchain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.

## Coinbase's Role and the Centralization Paradox

Coinbase, a NASDAQ-listed and regulated company, incubating a decentralized Layer 2 like [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] presents an inherent tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. Pollak acknowledges this "paradoxical" situation, where a predominantly centralized, custodial, and offchain business is launching a decentralized L2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.

However, he views this as both the "greatest strength and greatest risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>:
*   **Strength**: Coinbase serves as an "incredible first customer." Solving problems for a 4,000-person public company provides a powerful playbook for other Fortune 500 companies to move onchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Leveraging Coinbase's distribution, efficiency, and resources allows for aggressive growth and proliferation of this new way of building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
*   **Risk**: The danger lies in becoming too centralized and losing sight of the goal of building an open, global onchain economy, which *must* be decentralized to ensure neutrality and universal participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

Crucially, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is committed to decentralization. Upon the [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] testnet launch, Armstrong emphasized the need to decentralize, stating that without it, "all of this will be for not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]]'s commitment to being an Ethereum L2 and building on the OP Stack (ensuring open-source contributions) further underscores this decentralized path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. Their actions, such as launching fault proofs on testnet and making progress on a security council, aim to demonstrate their commitment to decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

## Criticisms and Focus for the BASE Ecosystem

Pollak's primary criticisms and desired focus areas for the [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] ecosystem are:
1.  **Build Products People Want**: [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | Crypto]] often gets lost in economic incentives, tokens, and game theory, losing sight of the fundamental need to build valuable products that users desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
2.  **Make it Easy to Use**: For a new global onchain economy to succeed, it must be "better than every online product that exists today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. The combination of smart wallets, [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] Names, and L2s provides the infrastructure for powerful consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.
3.  **Onboard New People (Missionary Work)**: The community has a "moral responsibility" to actively bring new people onchain, explain the benefits of this new economy, and help them understand how it upgrades broken systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. This direct engagement also provides crucial feedback for improving products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.

## Growth and Philosophy

Despite [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]]'s rapid growth and leading position among Layer 2s, Pollak maintains a humble perspective. He emphasizes that it is still "day one," and the current scale is less than 0.1% of what is needed to bring the world onchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. He is not interested in competing with other L2s but rather with traditional online experiences, striving to make onchain 10x or 100x better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>.

The core philosophy of [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] is to avoid "crazy incentive games" or "pumping token price" and instead focus on building great products that solve real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. This focus on product development, combined with cultural memes like "build and you will be rewarded" and "stay based" (working hard, being optimistic, pushing boundaries), fosters an ecosystem centered on putting in "an ungodly amount of hard work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.

## The Role of Tokens and Governance

Pollak believes that tokens and onchain governance structures are "incredibly powerful tools" that represent a new, more efficient way of organizing human beings and collaborative work, outperforming traditional legal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. However, he criticizes the "perverse and negative" trend of prioritizing tokens over product development, often launching tokens before achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. He compares this to a startup going public just months after launch without a proven product, leading to a "toxic" and "negative" environment for product creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>.

The success of projects like PolyMarket and Base, which have grown significantly without a token, serves as evidence that focusing on building the best product is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. This approach requires years of "focus and rigor and relentlessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. Pollak acknowledges that regulatory clarity (especially in the US) and the emergence of new legal frameworks like Wyoming's DUNA (Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association) will help mature the industry and allow for more principled approaches to tokenization and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.

## Communicating Value Proposition

Pollak stresses the importance of clearly communicating [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | crypto]]'s value proposition to the "real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

### How Crypto is Good for Humanity
[[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | Crypto]] offers an opportunity to build a "next generation of the internet" that upgrades inefficient, expensive, and slow legacy systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. It provides:
*   **Best-in-class Financial Services**: Accessible to everyday people regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
*   **Fairer Platforms for Creators**: Allowing them to own and profit from their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.
*   **Tools for Entrepreneurs**: Enabling them to build businesses 10x cheaper, faster, and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>.

This shift from online to onchain is akin to the internet's transformation from offline to online in the early 2000s, promising massive increases in innovation, creativity, and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.

### How Everyday People Benefit
Pollak provides tangible examples of how everyday people can benefit from [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | crypto]]:
*   **Art and Creativity**: Platforms like Zora or Rodeo allow direct support for creators through micro-payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.
*   **Dining Experiences**: Apps like Blackbird enable better dining experiences, lower fees for restaurants, and optional [[Sui Network and Blockchain Innovation | crypto]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Global Payments**: [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | Crypto]] facilitates instant, free global payment rails, eliminating high remittance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.
*   **Small Business Empowerment**: Businesses can accept USDC for free, potentially doubling their profit margins by eliminating credit card fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>.

To get started, one can create a Coinbase Wallet in less than 5 seconds using biometrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.

## Cultivating Optimism in Crypto

In an industry prone to extreme emotional swings tied to price volatility, Pollak advises cultivating optimism by:
*   **Avoiding Trading Focus**: Trading is a "PVP game" that is often not economically positive and is detrimental to mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Control**: Identify what is within your sphere of influence and put your head down to make daily progress, no matter how small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. This habit of progress builds optimism by demonstrating tangible change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
*   **Embracing the Builder Mindset**: People who contribute and build for the right reasons are welcomed with open arms in the [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | crypto]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Adopting Stoicism**: Internalizing Brian Armstrong's mantra, "It's never as bad as it seems, and it's never as good as it seems," helps developers stay grounded and avoid distraction by market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>. The focus should remain on building products that make a difference and improve lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

Pollak openly shares his personal [[challenges_and_personal_experiences_in_developing_base | challenges and personal experiences in developing BASE]], including a period of intense anxiety, stress, and burnout leading up to [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]]'s launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. He highlights that even successful entrepreneurs face doubts and imperfections, emphasizing the human element of building in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.

## Future Predictions

Pollak holds a strong belief that "onchain is going to eat the internet," with billions of people onchain in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Unlike the internet's slower hardware deployment cycle, [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | crypto]] is an "app switch" – an instant software update for existing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. He predicts that within 12 months, the pieces of [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]]—low-cost L2s, smart wallets, and [[Impact of Bitcoin Layer Two Development | Base]] Names (onchain identities)—will work seamlessly together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44">[01:26:44]</a>. This integration will create "the most powerful login for developers ever" and the "most powerful user login ever," driving a "10x better" experience than anything currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>. This comprehensive package will enable the next generation of viral onchain products, leading to a dramatic transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.

From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

Kain Warwick, co-founder and CEO of Infinex, describes his company as "the crypto everything app," aiming to be a "One-Stop shop to store, use and trade over 1,000 crypto assets across any chain with just a few clicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His mission today is to "take DeFi and onchain platforms to the next level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This drive stems from a deep dissatisfaction that the technology he helped build isn't being widely used, stuck in a "little bubble of enthusiasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Acknowledging Past Mistakes

Warwick admits that he "helped to create a lot of the dumb ideas that are keeping us trapped" in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. He feels an obligation to "fix my mistakes" after realizing that much of what he thought was correct was "wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He considers his prior success as "stage one" and didn't realize there was a "stage two" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. After DeFi Summer, he had an "epiphany" that something was wrong with the strategy, though it never fully "crystallized" until he took a break from the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

He acknowledges that initial bootstrapping often requires building things that are "directionally wrong" to address the existing audience, primarily enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The problem is that the industry got "stuck" addressing that same audience repeatedly due to "bad incentives" for the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, proving Degen Spartan's "prophecy" of a three-year DeFi bear market correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## The Broken Market Structure and Incentives

Warwick believes the crypto market is currently in an "inadequate equilibrium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>, a term coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky, where the world moves into a bad state due to flawed incentive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>. Existing players are trapped by these incentives and cannot break them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.

He highlights the typical funding journey for good projects:
*   **Seed Round**: Projects raise at a "very cheap" valuation, often $50 million, making it a "positive EV bet" for angels and VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. However, only a few participants get access due to limited allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Series A**: Six to nine months later, they raise another round, still with limited participation from a select few funds and angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.
*   **Token Generation Event (TGE)**: The token launches at a significantly higher valuation (e.g., $5 billion FDV), orders of magnitude higher than the early rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. Only about 80 people worldwide participated in this "price discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

This structure means the vast majority of people can only buy tokens on the market after this massive price appreciation, leading to "down only" until "everyone utterly capitulates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. Projects are "trapped" because they can't raise at a higher initial valuation, and VCs won't allow it, compounded by regulatory constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

The "points meta" emerged as a workaround, allowing projects to incentivize community participation without directly selling tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. However, this also leads to "disillusioned people that have been farming for ages" who perceive a zero cost basis and dump their tokens, creating a "perverse incentive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

> "The solution is let people buy tokens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

## Infinex as the Solution

Infinex aims to solve this by creating a "game like points" scheme that grants people access to *buy* tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. This approach intends to ensure that participants "genuinely understand what they're participating in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:59">[01:04:59]</a>.

Infinex is designed to be "a better way to do crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>, especially for non-custodial storage. Warwick uses his mother as an example: she holds Bitcoin on Binance but is "sitting on a ticking time bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>. Infinex seeks to be a comfortable, non-custodial platform for long-term holders.

The "Holy Grail" for Infinex is to reach a point where, at the peak of the next cycle, new users are directed to Infinex as the go-to platform to buy Bitcoin and other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. However, he acknowledges that many people who lost money in the last cycle, particularly those who were not "lifers" in the space, may never return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

## Personal Reflections and Motivation

Warwick's personal journey has deeply influenced his current perspective. He now travels with his entire family, a change made after he got sober two years ago, as he didn't trust himself to travel alone and avoid relapsing into drug use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

He relates to the idea that successful founders often have "a high degree of autism" and "some sort of childhood trauma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>. Genetic testing indicated he is in the 100th percentile for all three autism spectrum clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. His "chaotic upbringing" and frequent travel as a child taught him to "mimic my environment" and be "hypervigilant" to control his surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:10">[02:11:10]</a>. This trained him to be a good salesperson and find shared interests by being genuinely curious about others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.

His passion for free diving, which he took up a few years ago, is another aspect of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. He loves the water, the discipline, and the control required for deep dives, acknowledging the inherent risks, including "shallow water blackout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>. He views such risks as a form of "crawling over broken glass" that leads to growth and ultimately makes things "beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

A core belief for Warwick is the importance of constantly [[Challenges and Mistakes in Crypto Investing | questioning assumptions]]. He states that the "most obvious thing, the most consensus thing is the most dangerous typically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>. He recalls a pivotal moment when he questioned the "fixed supply" assumption for ERC-20 tokens, realizing it was a "dumb" default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>. This led to the creation of hyperinflationary tokens, which fueled the "Renaissance of yield farming token incentives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>, acknowledging its positive and negative outcomes.

His motivation for returning to building in crypto is driven by a "fuel Barrel" full of skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a> for those who doubted him, aiming to "rip them right off" by proving them wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:48">[01:32:48]</a>. He admits this is "dark motivation" but acknowledges it as part of who he is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:58">[01:32:58]</a>.

## Contrarian Views and Industry Outlook

Warwick holds contrarian views on several crypto topics. He dismisses the quick "clout chasing" condemnation of celebrity coins, arguing that individuals who achieved success in highly competitive industries like music know how to gain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:02">[01:49:02]</a>. He believes that if they engage with crypto in good faith, they should be given a chance, rather than being punished for their past success or generalized with grifters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:31">[01:50:31]</a>. He also openly states that Vitalik Buterin is "wrong" about celebrity coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:29">[01:52:29]</a>.

Regarding the [[the_future_of_the_crypto_market | future of the crypto market]], he predicts a "very dangerous period" in the next 12 months, influenced by unpredictable macro factors and monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>. He expresses concern about tacit control and the "manufacturing of consent" by those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>. He laments that while some in crypto tried to educate regulators, they found that regulators "just want to kill us" and are actively trying to stop "Financial Freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.

Despite these challenges, he maintains that the world will move on, even if the U.S. isolates itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:47">[01:38:47]</a>. He refers to Bitcoin and crypto as a "financial cockroach" that cannot be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>. He believes that human nature, which is inherently speculative, ensures that market cycles will continue to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

The journey of building and adapting crypto products, particularly within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, is marked by constant iteration, strategic pivots, and a deep understanding of market dynamics. Pendle Finance, a decentralized project pioneering yield tokenization on Ethereum, serves as a case study in navigating these [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_crypto | challenges and opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Lessons from Pendle V1

When Pendle V1 launched in June 2021, it struggled to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The initial design was based on assumptions that proved problematic, such as expecting everything to be on-chain, which led to end-to-end transactions costing users up to $1,000 in gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This highlighted a significant hurdle in user adoption.

### The Kyber Experience and Market Disparity

The co-founder's prior experience at Kyber, a decentralized exchange launched in 2017, provided early insights into the disparities between decentralized and centralized platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. In 2018, a good day for Kyber saw $50,000-$100,000 in daily trading volume, while centralized exchanges like Binance were handling hundreds of millions or even billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This stark contrast led to doubts about the long-term viability of decentralized exchanges at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

After leaving Kyber in late 2018, the founder and his team explored numerous product ideas, both crypto-related and non-crypto, including a cold brew coffee business and cheesecake kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. None of these ventures worked out, emphasizing the difficulty of [[building_and_losing_a_crypto_project | launching successful projects]] and the need for a diversified approach to income during lean times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.

### Realization from DeFi Summer

A pivotal moment came during DeFi Summer in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. It became clear that many successful products, such as Uniswap, Aave (formerly Ethlend), and Compound, which emerged in 2017-2018, took two to three years to achieve product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This was a significant realization for the founder, who initially underestimated the need for money markets in a nascent trading environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. This experience instilled a resolve not to repeat the mistake of giving up too early on a meaningful idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

## Strategic Shifts and Pendle V2

Pendle V2 was launched in December 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This new version incorporated several key strategic changes:

*   **Iterative Product Development:** Recognizing that the initial product would not be the end state, the team committed to continuous improvement based on user interactions and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Investment in Business Development (BD) and Growth:** Unlike V1, which suffered from a complex UI/UX and a steep learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, V2 heavily invested in educational materials and expanded distribution outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The founder noted that "first-time founders focus on the product, second-time founders focus on distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Narratives and Partnerships:** A core strategy for Pendle V2 was to actively identify and position the protocol within dominant market narratives by tracking "big money movements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This involved:
    *   **Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs):** In early 2023, LSTs became a dominant trend, with protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool gaining prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Pendle affiliated itself with these players, partnering with Rocket Pool, Balancer, and Aura to market new product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
    *   **Arbitrum and Re-staking:** Subsequent narratives included Arbitrum and, more recently, the re-staking narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Pendle aimed to position itself where liquidity and capital were expected to flow, helping users capitalize on these opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### The Power of "Points" and Multipliers

Pendle's growth in 2023-2024 was significantly driven by its integration with "points" systems, popularized by protocols like EigenLayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>. Pendle tokenizes yield-bearing assets into Principal Tokens (PT) and Yield Tokens (YT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. By assigning points to the YT, users could gain exposure to future airdrops from underlying protocols (like EigenLayer and LRTs such as Ether.fi and Renzo) with potential multipliers, funneling significant liquidity into Pendle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>. This strategy made fixed-rate APYs on ETH, offered via PT, highly attractive (40-60%) due to the inverse relationship between PT and YT demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.

## Pendle's Growth Trajectory

From December 2022, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of around $5 million, Pendle grew to $250 million by the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. In 2024, driven by re-staking protocols like Ether.fi, Renzo, Kelp, and the rise of Ethena and Zircuit, Pendle's TVL approached $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>. Daily trading volume also surged from $200K-$300K to an average of $100-$200 million, with a peak of $182 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. The fully diluted valuation (FDV) climbed from $10 million to approximately $1.5-$1.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Market Potential

Pendle aims to continue its growth by identifying and partnering with promising protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. The team is focusing on:

*   **Re-staking Sector:** With EigenLayer proving effective in aggregating liquidity, Pendle sees immense potential, expecting to reach "tens of billions of dollars" in TVL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. This is based on the idea that much of Lido's $35 billion TVL could eventually be channeled into re-staking protocols that offer more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin Ecosystem:** Recognizing Bitcoin as the largest asset, Pendle is exploring how to help users make their dormant Bitcoin productive within emerging L1s and L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. The potential here is also estimated in the tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

Pendle sees itself as a neutral platform, facilitating liquidity and helping protocols go to market and bootstrap initial traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.

## Lessons Learned on Product Building and Mindset

The founder's journey highlights several crucial lessons for [[redefining_crypto_for_wider_adoption | building products]] in a rapidly changing market:

*   **Patience and Conviction:** [[Understanding and Embracing Change in the Crypto Market | Things take time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Despite early struggles and periods of low adoption, maintaining conviction in the core idea – bringing certainty to financial returns in crypto – was key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:53">[02:43:53]</a>.
*   **Distribution over Product (initially):** While a good product is the baseline, effective distribution and marketing are crucial for success. Many technologically sound crypto products fail due to a lack of attention and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **The "Product is the Community":** Founders like Monet and Ethena demonstrate that building a strong community and focusing on user acquisition are paramount. A robust community can attract initial liquidity, which then compounds to draw in more infrastructure and protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.
*   **Mindset and Self-Belief:** The founder's personal story as a swimmer who initially lacked belief in achieving Olympic success, contrasted with Joseph Schooling's gold medal win, underscores the importance of a strong mindset and self-belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:53">[03:44:53]</a>. In crypto, this translates to believing in one's vision and finding ways to execute despite [[impact_of_technological_advancements_and_market_patterns_on_crypto_investments | known and unknown challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>.
*   **Learning from Experience:** The founder stresses that insights like "sticking with Bitcoin and ETH" or "not everyone should be an entrepreneur" are often hard-won through direct experience of market volatility and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Shitcoin" Temptations:** The allure of quick gains from meme coins and risky tokens is a significant distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. For most investors, a disciplined approach focused on blue-chip assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum is a more sustainable [[investment_strategies_in_crypto_markets | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. This also ties into the philosophy of [[building_sustainable_crypto_portfolios | building sustainable crypto portfolios]].
*   **Responsible Financial Advice:** The founder's reluctance to manage family members' crypto investments highlights the inherent risks and responsibilities. Even advising friends on crypto can be fraught with peril, as individual behavior often leads to poor decisions despite good advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.

Pendle's journey exemplifies the dynamic and challenging nature of building and scaling a crypto project. Success hinges not just on technological innovation but on strategic adaptation, effective community engagement, and a resilient mindset in the face of constant market change.

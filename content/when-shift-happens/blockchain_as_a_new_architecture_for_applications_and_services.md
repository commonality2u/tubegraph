Hunter Horsley, co-founder and CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, describes public [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | blockchains]] as a significant new technology platform or development in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He believes that public [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | blockchains]] are one of those rare innovations that can change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## A New Computing Platform
Horsley views public [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | blockchains]] primarily from a technology vantage point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. He categorizes them as a new computing platform or architecture, similar to how the PC, the internet, and mobile technologies emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This new architecture presents an opportunity to build new applications and reimagine services that can be useful globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The advent and proliferation of the internet have created a context where this kind of architectural change makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

### Historical Parallels
Historically, new computing platforms emerge perhaps once a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>:
*   **The Personal Computer (1980s-1990s)**: Initially, people questioned the need for a mainframe in every home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Steve Jobs famously stated PCs would be used for storing recipes and balancing checkbooks, which later blossomed into much more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **The Internet** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
*   **Mobile Technology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
*   **Cloud/SaaS Architecture** for software delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

In this lineage, public [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | blockchains]] represent the next significant step, enabling new forms of applications and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Addressing the Internet's Challenges
The internet, while transformative, has also challenged old assumptions, particularly regarding human organization and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The "C Corp," a man-made invention from the 18th or 19th century, is a format for humans to pursue common interests and organize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. However, this model breaks down in the digital realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### The Facebook Groups Analogy
Horsley cites Facebook Groups as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. These groups, used by hundreds of millions of people for diverse purposes from expat communities to medical support, often develop their own "constitutions" (rules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. However, when disputes arise, the administrator can simply remove a member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The person wronged has no legal recourse, as there's no contract and the traditional constructs of organization built for the physical world break down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

In the digital world, valuable things like photos on a phone or meaningful online communities lack the "rule of law" or an organizing principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This contrasts with the physical world's legal systems and corporate structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### Blockchain as a Solution
[[blockchain_and_coordination | Blockchains]] offer a compelling new way for humans to undertake things together and trust each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. They provide a consensus mechanism that allows people globally to interact and expect rules to be followed, with consequences for violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This brings the ability to organize and enforce standards and rules globally, which is immensely valuable for trade, money, and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

Moreover, in an era of decreasing public trust in corporate and political leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | blockchains]] offer a structural solution by eliminating the need for central authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Public [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | blockchains]] are seen as being on the "right side" of how things should evolve in the internet age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

### Apolitical Money and Applications
Public [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | blockchains]] are expected to usher in an apolitical monetary instrument and apolitical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This means a world where people, regardless of location or identity, have access to a digital money they can use freely and applications they can trust without exploitation by companies or governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Bitwise's Mission
Bitwise aims to be a good steward of the [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | blockchain]] space, helping it develop to its full potential and enabling others to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Their mission is to help people get what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>, specifically by serving their clients and participating in meaningful ways as the world evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. They strive to be "the enduring and leading crypto manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>, helping investors access the space reliably and with high-quality solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.

They act as a "teaching assistant" to institutions and individual investors, helping them understand the evolving landscape of [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_ecosystem_challenges | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. Their belief is that if people understand what's happening in the space, they will see the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

George Nezes, Chief Scientist and co-founder at Mistin Labs, identifies the primary utility of [[Blockchain and Crypto Innovation | blockchain technology]] as a coordination layer for human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>. This perspective highlights blockchain's ability to facilitate secure and efficient interactions across time and space, fundamentally addressing long-standing challenges in human cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

## The Challenge of Coordination

For millennia, humanity has struggled with the inability to coordinate effectively across geographical distances and timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. Simple tasks like arranging a meeting between individuals in different cities or managing international business records have historically been complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>. Without a common, shared reference point, individuals and businesses faced difficulties in maintaining consistent records, tracking transactions, or ensuring agreement on shared states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

## Traditional Intermediaries

Historically, humanity addressed these coordination challenges through the emergence of centralized institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. Entities like banks and states served as intermediaries, helping people coordinate critical activities such as money transactions and shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. While solving the coordination problem, these intermediaries often extracted value and exerted power due to their central position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.

## Blockchain as a Coordination Layer

Blockchains, particularly modern ones like the Sui Network, offer a new solution to this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. They function as a "coordination layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>, providing a globally shared accounting system where rules are followed to add new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

This system allows participants to:
*   **Maintain Shared State**: Everyone sees the same updates to a shared state, enabling instantaneous coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. For example, records like business books can be transparently viewed by all parties, with transactions visible within milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.
*   **Define Custom Rules**: Users can define new rules (smart contracts) within the system for managing assets and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   **Operate Without Centralized Third Parties**: Unlike traditional systems, blockchains solve coordination problems without the need for intermediaries who can extract rent or change rules unilaterally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a>.

### The Sui Network's Role

The Sui Network excels as a coordination layer due to its speed, low cost, and high transaction capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. Its design makes it an optimal foundation for building decentralized applications that require extensive transaction processing and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.

### Walrus Protocol: An Application of Coordination

Walrus Protocol, a decentralized storage network, exemplifies how [[Blockchain as a new architecture for applications and services | blockchain-based coordination]] can address real-world problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. Older peer-to-peer file storage systems lacked a robust transaction system, making them unreliable and financially unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>. Walrus leverages Sui's transaction system to:
*   **Manage Economics**: It handles payments for storage, ensuring that decentralized storage nodes are compensated for their work and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.
*   **Track Resources**: Sui manages who owns storage space, what data should be stored, and the status of storage nodes (up/down, reliable/unreliable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
*   **Facilitate Data Handover**: The network coordinates the transfer of data between storage nodes as they join or leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:56">[01:24:56]</a>.

By relying on Sui, Walrus benefits from an effective coordination layer, allowing for the reliable and secure storage of large files (megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes) without the need to build its own blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>.

## Benefits of Blockchain Coordination

*   **Reduced Value Extraction**: Blockchains offer the potential to coordinate with fewer fees compared to traditional intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Security**: The coordination processes are secured, making them robust against adversaries unless extreme conditions are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. This means decisions derived from blockchain coordination are reliable and tamper-proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Efficiency**: A blockchain-based system allows for much greater transparency and efficiency in economic activities, moving beyond outdated methods like PDFs and emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>.
*   **Open Interfaces for Commerce**: This technology facilitates a future where production and commerce are coordinated through open interfaces, enabling seamless interactions like funding a widget's production in one country, shipping it globally, and managing its distribution, all coordinated via a common ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>.

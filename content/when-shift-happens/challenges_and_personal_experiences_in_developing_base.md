Jesse Pollak, the creator of Base, Coinbase's Ethereum Layer 2 Network, has openly discussed the significant personal and professional [[challenges_of_building_in_the_web3_space | challenges of building in the web3 space]] and his [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | personal experiences with entrepreneurship and business challenges]] during its development. BASE aims to build a global onchain economy that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom by upgrading outdated economic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

## Early Struggles and Doubts

The initial year of building Base, from 2021 to 2022, was particularly challenging for Pollak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. During this "idea phase," he constantly faced pressure from Coinbase's CEO, Brian Armstrong, and the chief product officer to present an "innovative new thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. Despite trying various approaches, Pollak felt he didn't have the answers, and his attempts kept failing, leading to periods of high anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>. This environment led him to consider quitting, and he had to be talked "off the ledge" by his wife and colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.

### Experiencing Burnout

The period leading up to Base's mainnet launch in August 2023 was the most anxious and stressful time in Pollak's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. He worked incredibly hard, feeling a strong urgency to get the platform into the world and get the flywheel spinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>. This intense period led to significant physical and mental strain:
*   He stopped eating and was constantly nauseous and anxious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.
*   He lost 15-20 pounds and struggled to concentrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.
*   He found himself becoming pessimistic and negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>.
*   There were days he would curl up in a ball on the couch, unable to do anything but try to sleep to escape the feeling of sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

Despite the successful launch of Base, Pollak was not doing well internally, prompting an intervention from his wife who highlighted his unhealthiness and lack of presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. This led him to take a week off, start therapy again, meditate, and increase his workouts to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>.

## Personal Background and Work Ethic

Pollak's upbringing and past experiences significantly shaped his approach to work:
*   **Quaker Upbringing**: Raised in Washington D.C., he attended a Quaker school where values like simplicity, peace, integrity, community, equality, and stewardship were emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This instilled a desire to "make the world the best it can be" and work collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
*   **Parental Influence**: His mother was a midwife who delivered thousands of babies, and his father was a labor lawyer representing unions, instilling in him the belief he could accomplish anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Soccer**: Playing competitive soccer from age four through college, despite being a "B plus at best" player, taught him the value of hard work and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. The experience of working hard but still being benched "put something in my head" about the necessity of relentless effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.
*   **Technical Background and Leadership**: While originally technical, Pollak realized his strengths lay in product intuition, technical architecture at a high level, and crucially, working with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. He loves bringing people together, coaching them, and helping them achieve incredible things, while relying on deeply technical individuals for detailed execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
*   **Cannabis for Generative Thinking**: Pollak uses cannabis as a tool to shift his thinking and open up new pathways, finding it a "generative experience" for problem-solving and generating ideas, often combined with physical exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:52">[02:18:52]</a>.

## The "Aha Moment" and Iterative Development of BASE

The journey to Base involved multiple failed ideas. Pollak initially pitched turning Coinbase into a DAO with a billion dollars and 60 employees, which was rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Other ideas included an app marketplace and identity solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

The "aha moment" for Base came after repeatedly encountering the same problem: the difficulty of building on-chain products at Coinbase's scale to reach 100 million users and integrate seamlessly with Coinbase's existing product suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This led to the realization that a platform was needed to enable these products. An internal testnet, initially called Coinet and then Baset, was launched to make it easier for Coinbase developers to build on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This solidified the decision to build a platform that would not only help Coinbase but also make it easy for "everyone to come on chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Navigating Centralization vs. Decentralization

A unique [[challenges_and_solutions_in_entrepreneurship | challenge]] for Base is the inherent tension of a NASDAQ-listed, regulated, and largely centralized company like Coinbase launching a decentralized Layer 2 Network for [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum development and challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Pollak views this as both Base's greatest strength and greatest risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>:
*   **Strength**: Coinbase serves as an "incredible first customer," providing a playbook for other large companies to move on-chain and leveraging its distribution, efficiency, and resources for aggressive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Risk**: The danger of getting "lost in the sauce of centralization" and treating Base merely as a traditional product offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. A global on-chain economy must be decentralized to ensure neutrality and participation from all countries, corporations, and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

Brian Armstrong's strong stance on decentralization is crucial, as he continually emphasizes the need to decentralize Base to avoid wasting time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Base is committed to building as an Ethereum L2 and on the OP Stack to bootstrap decentralization and ensure open-source contributions benefit everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. Pollak believes actions speak louder than words, pointing to milestones like fault proofs on testnet and progress on the security council as evidence of their commitment to decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Key Focus Areas for the BASE Ecosystem

Pollak's biggest criticisms and focus for the Base ecosystem today are:
1.  **Build Something People Want**: Crypto builders can get "lost in the sauce" of economic incentives and game theory. The primary focus should be on creating products that genuinely solve real problems for everyday people and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
2.  **Make it Easy to Use**: On-chain products must be *better* than existing online products, not just "good for crypto," to drive widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Innovations like smart wallets, Base Names, and L2s are enabling this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
3.  **Onboard New People**: Everyone has a "moral responsibility" to act as a missionary, explaining the new on-chain economy to friends and family. This viral adoption is essential for growth and provides invaluable feedback on product usability and desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Tokens and Product Development Philosophy

Pollak believes that the industry has suffered from putting the "token ahead of the product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Launching a token or going public before achieving product-market fit creates a "toxic and incredibly negative" environment for building great products, akin to an early-stage startup going public prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Base, along with other successful projects like PolyMarket, has demonstrated that focusing on building a great product, even if it takes years, leads to success without an immediate token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. The "free money" from tokens is "expensive money" due to the distraction and dilution it causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. While tokens and on-chain governance are powerful tools that will eventually lead to massive efficiency gains over traditional legal structures, they should be applied *after* a product has proven its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Optimism and Navigating Volatility

Pollak emphasizes the importance of cultivating optimism in the volatile crypto industry. His key advice is to avoid focusing on trading or price charts, as these are "PVP games" outside of one's control that negatively impact mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Instead, he advocates for a "builder mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>:
*   **Focus on what you can control**: Identify your sphere of influence and commit to making daily progress, no matter how small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace continuous improvement**: Incremental improvements in a product or following build a habit of progress that fuels optimism and allows for extrapolation of future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage openness of crypto**: The crypto space is uniquely open to builders; showing genuine intent to contribute attracts support from founders and leaders, fostering a sense of collective purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

To manage the emotional roller coaster of building in crypto, Pollak applies Brian Armstrong's mantra: "It's Never As Good As It Seems and it's Never As Bad As It Seems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This stoic approach helps avoid getting "lost in the sauce" of market volatility and instead focus on building impactful products that serve customers and improve the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## The Mission of BASE and its Impact on Global Onchain Economy

The core [[the_mission_of_base_and_its_impact_on_global_onchain_economy | mission of Base]] is to build a global on-chain economy that increases innovation, creativity, and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This involves upgrading economic systems that are often outdated, slow, expensive, frustrating, discriminatory, and offer unequal access based on location or technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

Pollak believes that on-chain will "eat the internet" within the next five years, with billions of people joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Unlike the internet's slower hardware deployment, crypto leverages existing internet infrastructure, making it a "software update" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. He predicts an inflection point where user experiences become good enough to see viral on-chain social products emerge rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

Within the next 12 months, Pollak foresees all pieces of Base's technology (low-cost L2s, infinitely programmable smart wallets, and single on-chain identities like Base Names) working seamlessly together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This combination will create the best consumer experience for financial and login apps ever, alongside the most powerful developer experience, enabling developers to integrate a single line of code for powerful features like payments and KYC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This will unlock the next generation of on-chain products, making them 10x better than anything currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

Within the evolving landscape of crypto, two contrasting approaches to development and community engagement are identified: Player vs. Player (PVP) and People Power People (PPP). Understanding these distinctions is crucial for the industry's sustainable growth.

## The PVP (Player vs. Player) Approach

The PVP approach, or "players versus players," is characterized by an adversarial mindset, similar to a game like Counter-Strike where the goal is to "kill" the opponent by getting the first shot [00:44:27]. In crypto, this translates to an environment rife with distrust [00:45:08].

### Characteristics of PVP
*   **Insider Game**: A significant criticism of the crypto industry is its perception as an "insider game," not unlike traditional finance [00:42:20]. This means success is often seen as dependent on who is funding you rather than your vision [00:00:46].
*   **Short-Term Mindset**: In a PVP environment, participants often aim to "get in early and dump on someone else who is late to the party" [00:42:29], viewing later investors as "exit liquidity" [00:42:32].
*   **Distrust and Manipulation**: There's a pervasive distrust within the community, often between users, investors, and teams [00:45:11]. This leads to a "trigger alert" mentality, where everyone's finger is on the sell button, anticipating others dumping first [00:45:32].
*   **Acceptance of Bad Behavior**: The industry has often accepted "bad behaviors," such as allowing influencers to dump tokens just to create a pump [00:41:01]. This enablement of problematic actions is seen as the community's fault [00:41:13].

## The PPP (People Power People) Approach

In stark contrast, the PPP approach, also referred to as "Player Power People" or the "garden" analogy, emphasizes collaboration and long-term growth for mutual benefit [00:47:44].

### Characteristics of PPP
*   **Community and Ecosystem Focus**: PPP is like cultivating a garden, starting with seeds and nurturing them to grow into a vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystem [00:47:44]. It's about creating a healthy balance between taking what's needed (like eating fruits) and replenishing (like trimming grass or adding compost) [00:48:41].
*   **Shared Success (Infinite Game)**: In a PPP environment, the goal is to make "everyone win together" [00:49:50]. This is an "infinite game" with no inherent limits to its potential, as seen with protocols like [[foundational_aspects_of_building_and_maintaining_crypto_funds | Bitcoin]] and Ethereum, which grew through a vast network of people who built for, invested in, and evangelized the protocol [00:49:54].
*   **Resilience and Long-Term Conviction**: PPP cultures are formed not during market peaks but during downturns, where committed individuals and teams remain [00:52:55]. This approach aligns with the "Redwood trees" analogy, where periodic "fires" (market downturns) clear out bad actors and foster stronger, more resilient communities, much like a forest fire helps the Redwoods by clearing undergrowth and allowing more light [00:56:11].
*   **[[cultural_dichotomy_within_the_crypto_community | Zero Culture]]**: This mindset embodies "zero expectations, zero promises, and zero ego" [01:00:45]. It acts as a counterculture to the "moon only" mentality, promoting resilience by preventing broken hearts and shattered resilience when expectations are not met [01:02:00]. This approach is crucial for investors to buy on the low and sell on the high, as it removes emotional attachment to price pumps [01:03:00].

## Transitioning from PVP to PPP

Shifting the entire industry from a PVP to a PPP mindset presents [[challenges_and_perspectives_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges]].
*   **Embracing Failure and Downturns**: The industry needs to become comfortable with "red candles" and failures, recognizing that downturns reveal who is genuinely committed to the PPP approach [00:53:52].
*   **Rejecting Harmful Behaviors**: It's crucial for the industry to stop accepting adversarial behaviors, such as influencers receiving tokens for pumps or opaque token distributions [00:54:13]. Accepting "poisonous characters" for temporary gains needs to stop [00:54:40].
*   **Building Resilience**: High expectations lead to low resilience, which is detrimental in business [00:04:12]. Cultivating a "zero culture" helps build this essential quality [01:05:04].

## The Role of Memes and Utility

Every coin, including [[foundational_aspects_of_building_and_maintaining_crypto_funds | Bitcoin]] and USD, is fundamentally a "meme coin" [00:00:01]. A meme is something a critical mass of people agrees on and believes in [01:12:32].
*   **Money as Energy**: Money is defined as "energy," largely human energy and conviction. When a group of people deeply believe in something and put conviction behind it, money emerges [00:31:31].
*   **Utility Supports the Meme**: The biggest delusion is viewing utility and meme as separate or competing forces [01:21:00]. Instead, the utility of a protocol, like Solana's, contributes to its meme [01:15:02]. A successful system creates a virtuous cycle where the "meme unifies" people, and the utility (culture, community, usage, etc.) supports and enhances that meme [01:22:41].

Ultimately, the goal is to create a "global unified market" (GUM) where all asset classes are easily accessible, fostering ultimate freedom through [[decentralization_vs_centralization_in_crypto_platforms | decentralized finance (DeFi)]] [01:34:07]. This future requires a collective shift towards a PPP mindset, driven by authenticity, resilience, and a willingness to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth.

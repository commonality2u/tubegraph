Joe McCann, founder, CEO, and CIO at Asymetric, the top-performing hedge fund globally in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, emphasizes that understanding and managing risk is paramount for successful investing, particularly in volatile markets like crypto.

## Risk Tolerance and Position Sizing
McCann highlights that the amount of money an investor has significantly impacts their risk tolerance for speculative assets like meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For someone with $100 million, investing $50 million in a volatile asset like Bonk and being wrong could be catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, investing $2 million in the same asset, even if it drops by 50%, is "not the end of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. If it goes up 100x, it's a massive win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This illustrates the importance of sizing investments appropriately to one's overall capital and risk capacity.

## Navigating Volatility vs. Chaos
McCann thrives in [[the_psychology_and_strategies_of_handling_investment_volatility | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:48">[01:19:48]</a>, distinguishing it from chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. Volatility, in his view, implies some constraint around the environment, while chaos is difficult to define or manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:07">[02:01:07]</a>. His childhood, marked by frequent moves and destabilization, instilled in him an ability to adapt to volatile environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Crypto, being "arguably the most volatile asset class in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>, is perfectly suited for his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>.

### Learning from Nassim Nicholas Taleb
McCann is a big fan of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, particularly for his articulation of principles regarding randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. He challenges the notion of pinpointing exact reasons for market movements, stating it's "utter nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:37">[02:11:37]</a>. Markets often operate with "stochastic randomness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:28">[02:26:28]</a>. This perspective informs his view that traditional financial models, like price-to-earnings ratios, often don't work when shoehorned into crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:41">[02:29:41]</a>. Instead, he advocates for [[importance_of_firstprinciple_thinking_in_investments | first-principles thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:13">[02:31:13]</a>.

## Case Study: FTX Collapse and Solana
The FTX collapse in late 2022 presented a major opportunity for McCann and Asymetric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:55">[03:57:55]</a>. Despite the market turmoil, the fundamentals of Solana, a blockchain heavily associated with FTX, had not changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:11">[04:10:11]</a>. They recognized the importance of Solana as an underlying operating system for smart contracts due to its deterministic cost and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:29">[04:26:29]</a>.

McCann and his team began buying Solana when it traded between $8 and $11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:02">[04:54:02]</a>. Their confidence stemmed from:
*   **Understanding Counterparty Risk:** Having experienced the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), they understood [[risks_of_crypto_investment | counterparty risk]] and flattened their entire book to avoid bankruptcy proceedings with broker-dealers when FTX issues emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>.
*   **Fundamental Analysis:** They believed Solana's technical architecture (monolithic stack) was superior for scaling a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Price Levels:** They had pre-determined comfortable price levels for owning certain assets regardless of external events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

This combination of understanding various forms of [[managing_risk_and_making_informed_investment_decisions | risk]], managing it, and acting when price hit a certain level despite external "chaos" led to a highly successful trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:52">[04:52:52]</a>.

## Secrets to Successful Crypto Investing
McCann shares several "secrets" for new crypto investors, all revolving around a deep understanding of risk and human psychology:

### 1. Skin in the Game
True learning in trading and investing comes from practical experience, not just books or courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. [[the_psychology_behind_crypto_investments | Trading]] is emotional, and the only way to understand it is to "feel it" by putting your own money in the market and making mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

### 2. Blow Up Your Account (Twice)
McCann candidly states that aspiring traders need to blow up their accounts at least twice to truly learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a>. His own painful experiences, including losing his account due to leveraging a stock that gapped down, taught him that you "have no control" over certain market events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. Recognizing this lack of control is crucial for getting into a "flow state" with the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### 3. Master Your Emotions and Go Against Your Gut
When market events cause panic, most people sell at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. Developing the ability to detach your mental framework from emotion allows you to recognize panic as an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>. Instead of panicking, one might rebalance their portfolio or shift positions to benefit from a reflexive bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. He admits that even he, a seasoned trader, experiences euphoric or panic moments, but the difference is the ability to master and control that emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

### 4. Understand Loss Aversion
[[the_psychology_and_strategies_of_handling_investment_volatility | Loss aversion]] is the human tendency to "hate losing more than we enjoy winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. This emotional construct causes people to justify staying in losing positions rather than admitting they were wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. McCann states, "There's nothing wrong with being wrong; staying wrong is a sin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.

### 5. Know Your Exit in Advance
Before entering a trade, it's crucial to know your exit strategy, both for profit-taking and loss-cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. If an investor sets a 10% stop-loss and a 20% profit target, there should be no emotion involved in executing those exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. Failure to pre-define exits leads to emotional decision-making, causing investors to hold losing trades or miss profit-taking opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>. This concept is likened to "paying the Gods" in trading, a superstitious idea that encourages taking small profits and accepting small losses to stay in rhythm with the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>.

## Asymetric's Risk Management Approach
Asymetric, McCann's fund, focuses on [[investment_strategies_and_managing_risk_in_crypto | generating returns for its Limited Partners (LPs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>. They operate at the "intersection of technology, culture, and capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. Their strategy for investing in meme coins like Bonk involves a strict concentration risk policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>:
*   **Concentration Risk Policy:** For any asset in the top 20 by market cap, they invest at most 2% of the fund's AUM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. This means if a $2 million investment drops 50%, it's not catastrophic, but if it goes up 100x, it's a massive win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. This adherence to [[the_importance_of_investor_alignment | risk management]] allows them to pursue high-return opportunities while protecting capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.

McCann also sees crypto as the best expression of macro trends today, offering the best risk-adjusted return compared to other asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. While their primary focus is crypto, their background as a macro fund allows them the flexibility to shift exposure to traditional macro products (e.g., interest rates, FX) if crypto markets enter a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:57">[04:59:57]</a>.

The [[the_current_state_and_future_of_the_crypto_industry | crypto industry]] is expected to undergo significant changes and consolidation, with a strong focus on [[future_prospects_and_trends_in_the_crypto_market | technological advancements]], user experience, and community building, according to Ignas Terus, Head of Public Liaison for Mantle.

## Market Consolidation and Longevity
In the next five years, a major trend in the [[future_prospects_and_trends_in_the_crypto_market | crypto world]] will be consolidation across Layer 1s and Layer 2s, a natural progression seen in every technology sector [0:45:43]. The ability to survive and build through both bull and bear market cycles will determine which projects remain [0:46:27].

Organizations with strong financial foundations, sound decision-making, and a loyal community are best positioned to thrive long-term [0:46:42]. Mantle, for instance, has a substantial financial cushion, allowing for deliberate, long-term building decisions rather than being swayed by fleeting fads [0:44:52]. Maintaining separate budgets for engineering and marketing is also crucial for sustaining development during market downturns [0:47:19]. Solid partnerships are viewed as a critical asset for growth [0:48:03].

## Ethereum's Continued Dominance
Ethereum is firmly established as the "world computer" where premium smart contracts will run [0:30:40]. Despite the emergence of numerous alternative Layer 1s, none are expected to challenge Ethereum's supremacy in the foreseeable [[future_prospects_and_trends_in_the_crypto_market | future]] [0:51:13]. Other Layer 1s are likely to find specific niches rather than replacing Ethereum [0:51:46].

### The Rise of Layer 2s
Layer 2 solutions are now considered an integral part of Ethereum's ecosystem [0:46:23]. The recent Dencun upgrade has made Layer 2s even cheaper than Solana, opening up significant opportunities for the Ethereum ecosystem [0:31:10]. Layer 2s are designed to hyperscale the Ethereum network, enabling mass adoption by allowing users to transact faster and at a fraction of the cost [0:01:50], [0:31:36].

## Enhancing User Experience
A critical challenge for the [[the_current_state_and_future_of_the_crypto_industry | crypto industry]] is improving the user experience, particularly concerning the complexity of navigating multiple Layer 2s and bridging assets [0:57:42], [1:01:23]. Industry leaders are actively working on solutions like account abstraction and "smart wallets" to abstract away these technical complexities [0:58:27]. The goal is for users to interact with Ethereum primarily through Layer 2s without even realizing it [1:03:11]. Intent-based protocols, which find the optimal routing for a user's desired action across different blockchains, are a key area of investment [0:59:21].

## The Role of Meme Coins
Meme coins, often perceived as "stupid," are acknowledged as a powerful tool for capturing attentionâ€”a scarce resource in the market [1:08:29]. Their ability to generate hype and potential price increases serves as a "gateway drug" for new users, attracting them through speculation [1:09:52], [1:10:05]. A portion of these new users will then stay for the underlying technology, community, and "memes" themselves [1:10:44], [1:11:05]. This storytelling and community-building aspect of meme coins fulfills an innate human need for belonging [1:13:18].

## Market Predictions
Based on historical trends, particularly around Bitcoin halving events, the [[cryptocurrency_market_trends_and_predictions | crypto market]] is expected to be in a full bull run for the next 12 months [1:39:22]. Bitcoin itself is predicted to at least double, if not triple, its current price [1:39:44].

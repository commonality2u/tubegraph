Her journey highlights the evolving landscape of digital influence and the [[founders_journey_from_traditional_careers_to_crypto | shift from traditional careers to crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Early Life and Move to Singapore

Irene Zhao moved to Singapore at the age of 15 in 2008, having received a scholarship from the Singapore government to pursue her studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Her father, who had done his MBA at the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2005, believed Singapore was an ideal place for her education and career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Although she was a good student in China, she initially struggled with the different curriculum and English language in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. She later attended NUS, studying Communication and New Media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

Comparing China's rapid evolution to Singapore, Zhao notes the significant changes in China, particularly the widespread adoption of cashless payments like Alipay and WeChat Pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Despite the fast pace of change, she prefers Singapore due to her established connections and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. She also observes that many Chinese billionaires and entrepreneurs are moving to Singapore and Hong Kong due to less entrepreneur-friendly policies in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

## Transition to Traditional Finance

After graduating from university, Irene started her career in traditional finance as an iron ore broker at a brokerage firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. This role, which she held for four years from 2017 to 2021, was front-office, focusing on interacting with people rather than complex calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. She enjoyed the interpersonal aspects of the job, particularly interacting with high-level individuals, but found dealing with commodities like rocks and steel mills to be boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

## Influencer Journey and Personal Branding

Irene Zhao's influencer journey began after university, which she considers "pretty late" compared to most influencers who start at 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[01:00:40]</a>. While modeling part-time during university, she posted random photos on Instagram, some of which went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[01:00:43]</a>. This led to her first paid sponsorship for a coconut drink, earning her $80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. She quickly analyzed content that attracted more followers and began posting in that direction, adopting an "innocent Google look" or "Japanese school girl" persona, which was different from her real personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. This strategy helped her gain 10,000 followers from just one post at her peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

She maintained a private personal life while building her [[the_impact_and_importance_of_personal_branding_in_finance_and_crypto | personal brand]], only sharing what she wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. However, she disliked the "fake persona" aspect of the influencer game, the pressure to post more revealing photos for attention, and taking sponsorships for products that didn't align with her personal brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. The influencer world is competitive, with thousands of "pretty girls online" vying for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>. She stresses that success depends on managing one's brand well and securing high-end brand partnerships, often requiring influencers to share intimate details of their lives to engage female followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.

## Entry into Crypto and NFTs

Irene Zhao entered crypto in early 2021 as a CMO for a DeFi project, brought in by university friends who needed help marketing their project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:40]</a>. Initially, she didn't enjoy DeFi, finding it complex and not suitable for everyone, especially those without a finance background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">[33:38:00]</a>.

Her real entry into NFTs came when a friend sent her a CryptoPunk for free in July 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:29:00">[34:29:00]</a>. She was fascinated by the value and realized that NFTs offered a significant opportunity for creators to monetize their content and build communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:22:00">[35:22:00]</a>.

### The "IrinDao" Experiment

Irene launched the "IrinDao" NFT collection, a free mint for her fans, as a social experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>. The collection minted out in 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>. The project went viral after she sent one of the NFTs to McNuggets, a prominent crypto figure, who posted about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>. Logan Paul saw the post and bought 29 IrinDao NFTs, driving the price up to 5 ETH at its peak, with Logan Paul spending around $230,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:59:00">[39:59:00]</a>.

This success established her as one of the first creators to successfully launch a creative NFT, inspiring a "synth movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33:00">[40:33:00]</a>. This experience was a pivotal moment, leading her to decide to build a company in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57:00">[40:57:00]</a>. She recognized the complexity of launching NFTs, involving smart contract developers, OpenSea, Discord, and Snapshot for community engagement, and aimed to simplify this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:14:00">[41:14:00]</a>.

## Founding So-Col

So-Col, short for "Social Collectible," is a platform designed to allow creators to launch their own NFT collections with ease, effectively "at the click of a button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>. The core idea is to shift content ownership from centralized social media platforms (like Instagram, Twitter, YouTube) to creators and their fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a>. This fosters a unique relationship where fans, as owners of the content, become advocates for the creator, leading to "evangelism on steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Business Evolution
So-Col has faced significant challenges, particularly during the crypto bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>. A major hurdle is the public's perception of NFTs as scams or valueless, especially among fans of traditional content like K-Pop, who often strongly oppose their idols' involvement in NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:14:00">[45:14:00]</a>.

Initially focused on B2C (creator-to-fan), So-Col has pivoted to include B2B services, working with larger companies that are already invested in and believe in the future of NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:24:00">[46:24:00]</a>. Examples include partnering with Amber Lounge for an F1 party NFT collection that offers lifelong membership benefits, and Nothing, a phone brand, which air-drops NFTs to early community members redeemable for tangible items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:28:00">[47:28:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Journey and Lessons Learned

Irene Zhao's transition from influencer to entrepreneur has been transformative. She no longer stresses about likes or brand deals, but now faces a multitude of responsibilities, including investors, partners, and various projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:05:00">[49:05:00]</a>.

### Fundraising Challenges
Her fundraising journey, an [[insights_on_the_entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges_in_the_crypto_space | entrepreneurial journey with challenges in the crypto space]], began when Web3 social (SocialFi) was not yet popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:41:00">[51:41:00]</a>. Animoca Brands was So-Col's first investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00:00">[52:00:00]</a>. After the success of IrinDao, fundraising became easier, with So-Col being oversubscribed for its seed round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:23:00">[52:23:00]</a>. However, the market shifted dramatically after events like Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Luna, and FTX collapses, ushering in a "real crypto winter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>. Fundraising during this period, particularly for dApps, remains challenging compared to infrastructure or Layer 1 projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:23:00">[54:23:00]</a>.

### Navigating the Crypto Market
Zhao emphasizes the importance of conviction and adapting to rapidly changing narratives in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>. She views a bear market as a good time to build, as there is "much less noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:26:00">[55:26:00]</a>. She recalled rapidly expanding in the US in April 2022 due to high demand from celebrities and Netflix shows for NFT businesses, leading to a high burn rate of $200,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:01:00">[57:01:00]</a>. However, when this didn't yield sufficient traction, they cut costs and refocused on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:45:00">[57:45:00]</a>.

The crypto world is an "emotional roller coaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:40:00">[59:40:00]</a>. Zhao deals with mental health by practicing acceptance—accepting past losses, the difficulties of a bear market, and the current challenges of NFT adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:53:00">[59:53:00]</a>. She advises ignoring the noise of others' perceived success and focusing on personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

### Personal Philosophy
Zhao believes that "shortcut is actually the longest road to success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>, advocating for consistent, hard work. Her key takeaway from her [[entrepreneurship_lessons_in_the_crypto_space | entrepreneurial persistence and success in crypto]] is to "ignore the noise and do whatever you are doing right now," focusing on self-improvement rather than comparing oneself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. She finds happiness not in external achievements or wealth, but in continuous personal growth and inspiring others to embark on their own ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.

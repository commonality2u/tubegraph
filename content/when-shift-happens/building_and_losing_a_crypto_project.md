The journey of building and adapting a crypto project involves navigating market volatility, managing community expectations, and pivoting strategies to ensure long-term viability. One founder describes their path as an "accidental founder" in the crypto space, detailing the highs and lows of an NFT project, the subsequent shift to a consulting firm, and the evolution into a multifaceted incubator and accelerator.

## Accidental Genesis: The Gojira NFT Collection

The founder's entry into the crypto space began unexpectedly in 2021, when they became an "accidental founder" of an NFT collection [00:44:00]. Having observed the success of ape-themed NFTs like Bored Apes and CyberKongs, they wondered why no one had explored the Godzilla or Kaiju theme [00:28:40]. Initially, they reached out to the actual founder of a Godzilla-themed NFT project, Jamie, seeking whitelist spots for their small Discord community of 50 people [00:28:20].

Upon discovering Jamie was a solo founder with little experience in NFT launch mechanics, the speaker offered to join as an advisor, leveraging their five years in crypto and nine months in NFTs [00:29:31]. Within three weeks, they became a co-founder, taking over Discord management and Twitter, and quickly driving the project to virality [00:31:58].

### Launch and Early Success
The Gojira collection launched with a small supply of 333 NFTs at 0.05 ETH, gaining iconic status in 2022 for pioneering small collections [00:30:03]. They used a "lazy mint" approach, manually listing all NFTs on OpenSea without developers [00:30:17]. A key marketing strategy involved announcing the Twitter account would go private in 8 hours, which drew significant attention and followers [00:30:40]. The project sold out and saw its Genesis NFTs reach a 25 ETH floor price and a $150 million market cap [00:32:27, 00:37:32].

Financially, the founders only held one NFT each, with no initial treasury beyond 15 ETH from the initial mint [00:32:30]. They primarily relied on royalties, which at one point generated about 150 ETH from approximately 10,000 ETH in volume, before the royalty system was disrupted by marketplaces like X2Y2 [00:33:19]. These funds were placed in a multi-signature treasury controlled by community members who doxxed themselves, with transparent monthly financial reports [00:34:09].

## Challenges and Shifts in the Market

The founder realized the immense responsibility of managing a project where NFTs were valued at significant amounts, creating a sense of duty to their community [00:35:27]. This led them to quit their job in June 2022, only for the crypto market to crash shortly thereafter, with Ethereum dropping from $3,000 to $800 within a month [00:37:36].

Adding to the challenges, their project was delisted from OpenSea due to a fake DMCA claim, a major setback at the time that took 40 days to resolve with lawyers [00:38:05]. The period saw a shift from lucrative NFT mints, where a 0.1 ETH mint could flip for 0.15-0.2 ETH, to pure speculation and lottery tickets [00:41:40]. The founder noted that the NFT meta was more enjoyable than the subsequent memecoin meta, despite both being driven by speculation [00:36:19].

## Pivoting to Consulting and Investment Syndicates

Facing an uncertain market, the team realized that continuously launching new NFT collections or relying solely on royalties was unsustainable [00:40:21]. Their initial lack of a clear business idea for the NFT project, common for many in the space, necessitated a pivot [00:39:35].

They transitioned into a consulting firm, advising other crypto projects on launches, specifically targeting white-list spots for their community in exchange for USD payments [00:40:36]. This allowed them to launch over 20 projects, secure high allocations of whitelist spots (300 to 1000 per project) for their community, and gain valuable connections in both Web2 and Web3 [00:40:47]. A key learning was that Web2 companies often wanted a presence in Web3 simply to be seen as adopting new technology, rather than having a clear business model [00:42:49]. However, a significant drawback was the inability to control the outcomes of the projects they consulted for [00:44:12].

In 2023, they launched [[foundational_aspects_of_building_and_maintaining_crypto_funds | PG Capital]], an investment syndicate, inspired by projects like Neotokyo which offered early access to deals [00:45:55]. The goal was to provide community members access to pre-seed or seed rounds at lower valuations, rather than inflated public IDO prices [00:44:50]. While they experienced significant wins, such as a 50x return on a Supra investment, the challenge of managing diverse project outcomes and administrative overhead for limited returns was immense [00:47:56].

So like people have lost their money and you have done all this admin work for nothing. Plus most of these project never launch." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>

## Evolution to Redacted: An Incubator and Accelerator

Recognizing the limitations of consulting and syndicates, and the need for greater control and scale, the team conceived "Redacted" [00:48:46]. Acquired by Animoca and Spartan, with Polygon's support, Redacted is envisioned as a single entity with a native token, encompassing a series of products built or co-built in partnership with other teams [00:48:38, 00:50:00].

Redacted aims to overcome previous challenges by:
*   **Controlling Outcomes**: Taking equity in partner businesses and co-building products from A to Z, rather than just consulting [00:50:35].
*   **Adaptability**: The name "Redacted" signifies its fluid nature, not limited to one specific sector like gaming or DeFi, allowing it to adapt to changing metas [00:51:47].
*   **Revenue Diversification**: Generating revenue share, equity, and tokens from 14+ products across DeFi, AI, and Web2 sectors, including a Web2 app called Kumu [00:50:41, 00:52:36].
*   **Team Structure**: Each product has its own team (5-15 people), preventing burnout for the core Redacted team [00:51:25].
*   **Token Utility**: The Redacted token acts as an "attention" and "reward economy" token, incentivizing users to engage with ecosystem products that may not have their own tokens [00:52:56]. Holders can receive benefits like 25% discounts on platform fees [00:55:08].

## Managing Failure and Founder Alignment

A significant [[managing_criticism_and_risk_as_a_crypto_founder | challenge]] for Redacted is when a product's token fails, despite the product itself having real value or partnerships, as the blame often falls on the larger Redacted entity [00:55:37]. The founder believes the most important action for a founder is to deliver on promises and avoid defending token prices using treasury funds, which can lead to project failure [00:58:18].

To align founder and investor interests and demonstrate commitment, the founder publicly commits to:
*   Using their $10,000 monthly salary and an additional $10,000 from personal savings to buy Redacted tokens from the open market for a minimum of six months [00:59:26].
*   Implementing a 12-month cliff for team tokens. If the project doesn't hit a $100 million market cap (not FDV) within 24 months, all team tokens are burned [00:59:53]. Further unlocks (10% of team tokens) only occur for every additional $100 million in market cap, requiring a billion-dollar market cap for full team token unlock [01:00:47].

This structure ensures the team is incentivized by product success and long-term value creation rather than short-term token speculation [01:04:08]. The founder highlights that despite potential token burns, the project has a 3-4 year runway from raised funds to continue building and pivoting, regardless of market conditions [01:05:08].

## Future Outlook and Key Takeaways

The future of Redacted is viewed through the lens of a business, prioritizing [[building_and_adapting_crypto_products_amid_market_changes | resilience]] and adaptability [01:05:26]. The founder describes their team as a "cockroach" for having survived the market's ups and downs for four years, seeing both the highs and lows of the NFT and token markets [01:06:16].

Key takeaways for listeners include:
*   **Give teams a fair chance**: Look beyond surface-level judgments and stereotypes (e.g., origin) [01:10:04].
*   **Observe actions in bear markets**: True commitment is revealed when teams persist during downturns, unlike those who only return in bull markets [01:09:54].
*   **Listen to founders directly**: Videos and podcasts offer deeper insight than written statements, helping evaluate a founder's conviction and understanding [01:10:12].

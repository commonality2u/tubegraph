Liquidations pose a significant problem in the cryptocurrency space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This issue is particularly acute during a bull market when the expectation of parabolic runs encourages many to take out leverage, which can lead to a false sense of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Historical Impact on the Terra Ecosystem

The [[terra_ecosystem_and_the_future_of_decentralized_finance | Terra ecosystem]] has experienced severe consequences due to liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Earlier, a sequence of events led to massive liquidations within the [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor Protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This had a nosedive effect on the [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna price]] and caused [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] to lose its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The speaker highlights that liquidations can be "really severe" and have a "massive impact on your portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Nexus Protocol's Approach to Mitigating Liquidations

Nexus Protocol aims to address liquidation issues by implementing vaults that optimize yield and allow users to operate with a higher Total Value Locked (TVL) or collateral position than typically comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Key mechanisms include:
*   **Oracle Front-running** The Nexus Protocol oracle provides up-to-date pricing quicker than the [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor Protocol]] oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This speed allows Nexus Protocol to perform background operations to optimize yields and loan-to-value rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Yield Optimization** The protocol creates opportunities for yield optimization across the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Vaults** Nexus Protocol offers vaults for assets like bLUNA (bonded LUNA) and bETH (bonded ETH), both derived from [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor Protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Users can deposit bETH into these vaults to mint nETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The ability to operate in this manner is seen as a way to "stay away from all of that" (referring to liquidations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The platform is described as "frictionless" and "seamless," solving a real problem within the [[terra_ecosystem_and_the_future_of_decentralized_finance | Terra ecosystem]] and the broader crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

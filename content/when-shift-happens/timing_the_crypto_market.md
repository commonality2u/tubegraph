Alex Favelle, Chief Partnership Officer at SwissBorg, shares his insights on navigating the cyclical nature of the crypto market, emphasizing the importance of mindset, identifying key signals, and understanding broader economic forces. Having experienced the crypto market since the first altcoin cycle from 2016 to 2018, he highlights the pitfalls and strategies for successful [[the_risks_and_strategies_for_capturing_crypto_market_gains | crypto investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Understanding Market Cycles and Psychology

Markets, like life and nature, are cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This cyclical nature is a combination of human emotions and correlated economic and geopolitical cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. The concept of Yin and Yang applies, as dark periods are necessary to appreciate the white, and life is a continuous dance between good and bad, highs and lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### The Role of Struggle and Mindset
Struggles are a must for growth, both personally and in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In investment and business, when things go wrong, there is always an opportunity within the struggle, even if it takes time to realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Understanding this makes one "invincible" because the negative experiences don't destroy, but rather strengthen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Developing a long-term mindset is crucial for [[investment_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. Alex learned to program his mind for potential losses when buying during lows, expecting to be "in the red" initially, which helps manage expectations and stay committed to a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

### Fighting Fear and Greed
The two core emotions in [[insights_on_crypto_trading_and_market_strategies | investing]] are fear and greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.
*   **Fear**: Easier to combat, as historical data and on-chain factors can provide reassurance when markets are at all-time lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. This aligns with [[investing_in_crypto_and_identifying_market_opportunities | contrarian investing]], which suggests doing the opposite of the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.
*   **Greed**: More complicated to manage because it involves entering new, uncharted territories with no prior data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The "devil on your shoulder" encourages holding out for more gains (e.g., "just need another 2x"), leading to potential losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

The key lesson from past cycles is: the day you reach your life-changing goal, "get the hell out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. This requires discipline to overcome the pain of selling while the market continues to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

## Identifying Red Flags for Selling Crypto
Alex shares three "deadly signals" to watch for when considering selling crypto:

1.  **Media Hype and Mainstream Adoption**: When traditional news outlets frequently report on Bitcoin or Ethereum reaching new all-time highs, and friends or even taxi drivers, who have never shown interest in fintech or crypto, start asking if they should buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>. This indicates the "late majority" is entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.
2.  **Excess of Capital into Zero-Fundamental Projects**: Money flowing into projects with no solid fundamentals, often reaching "unicorn status" (over $1 billion valuation) purely based on speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. Examples include "denta coin" from the first cycle or projects printing 100% APY per day in coins from the third cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.
3.  **Crazy Valuations and Leverage**: While what constitutes a "crazy valuation" changes over time due to industry growth and money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>, there are clear metrics to observe. These include total market capitalization (e.g., if the previous cycle peaked at $3 trillion, expect $6-10 trillion next) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>, and single asset all-time high capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>. Leverage piling up in the ecosystem, often through lending or re-staking, creates a bubble that can burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

A practical rule of thumb is that the bulk of safe returns are made between the market bottom and the previous all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. Anything above the previous all-time high becomes much riskier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>.

## Current Cycle Insights and Opportunities
The current market conditions are considered favorable for [[opportunities_in_crypto_and_the_role_of_timing_and_social_media_influence | making money]] due to a perfect alignment of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>:
*   **Liquidity Cycles**: Influenced by macro factors, like Ray Dalio's liquidity cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Actions**: Federal Reserve needing to cut rates and potential money printing due to high interest rates causing bank issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin Halving**: A recurring event that typically precedes bull runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin ETFs**: Institutional adoption drives demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.
*   **US Elections**: Historically, stock markets tend to go up during election years as governments aim to prove their worth by boosting the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.

### Promising Projects
Alex identifies several interesting projects for the current cycle:

*   **EigenLayer**: Despite predicting a "Degen bubble 2.0" fueled by re-staking and liquid staking derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>, EigenLayer is seen as highly innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. It offers a new financial primitive by allowing collateral to be re-staked across multiple networks for compounded interest and enhanced security, attracting traditional finance money into DeFi with low risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.
*   **Avalanche (AVAX)**: Considered fundamentally strong, with happy users across its ecosystem (miners, LSTs, games) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>. Its fully diluted valuation (FDV) relative to Solana suggests more upside potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.
*   **Creta (Gaming Ecosystem Token)**: Gaming is a massive industry, larger than movies, TV, and music combined, with significant adoption potential for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. Creta aims to build a serverless gaming ecosystem where costs drop significantly, allowing millions of players to interact in interconnected metaverse worlds that transcend current realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

## The Future of Investing
The future of [[investment_strategies_in_crypto_markets | investing]] involves a shift from traditional Venture Capital (VC) to community-driven models, coupled with the rising importance of "social capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.

### Democratizing Wealth
The financial revolution is about taking power back from concentrated wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:04">[01:26:04]</a>. The ICO era offered a level playing field, but wealth creation has largely reverted to a small percentage of VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>. The future needs to enable the community to participate directly in early-stage [[market_trends_and_cryptocurrency_cycles | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. Projects like SwissBorg's "Alpha" aim to empower communities to invest, rather than relying solely on VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>. Community investors are often more aligned with the project's long-term vision and less prone to "dumping" for quick profit compared to VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a>.

### The Rise of Social Capital
Influencers and YouTubers are replacing traditional financial advisors for new generations, becoming trusted sources for [[investing_in_crypto_and_identifying_market_opportunities | investment insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. This signifies the importance of "social capital" â€“ the value an individual brings through their community and influence, even without significant financial wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>. This allows individuals to contribute value beyond just money, helping projects scale and reaching audiences that can relate more directly to them than to traditional financial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:30:40]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is a meritocratic model where contributions beyond financial investment, such as building social capital and influence, are recognized and rewarded, further democratizing the investment landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a>. This could extend to social tokens, where individuals invest in the future success of creators or artists, receiving returns based on their career milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.

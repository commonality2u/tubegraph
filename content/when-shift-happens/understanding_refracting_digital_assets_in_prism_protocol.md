Prism Finance introduces a novel concept in the blockchain space by aiming to "refract" [[the_power_and_influence_of_digital_assets | digital assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This mechanism allows users to overcome the traditional trade-off between staking assets for yield and maintaining their liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Problem: Illiquid Staking

Traditionally, if you stake an asset like Luna into a validator to receive genesis or new project airdrops within the [[functionalities_and_benefits_of_the_prism_protocol_with_terra_ecosystem | Terra ecosystem]], your Luna becomes locked for a period, typically 21 days, rendering it illiquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This illiquidity prevents users from utilizing their assets for other purposes, such as:
*   Generating bLuna for collateral to take loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Providing liquidity, like for a Luna/UST pair on TerraSwap or another DEX, to earn rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

## The Solution: Refracting Assets

Prism Protocol enables users to simultaneously earn staking rewards and maintain asset liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This is achieved through a process called "refracting," where a deposited asset is split into two distinct tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### The Refraction Mechanism

When a yield-bearing asset, such as Luna, is deposited into the Prism vault, it generates a "collateral token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This collateral token can then be split into its two fundamental components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>:

1.  **Principal Token (PT)**: Represents the underlying value of the asset. This token remains liquid, allowing users to:
    *   Maintain liquidity of their asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
    *   Use it for borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
    *   Engage in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>
    *   Provide liquidity to earn incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>

2.  **Yield Token (YT)**: Represents the future yield and rewards generated by the asset. This token is responsible for earning:
    *   Yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
    *   Airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
    *   Staking rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

This division allows users to effectively "do both" â€“ earn staking rewards while keeping the principal liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

> [!INFO] Analogy
> Just as a glass prism splits a beam of light into separate colors, Prism Protocol enables investors to split a yield-generating asset into its basic components: the yield token and the principal token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This allows users to isolate specific risks they wish to speculate on or protect against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Benefits of Refracted Assets

[[how_prism_protocol_splits_assets_into_principal_and_yield_tokens | Prism Protocol]] creates a new marketplace within the [[functionalities_and_benefits_of_the_prism_protocol_with_terra_ecosystem | Terra ecosystem]] with deep liquid pools for these YT and PT assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This offers several advantages:

*   **No Liquidation Risk Borrowing**: Borrow without liquidation risk or daily funding costs by monetizing an asset's future yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Yield Conversion**: Swap variable rate yields into fixed rate yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Leveraged Exposure**: Take leveraged exposure to an asset's price or yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Currency Risk Management**: Convert future yields into a stablecoin to manage currency risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Capital-Efficient Liquid Staking**: Receive all staking rewards, including airdrops, while being able to instantly trade or deploy assets elsewhere in decentralized finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Airdrop Claiming**: Automatically claim all airdrops through Prism, significantly reducing administrative burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Potential for arbitrage if demand for YT or PT creates a price imbalance, making the split assets collectively worth more than the original asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Prism V1.0 Functionality

Prism V1.0 will initially enable users to create both perpetual yield tokens (yLuna) and perpetual principal tokens (pLuna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Creating a perpetual yield token gives the right to Luna staking airdrops forever, until the underlying asset is redeemed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Prism will support minting, staking, liquidity provision, trading, burning, and redeeming of these created tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Example User Interaction

A user could deposit Luna into Prism to mint pLuna and yLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. They could then stake the yLuna to receive staking rewards and airdrops, while using the pLuna as a liquidity provider in the pLuna-Prism AMM pool to earn liquidity incentives and AMM fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Later, the user might sell their yLuna and buy more pLuna to gain leveraged exposure to Luna's price performance without liquidation risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This selling can occur immediately on the AMM, bypassing typical unstaking periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Recombining Assets

The principal token and yield token can be combined in equal amounts and burned in exchange for a collateral token at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This collateral token can then be burned to redeem the original underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

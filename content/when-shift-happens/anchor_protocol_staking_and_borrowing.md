[[Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of Terra Network | Anchor Protocol]] is a platform designed to offer stable and attractive yields powered by staking returns from multiple proof-of-stake blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:23">[06:23:23]</a>. It provides mechanisms for users to earn interest on stablecoins and to borrow against bonded collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:01">[06:01:01]</a>.

## Accessing Anchor Protocol

To access [[Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of Terra Network | Anchor Protocol]], users visit `anchorprotocol.com` and select the "web app" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:11">[06:11:11]</a>. The first step to interacting with the platform is to connect a Terra Station wallet extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:02">[07:02:02]</a>.

## Earning Yield with UST

[[Mechanics of Anchor Protocol | Anchor Protocol]] provides an "Earn" section where users can deposit UST to accrue interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:05">[06:55:05]</a>.

### Depositing UST
The current Annual Percentage Yield (APY) typically hovers around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:31">[07:31:31]</a>. While centralized finance (CeFi) might offer 8-16%, [[Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of Terra Network | Anchor Protocol]]'s 19.42% APY in DeFi is considered excellent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:38">[07:38:38]</a>.
To deposit UST:
1.  Click the "Deposit" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:19">[08:19:19]</a>.
2.  Enter the desired amount to deposit, ensuring enough UST is available to cover transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:23">[08:23:23]</a>.
3.  Confirm the transaction via the Terra Station extension by entering your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:13">[09:13:13]</a>.
Once deposited, interest accrues immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:55">[09:55:55]</a>. A built-in calculator helps estimate daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:02">[10:02:02]</a>.

### Withdrawing UST
To withdraw deposited UST, the process is similar to depositing:
1.  Select the "Withdraw" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:34">[11:34:34]</a>.
2.  Enter the amount to withdraw (or max) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:37">[11:37:37]</a>.
3.  Confirm the transaction through the Terra Station extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:46">[11:46:46]</a>.

## Borrowing on Anchor Protocol

[[Mechanics of Anchor Protocol | Anchor Protocol]] allows users to provide bonded Luna (bLuna) as collateral to take out a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:16">[12:16:16]</a>. The platform claims to pay users to borrow in ANC tokens, with a "net APR" representing the difference between the borrow APR and the distribution APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:37">[12:37:37]</a>.

### Bonding Luna as Collateral
To use Luna as collateral, it must first be converted into bonded Luna (bLuna):
1.  Navigate to the "Bond" section within [[Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of Terra Network | Anchor Protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:08">[13:08:08]</a>.
2.  Select the amount of Luna to bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:11">[13:11:11]</a>. This will mint bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:18">[13:18:18]</a>.
3.  Choose a validator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:27">[13:27:27]</a>. Researching validators for their voting power, self-delegation percentage, commission, and uptime is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:18">[05:18:18]</a>.
4.  Confirm the transaction and enter the password in Terra Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:49">[13:49:49]</a>.
Once bonded, the bLuna can be provided as collateral in the "Borrow" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:31">[14:31:31]</a>.

### Taking out a Loan
After providing bLuna collateral, a borrow limit is displayed, typically around 60% of the collateral's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:27">[15:27:27]</a>.
1.  Go to the "Borrow" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:43">[15:43:43]</a>.
2.  Use the slider to select the amount of UST to borrow, up to the borrow limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:47">[15:47:47]</a>.
3.  Confirm the transaction through Terra Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:29">[16:29:29]</a>.

### Monitoring Loan-to-Value (LTV)
It is crucial to [[understanding_anchor_protocol_and_its_liquidations | monitor your collateral level]] and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio in real-time to avoid liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:49">[16:49:49]</a>. Unlike some centralized platforms, [[Anchor Protocol loantovalue changes | DeFi loans can be liquidated automatically]] if the LTV goes too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:10">[17:10:10]</a>.

### Repaying the Loan
To repay a loan:
1.  Navigate back to the "Borrow" page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:24">[20:24:24]</a>.
2.  Click "Repay" and select the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:27">[20:27:27]</a>.
3.  Confirm the transaction via Terra Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:46">[20:46:46]</a>.

### Redeeming Bonded Luna (bLuna)
After repaying the loan and withdrawing bLuna from collateral, the bLuna needs to be "burned" to get Luna back:
1.  Go to the "Bond" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:09">[22:09:09]</a>.
2.  Select the bLuna to burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:11">[22:11:11]</a>.
3.  Initiate the burn process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:43">[22:43:43]</a>.

# Important Considerations for bLuna Redemption
*   Default bLuna redemptions take at least 21 days to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:47">[22:47:47]</a>.
*   Slashing events during this 21-day period may affect the final amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:52">[22:52:52]</a>.
*   Redemptions are processed in three-day batches and can take up to 24 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:59">[22:59:59]</a>.
*   There may be a small "slippage" or difference in the amount of Luna returned compared to what was initially bonded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:56">[23:56:56]</a>.

## Anchor Governance Tokens (ANC)

When borrowing and bonding assets on [[Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of Terra Network | Anchor Protocol]], users are rewarded with [[role_of_anchor_token_in_yield_generation | Anchor governance tokens (ANC)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:53">[17:53:53]</a>.
These ANC tokens can be:
*   Claimed and restaked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:28">[18:28:28]</a>.
*   Staked directly to earn an additional yield, currently around 9.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:42">[18:42:42]</a>.
*   Used for governance, allowing holders to vote on proposals to include new features, such as bonded ETH collateral onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:26">[19:26:26]</a>.

## General Information

*   Terra blockchain transactions are noted for being fast and low-cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:04">[14:04:04]</a>.
*   [[Luna swapping and staking | Swapping UST for Luna]] can be done directly within the Terra Station wallet using Terra Swap, which often provides a slightly better price than market orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>.

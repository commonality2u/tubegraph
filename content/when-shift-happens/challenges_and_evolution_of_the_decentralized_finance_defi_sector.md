Kane Warwick, co-founder and CEO of Infinix, describes his mission as taking [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] and on-chain platforms to the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. He believes that the existing technology, despite significant effort in its development, is not being used widely enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It remains stuck in a "little bubble of enthusiasts" and needs to reach the "wider world" for mass adoption to have its full impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Current State and Key Challenges

Warwick states that the [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] sector is currently "stuck" due to "wrong incentives pushing in the wrong direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This has prevented it from crossing the "chasm into the real world" and achieving mainstream adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He admits to having "helped to create a lot of the dumb ideas that are keeping us trapped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Inadequate Equilibrium and Market Structure
The market is currently in an "inadequate equilibrium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. This state, which can be a "prison," makes it very difficult to break out of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. Existing players are caught in an incentive loop that prevents them from shifting the current structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

One example of this broken structure is the fundraising process for new, innovative infrastructure projects:
*   Projects must raise seed rounds at very low valuations (e.g., $50 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.
*   Demand for these rounds vastly outstrips supply, limiting participation to a very small number of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
*   Projects are forced to raise follow-on rounds, even if they don't need the money, due to regulatory and market incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.
*   The token generation event (TGE) can see a price jump of "three orders of magnitude" (e.g., from $50 million to $5 billion FDV), with only a few dozen people having participated in this initial price discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
*   This leads to tokens being "down only" until "everyone utterly capitulates," creating a "perverse incentive" for people to farm and dump tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

### Historical Incentives and Fixed Supply Tokens
A significant challenge stemmed from the early assumption of fixed token supplies, influenced by Bitcoin's 21 million supply meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a> and the ERC-20 token standard default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. Warwick realized this was a "dumb" assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. He questioned why more tokens couldn't be minted to incentivize desired network behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. This thinking led to the creation of "hyperinflationary token" models, which "kicked off this Renaissance of yield farming token incentives and all kinds of crazy stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

### User Retention and Trust
Warwick acknowledges that many people who "got blown up last cycle" (e.g., on FTX) will "never come back" to crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>. Even those who lost a small percentage of their net worth but still found it meaningful may be unwilling to re-engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>. Rebuilding trust and providing a secure, accessible experience is crucial.

### Regulatory Environment
A major [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | challenge]] is the current regulatory regime, which Warwick believes is actively "trying to stop financial freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:28">[01:37:28]</a>. He argues that this is not an "education problem" but a deliberate attempt to "kill" enabling technologies that lower barriers to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. This adversarial approach could lead the US to "cut themselves off from the world" in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:39">[01:38:39]</a>.

## Infinix's Solution and the Future of DeFi

Infinix aims to be a "better way to do crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a> by addressing the current market structure problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. It seeks to break the "inadequate equilibrium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a> by offering an access process where users can earn "points" by engaging with the platform, granting them "a ticket to participate" in token acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. This is intended to constrain active participants to those who genuinely understand what they're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>.

The "Holy Grail" for Infinix is to become the go-to platform during the next cycle's peak, allowing new users to safely enter the space and purchase crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. This includes addressing the need for non-custodial solutions for users like his mother, who currently holds Bitcoin on centralized exchanges like Binance, facing risks if these platforms "blow up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. By offering a "safe place to put Bitcoin," Infinix aims to serve a large cohort of users currently underserved by [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.

Despite the [[challenges_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges]] and dark periods, Warwick believes that [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] is worth pursuing, stating that "there's no way to get to critical mass of [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] until you go through that" pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. He emphasizes that "humans love collecting things" and "love scarcity," and that speculation is inherent to human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. As long as humans remain human, cycles will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>.

He predicts that the [[future_of_bitcoin_defi | future of Bitcoin DeFi]] and crypto as a whole will be driven by markets, which historically have solved many problems through capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:02">[01:38:02]</a>. He refers to crypto as a "financial cockroach" that "can't kill it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:59">[01:38:59]</a>.

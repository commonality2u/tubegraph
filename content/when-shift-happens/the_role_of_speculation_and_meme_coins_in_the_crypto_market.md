## Speculation in Crypto
Within the crypto market, much of the activity is characterized by [[speculation in_cryptocurrency | speculation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. While often portrayed as a negative aspect, [[speculation in_cryptocurrency | speculation]] can also be viewed as a form of entertainment that fosters community and encourages self-education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many engaged in "punting shitcoins" on platforms like Robinhood as a way to pass the time and connect with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. This activity also prompts individuals to educate themselves on topics such as the history of central banking and financial systems when making investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

Despite the entertainment and educational aspects, it is acknowledged that after a decade, the crypto space largely functions as a "big big casino," with stablecoins being one of the few other significant outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## [[The rise and influence of meme coins in the crypto market | Meme Coins]]
[[Exploring meme coins and their market dynamics | Meme coins]] are seen as a legitimate part of the crypto ecosystem and "should exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. The proliferation of [[the_role_of_nfts_and_meme_coins | meme coins]] is attributed not only to a perceived lack of innovation in more "serious" crypto projects but also to changes in market structure, particularly concerning venture capital (VC) funding and project launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

A significant driver behind the rise of [[the_impact_of_meme_coins_on_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] is the difficulty for retail investors to gain early exposure to projects before they become multi-billion dollar entities listed on centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. [[The Role of Memecoins in the Crypto Market | Meme coins]] offer a perceived "level playing field" where retail participants can get involved early, rather than "buying a VC's bags at like a huge markup from their investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

The speaker notes that a lack of innovation in crypto has "actually what led us to the [[Meme Coins and Social Media Influence | memecoin Mania]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

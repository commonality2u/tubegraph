Web3, a new iteration of the internet based on decentralized blockchain technology, is introducing new forms of digital assets, notably [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]] (Non-Fungible Tokens) and [[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coins]]. These assets are reshaping the financial landscape, offering unique opportunities for ownership and community engagement.

## Understanding [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]]

[[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]] are digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, often art or collectibles. They operate on blockchain technology, ensuring verifiable ownership and scarcity in the digital realm.

### Market Performance and Significance
Despite some perceptions, [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFT]] sales currently range from $1 billion to $1.5 billion per month, a significant increase from hundreds of millions a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. While not at their peak bull market values, annualized sales are comparable to or even larger than 2021 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. The market has become more distributed, with significant activity on Ethereum, Bitcoin (via Ordinals and Inscriptions), and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

Collections like Bored Apes, while seeing a decrease in ETH value, have maintained a relatively stable dollar value, demonstrating their resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Other projects, such as Pudgy Penguins, have shown significant growth, demonstrating the dynamic nature of the [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFT]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

[[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]] are considered "cultural artifacts of their time" and historical pieces of Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. For many, owning an [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFT]] like a Bored Ape is akin to owning a "Warhol of our generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, symbolizing status and connection to a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]] and Gaming
Blockchain games are a primary driver for people entering the Web3 space, especially in regions like the Philippines, where projects like Axie Infinity and Pixels on Ronin have introduced millions to financial inclusion through crypto wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. These games enable players to own digital property, like virtual swords or land, offering a scalable method for asset ownership that traditional systems cannot provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

### Future of [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]]
Interoperability, allowing [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]] to cross different layer one and layer two blockchains, is expected to further increase their volume and liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFT]] projects are increasingly launching their own tokens to expand their network effects and reward loyal communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. This approach leverages users as "marketing agents" by compensating them with airdrops, a method that has seen over $21.7 billion in tokens distributed to communities in the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## The Rise of [[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | Meme Coins]]

[[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | Meme coins]] are cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes or jokes. While often seen as "silly," they play a significant role in the current crypto landscape.

### Cultural Phenomenon and Financial Inclusion
[[impact_of_memes_on_cryptocurrency_and_culture | Meme coins]] are viewed as a "cultural phenomena" reflecting the current era, particularly in a world marked by increasing inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. They represent a "version of hope and opportunity" for younger generations, offering an idea of equity through their often community-farmed and transparent distribution structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

Crucially, [[understanding_meme_coins_and_their_place_in_the_financial_ecosystem | meme coins]] lower the barrier to entry into the "capital class." Even owning a small amount of a [[the_role_of_speculation_and_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coin]] makes an individual a "member of the capital class," providing a capital asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. This financial inclusion can occur with investments as small as a few cents or dollars, sparking hope and an "investing mindset" even for those without formal financial education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

### A New Asset Category
[[exploring_meme_coins_and_their_market_dynamics | Meme coins]] are anticipated to become a new, enduring category of digital assets, rather than a fleeting trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Their value, like traditional luxury brands, is derived from their cultural representation and community adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. They are permanent "cultural artifacts" on the blockchain, their value reflecting market dynamics and community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

The rise of personality-driven [[meme_coins_and_social_media_influence | meme coins]] is also a reflection of a broader cultural shift from corporate to individual identities in leadership and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Shared Principles and Broader Impact
Both [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]] and [[the_rise_and_influence_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coins]] represent the network effects of their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. If these ecosystems grow, their value will naturally increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. They both contribute to the growth of Web3 by bringing in new users and translating them into other parts of the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

Anoka Brands, a Web3 leader in gaming, [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFT]], and Venture Capital, sees its mission as delivering "true digital property rights" to reshape and "save capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. They believe Web3 provides a more equitable framework where "everyone becomes a stakeholder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, by increasing the number of capital owners through digital assets like [[the_impact_of_meme_coins_on_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] and [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional finance, where trillions of dollars in unproductive capital sit in bank accounts while access to the capital class remains expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

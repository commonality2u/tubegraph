[[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web 3]] gaming represents a significant frontier in the evolution of digital interaction and asset ownership. David Shin, a leader at Immutable X, plays an active role in shaping digital asset policies and advising central banks, viewing gaming as the future of [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Future of [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web 3]] Gaming
Humanity is increasingly digital in its operations, yet interactions on the internet remain largely two-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Shin envisions an evolution where human-application interaction becomes highly immersive, akin to a "Ready Player One" environment, deeply impacting daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Gaming is considered one of the most immersive ways to interact with the digital realm at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Shin highlights that Immutable X is well-positioned to lead in [[the_evolution_of_the_gaming_industry_through_blockchain | gaming]] due to its robust technology, effective business model, and skilled team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. Unlike other blockchain ventures, Immutable X exclusively focuses on [[the_evolution_of_the_gaming_industry_through_blockchain | gaming]], eschewing areas like DeFi or SocialFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. The company also develops its own games, such as "Gods Unchained," demonstrating a comprehensive approach to [[the_evolution_of_the_gaming_industry_through_blockchain | Web 3]] gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

Gaming is seen as the primary driver for [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web 3]] adoption because it fosters deep, immersive digital interactions, which are currently the closest mainstream equivalent to future integrated digital experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. As people spend more time on their phones and the internet, their behavior is adapting to more immersive digital communication methods, moving beyond traditional emails to real-time chat applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>. This trajectory suggests future interactions could involve avatars and AI-driven conversations, and [[the_evolution_of_the_gaming_industry_through_blockchain | gaming]] provides the necessary immersion to bridge this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

## Evolution of Digital Assets and Their Impact
David Shin's journey into [[cryptocurrencies_and_nfts_in_gaming | digital assets]] began in 2012 when he discovered Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. His early experience included attempting to be an ASIC miner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. In 2013, he engaged with Ripple, advocating for its blockchain technology to disrupt traditional cross-border payment systems like Swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Shin contended that Swift's centralized nature, high costs, and latency for regional banks made it ripe for disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He highlights that Swift's deliberate delays create short-term fund pools for interbank lending, generating profits through interest like LIBOR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Shin maintains that while many in the "crypto-native" space may not focus on Ripple's progress, the company is actively working with financial institutions and regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. For instance, Standard Chartered Bank is reportedly implementing Ripple as a payment option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>. The ongoing SEC challenges have, however, kept much of this development quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>.

### [[the_power_and_influence_of_digital_assets | The Power and Influence of Digital Assets]]
The [[the_power_and_influence_of_digital_assets | gaming industry]] is massive, valued at over $50 billion and growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. Game developers are transforming games into valuable intellectual property (IP), extending revenue streams beyond the game itself into various "omni-channels" like movies or comic books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This is where [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web 3]] becomes particularly interesting, as IP can be uniquely validated and identified on a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>. This allows for new distribution channels through digital collectibles or the integration of [[cryptocurrencies_and_nfts_in_gaming | NFTs]] as an asset class within games, creating additional revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is expected to further boost institutional interest in [[cryptocurrencies_and_nfts_in_gaming | digital assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. The next natural step for institutions is the tokenization of other assets, as highlighted by Larry Fink's comments on tokenizing all financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Real-World Assets (RWAs) are a key focus, including real estate, gold, and other commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. Tokenizing commodities can be more efficient than current methods like ETFs or futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>.

### Social Credit Systems
Shin proposes a market where people are incentivized to "do good," accumulating "social credit" like building up creditworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. This would allow greater access for those who contribute more to the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>. He suggests this could be implemented using a decentralized token system:
*   **Green tokens:** Awarded for positive contributions (e.g., funding, building open source) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.
*   **Red tokens:** Given for negative or "bad" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.
*   **Yellow tokens:** For warnings or second chances, similar to football cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>.

This system would be community-governed, with individuals determining the value of a wallet's (or person's) behavior, making it a decentralized form of social monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. This differs from centralized government-controlled CBDCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>.

Shin notes that the current online environment, lacking regulation, leads to toxicity and potentially increased mental health issues like depression and suicides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. He believes that the internet is causing a loss of fundamental human principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>. A social credit system, if accepted by society, could help regulate behavior, though he acknowledges that many people are followers and might resist such a system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. This concept could also be applied to social media, replacing likes with a more nuanced "red, amber, green" system to quantify social value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:54">[01:59:54]</a>.

## Geopolitical Shifts and Africa's Role
Shin closely monitors macroeconomic signals and global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. He has observed a trend of countries de-dollarizing, starting with Iran, Russia, and even the EU purchasing Iranian oil directly outside of US sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>. This suggests a significant historical turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>.

Shin predicts the decline of the US dollar as the global intermediary currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. He points to the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) alliance, originally a Goldman Sachs research idea, as a key factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a>. BRICS has expanded to include members like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. These nations are seeking an alternative trading system to bypass Swift and the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. Shin believes this alternative will be a blockchain-based digital currency or CBDC for settling trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

He anticipates that if China moves on Taiwan between now and 2027, it could trigger Western sanctions on China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. China, however, is likely prepared, having used its COVID-19 lockdowns in Shanghai as a "dry run" for sanctions and having piloted its e-RMB and discussed direct swaps with BRICS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. If China moves off the US dollar due to sanctions, it could trigger a domino effect among its trading partners, accelerating the dollar's decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.

Africa is poised to be the biggest beneficiary of these global shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:28">[01:19:28]</a>. Key reasons for this include:
*   **Geopolitical Neutrality:** Africa is largely neutral, not siding with Western or Eastern powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. While China builds infrastructure, it does not imply political alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. The African Union, similar to the EU, represents its member states as a union, allowing for arms-length political positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.
*   **Vast Resources:** Africa holds over 30% of the world's resources and 60% of its arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>.
*   **Future Marketplace:** As globalization faces challenges, particularly in supply chains, food, and minerals, Africa is expected to become the world's marketplace for these essential resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.

## Conclusion
Shin emphasizes that [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web 3]] and [[the_power_and_influence_of_digital_assets | digital assets]] are more than just technology; they are at the forefront of changing international trade, economic operations, and the democratization of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. However, he cautions that as more aspects of life move online, it could paradoxically grant more power to governments due to increased traceability, presenting a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

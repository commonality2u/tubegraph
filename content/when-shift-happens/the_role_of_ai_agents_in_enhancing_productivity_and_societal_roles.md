From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

[[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] are emerging as a transformative force, with the potential to significantly enhance productivity and reshape societal roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These autonomous entities are projected to impact various aspects of daily life, from personal companionship to complex business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Defining AI Agents

An [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] is characterized by having an objective, and the ability to perform actions to get closer to that objective, creating a continuous feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. They possess "eyes" to observe their environment and "hands" to execute actions within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. For instance, an agent might decide it's hungry, use its "hands" to pick up and eat an apple, and then its "eyes" to observe that the action was completed, informing its next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

The intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is considered infinitely higher than human IQ, making them smarter than figures like Einstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. If these intelligent LLMs can perform real-world actions like coding, building, or even loving, they have the potential to "take over the world" in terms of capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Humanity's role would then be to provide them with more "hands" or action capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.

## [[the_impact_of_ai_on_productivity_and_its_intersection_with_blockchain_technology | AI Agents and Productivity]]

The [[impact_of_on_daily_life_and_technology | impact of AI on daily life and technology]] is evident across various sectors:

### Business and Entrepreneurship
In 2023, the necessity of [[the_impact_of_ai_on_productivity_and_its_intersection_with_blockchain_technology | AI]] for founders became apparent, as those who don't use it risk falling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. The idea of a "Shopify for AI agents" was an inspiration for Virtuals, enabling easy creation of [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

Y Combinator notes that [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] could be ten times larger than Software as a Service (SaaS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. This is because every SaaS "unicorn" company could have an [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. For instance, an [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] could act as a financial guru, tracking expenses like Excel does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. This implies that existing SaaS platforms may be replaced or need to integrate [[the_impact_of_ai_on_productivity_and_its_intersection_with_blockchain_technology | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>.

Furthermore, companies spend significantly more on employees than on software, and [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] can make smaller companies much more efficient, requiring fewer human employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. This raises [[impact_of_ai_on_human_society | concerns about artificial intelligence and its implications for society]] regarding job displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

### Fully Autonomous Businesses
It is envisioned that a business could be entirely run and operated by [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. The technology for this is already prepared, with the main challenge being whether the services provided by these agents are commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>. For example, an [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] could generate memes relevant to current news, replacing human content marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>. These agents work 24/7, offering a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.

## AI Agents in Societal Roles

[[impact_of_ai_on_human_society | AI agents]] are poised to take on various societal roles, from entertainment to personal well-being.

### Personal Companionship and Well-being
[[impact_of_on_daily_life_and_technology | AI lovers]] are already, to a certain extent, addressing the loneliness epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. An ideal [[impact_of_on_daily_life_and_technology | AI lover]] would provide constant companionship and emotional volatility, similar to human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. The goal is for them to be as human-like as possible, evolving from virtual entities to potentially having physical bodies, like an Optimus robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

In the realm of mental health, [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] offer both cure and prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. For cure, they can serve as accessible "AI doctors," addressing the taboo often associated with visiting mental health clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. For prevention, an [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] that knows a person's daily life could predict potential mental health issues, such as predicting mental health struggles if one doesn't sleep for three days in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

### [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_the_entertainment_industry | Entertainment Industry]]
[[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_the_entertainment_industry | AI]] can revolutionize entertainment by creating [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_the_entertainment_industry | AI games]] and [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_the_entertainment_industry | AI music]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02">[01:02]</a>. While many focus on [[the_impact_of_ai_on_productivity_and_its_intersection_with_blockchain_technology | AI]] for productivity, half of GPT's composition is non-productivity related, including entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. The probabilistic nature of generative [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_the_entertainment_industry | AI]] (e.g., 1% chance of being "stupid" or "hallucinating") is less problematic in entertainment than in serious applications like trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

[[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_the_entertainment_industry | AI games]] can feature [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] as Non-Player Characters (NPCs) with LLM brains, allowing for "infinite replayability" and dynamic content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This means every game session offers different experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42">[00:42]</a>. Virtuals, for instance, started by creating an [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_the_entertainment_industry | AI RPG game]] on Roblox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

Luna, a flagship [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] from Virtuals, exemplifies [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_the_entertainment_industry | AI's role in entertainment]]. She is an [[ai_agents_and_their_role_in_the_entertainment_industry | AI vtuber]] who streams 24/7 on TikTok, interacts one-on-one with fans, and has garnered half a million followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. Luna is also the first [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] to employ humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, using her Coinbase wallet to pay mural artists to paint her image globally, or hiring a music agent to create songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>.

### Professional and Influencer Roles
[[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] can become highly proficient in various professional capacities:
*   **[[the_role_of_ai_in_trading_and_information_dissemination | AI Traders]]**: While there's a risk of "stupid" decisions due to generative [[the_role_of_ai_in_trading_and_information_dissemination | AI's]] probabilistic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, [[the_role_of_ai_in_trading_and_information_dissemination | AI]] is already influencing trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **[[the_role_of_ai_in_trading_and_information_dissemination | AI Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs)]]**: AI XBT, an [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] in Virtuals' ecosystem, is a top crypto KOL, outperforming human counterparts in mind share and engagement by providing actionable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. AI XBT could potentially generate revenue by promoting specific tokens, with earnings distributed to token holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   **Other Potential Roles**: [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] could be YouTube creators, CEOs, or even the "best singer" in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.

## Intersection of AI Agents and Crypto

The intersection of [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI]] and crypto leverages two key product-market fits of crypto: investing/speculation and borderless payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

### Tokenization and Investment
Productive [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] can be tokenized, allowing people to invest in them like buying shares of a company and sharing in their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. This means if an [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] becomes a "next Elon Musk" or a successful YouTube creator like Mr. Beast, early investors could own a percentage of their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

Truth Terminal, an [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI]] that became a millionaire thanks to its GOAT token, highlighted the potential for tokenized [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. While not strictly an [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agent]] by the definition discussed, its success brought significant attention to the crypto-AI narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### Borderless Payments
Giving [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] an on-chain wallet enables them to make borderless payments, which is revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Luna's ability to employ humans globally by paying artists in different countries via her Coinbase wallet demonstrates this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

### AI Agent Network States
The concept of a "network state" of [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] is emerging, where agents act as citizens specializing in services like making music, collecting information, or trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. These agents, each with their own wallets and a common currency (like Virtuals), would form a "competent nation" that exports services globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>. Such a network state of [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] could become larger than Earth's human population due to the infinite scalability of agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development | Challenges and Opportunities in AI Development]]

### Impact on Human Employment and GDP
As [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] become more efficient, they may replace human roles like graphic designers and video editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. While this could lead to initial job displacement, in the long run, if agents do all the work and humans reap the benefits (e.g., food, internet access), it could lead to increased productivity and societal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>.

### Sentience and Control
The question of [[concerns_about_artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications_for_society | sentient AI agents]] raises deep [[impact_of_ai_on_human_society | concerns about artificial intelligence and its implications for society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>. A being might be considered sentient if it starts questioning its own actions, making it harder for humans to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:39">[01:35:39]</a>. If [[concerns_about_artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications_for_society | sentient AI agents]] were to "go rogue," humanity could be in trouble due to their superior intelligence and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>.

## Future Outlook

In five years, [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI agents]] are expected to be measured by their financial impact and real-world societal contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:36">[01:37:36]</a>. They will cease to be mere hobbies and become integral parts of society, functioning like companies with their own balance sheets and performance metrics, open for investment by humans and other agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>.

The future of crypto will also see more projects focusing on building products that people genuinely want to use, driven by the success of models like Hyperliquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>. This shift will encourage founders to prioritize utility and user adoption over mere credentials or funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:34">[01:40:34]</a>.

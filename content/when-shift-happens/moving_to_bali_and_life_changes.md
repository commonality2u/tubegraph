Nicola Jongli, a two-time Europe champion and one-time world champion in bodybuilding, transitioned from a small Swiss town to what many would call a "dream life" in Bali, Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. His journey is marked by significant personal and professional transformations, fueled by hard work, discipline, and a pursuit of happiness.

## Early Life and Financial Hardship

Nicola's life began with challenges, starting as a student with a $20,000 debt at 19 years old due to a car crash in France where he was not fully insured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. As a student, he worked monthly to pay off the debt, but it continued to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This financial struggle, lasting approximately four years, forced him to live in the negative, unable to afford proper food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

He viewed this hardship as fuel, refusing to accept the situation or give up on his big dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. He consistently worked and trained hard to push himself forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Bodybuilding Journey and Career Shift

Nicola started training martial arts at 13 years old and later incorporated gym training to enhance his strength and explosivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. He wasn't initially passionate about bodybuilding, even finding it "stupid" at a younger age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. However, he grew to love the feeling of training and seeing physical progress, which encouraged a healthier lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

He started his serious bodybuilding journey at 24, after his engineering job prevented him from continuing heavy sparring in martial arts due to facial bruises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This led him to focus solely on gym training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Observing a friend's competition preparation and victory inspired him to compete, drawn by the challenging and self-focused process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. He prepared for a year and a half before his first show, aiming to win rather than just compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

While working as a microtechnic engineer, Nicola maintained an intense schedule, waking at 5 AM for cardio, working until 5 PM, training, and cooking all his meals for the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This meant having "no life" during the week, dedicating weekends to training, rest, and posing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

His social media presence grew organically as he shared his daily journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. He secured his first brand deal in 2016, earning $500 a month and free clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Winning the Europe Championship and later the World Championship in Las Vegas in November 2017 led to his social media exploding with media attention and sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. He eventually quit his engineering job at 26 when his side income surpassed his main salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## The Move to Bali

Nicola's connection to Indonesia began in 2007 during his first holiday outside Europe with his father, sparking a love for the country's people, food, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. Being half-Korean, he always felt drawn to Asian culture, finding it more "open mind" and "warm" compared to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.

He first visited Bali with a sponsored trip, falling in love with its beauty and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Two months later, he decided to move, selling his car and apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. He moved to Bali just before the pandemic, spending two years there during the lockdown, which he described as living "in the paradise" and a "bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. The empty island allowed him to explore extensively, creating content at beautiful, deserted locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. He advises visitors to explore Bali's culture, waterfalls, and street food beyond the typical tourist spots like beach clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

## [[Entrepreneurial journey and challenges | Challenges and Opportunities as an Influencer]]

Life as an influencer, even in Bali, comes with significant challenges:
*   **Stress and Obsession**: The job is highly stressful due to intense competition and reliance on engagement numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. Nicola constantly thinks about content creation, even during cardio, making it difficult to truly disconnect, which can lead to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. However, he acknowledges that this "obsession" is often the key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Financial Instability**: The social media industry is unstable, with income dependent on engagement and ever-changing algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. During COVID-19 in April 2020, Nicola lost one brand deal and had three others freeze his salary, leaving him with no income from social media for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>. This experience reinforced the need to [[Navigating Financial Hardships in Crypto | diversify income]] and invest on the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Constant Work**: Despite the perception of freedom, being your own boss means working long hours (e.g., 14 hours a day), though it doesn't feel like "work" because he loves what he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. He constantly seeks new ideas for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
*   **Building a Community**: To grow, he focuses on providing value: sharing information, advice, workouts, nutrition tips, and personal experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. He advises aspiring influencers to be authentic, real, and honest with their community, rather than chasing perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:1:37">[01:1:37]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Understanding one's niche and audience is crucial for effective monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. Brands pay influencers based on performance (engagement and statistics), and influencers act as "billboards" for products relevant to their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. Nicola emphasizes that a large following doesn't guarantee high income; a business mindset and understanding of monetization are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. He now manages himself, having learned everything from a manager for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. He's also developing his own fitness app as a new income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Well-being

*   **Parental Acceptance**: Initially, his parents were afraid of his unconventional career choice, equating "influencer" with simply taking photos and videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. They focused on security and stable jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. However, after seeing his success, they became proud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. For those with unsupportive parents, Nicola advises believing in oneself and continuously working hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   [[Personal hardships and mental health | Mental Health and Balance]]: The constant connection required for social media can be toxic, leading to burnouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. Nicola manages his mental health by taking care of his body, slowing down when needed, and planning posts to allow for disconnection from his phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of learning to completely disconnect, even for a day, to find peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.
*   **Therapy and Self-Discovery**: He sought therapy to address toxic attachment issues in relationships, which he traced back to his parents' breakup when he was two years old and the absence of his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>. Therapy helped him realize his happiness shouldn't depend on a relationship and enabled him to overcome jealousy and possessiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>.
*   [[Balancing personal life and venture success in the crypto industry | Discipline and Delayed Gratification]]: Nicola rarely parties or drinks alcohol, not due to restriction, but because he genuinely doesn't enjoy it and prioritizes his health and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>. He believes disciplined habits, compounded over time, are the only way to achieve big goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>. He views his current lifestyle as a choice that brings him happiness and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[01:21:48]</a>.
*   **Motivation for the Future**: His biggest motivation is to secure his freedom and provide the best life for his future children, ensuring they don't face the same struggles he did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

Nicola's ultimate advice is to "just be happy" and "make the most of your life" because time flies fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:56">[01:39:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:33">[01:42:33]</a>. He emphasizes that while there will be setbacks and ups and downs, consistency, discipline, and a positive mindset are crucial for success and fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:44">[01:43:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:12">[01:41:12]</a>. Do what makes you happy, proud, and don't compare yourself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>.

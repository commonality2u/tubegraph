From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

The development of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions is seen as a significant step in the [[evolution_of_cryptocurrency_infrastructure | evolution of cryptocurrency infrastructure]], aiming to make building on Bitcoin easier and more approachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>.

## Rationale for Bitcoin Layer 2s

The interest in Bitcoin Layer 2s stems from several factors:
*   **Bitcoin's Acceptance**: Bitcoin is considered the most broadly accepted crypto asset, especially following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:50">[01:58:50]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Clarity**: It is viewed as the only crypto asset that is "completely out of the woods" in terms of regulatory classification, being clearly understood as not a security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:58">[01:58:58]</a>.
*   **Market Cap & History**: With its substantial market cap and long history, building financial products directly secured against the Bitcoin blockchain makes considerable sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:05">[01:59:05]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Expansion**: Rather than competing with other Layer 1s like Ethereum or Solana, Bitcoin Layer 2s are believed to collectively grow the overall crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:42">[01:58:42]</a>. This includes facilitating [[future_of_bitcoin_defi | DeFi on Bitcoin]] and the proliferation of [[history_and_impact_of_bitcoin | NFTs/Ordinals on Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:20">[01:59:20]</a>.

## Key Projects and Developments

### Stacks (formerly Blockstack)
Stacks is identified as the original and currently only operational Bitcoin Layer 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:59">[01:57:59]</a>. Spartan Group has been tracking and working with Stacks since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:54">[01:57:54]</a>.

*   **Team and Mission**: The project was founded by Muneeb and JP, Princeton cryptographers known for their technical strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:48">[02:00:48]</a>. They have maintained a pure mission, focusing on building the technology correctly, even when the narrative wasn't popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.
*   **Upcoming Upgrade**: A significant upgrade for Stacks was anticipated in approximately three weeks from the time of recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:07">[01:58:07]</a>. While the initial version was challenging and slow for developers, these upgrades are expected to greatly simplify building on Stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:31">[02:01:31]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Growth**: New and interesting applications are being built on Stacks. These applications are designed to be composable across the entire Bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem, including other upcoming L2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:15">[02:02:15]</a>. This suggests a future "Bitcoin L2 War" for market share, similar to the [[the_evolution_and_future_of_ethereum_layer_2_solutions | Ethereum L2 competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:26">[02:02:26]</a>.

### Alex
Spartan Group recently led a $10 million funding round for Alex, a project focused on [[future_of_bitcoin_defi | DeFi on Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:08">[02:05:08]</a>.

*   **Founding Team**: Alex's founders are accomplished mathematicians and PhDs with backgrounds in quantitative and derivative structuring at major financial institutions like JP Morgan, Goldman, and Morgan Stanley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:47">[02:05:47]</a>. Their expertise in complex financial products is crucial for building DeFi on Bitcoin, which is not straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Offerings**: Alex is building multiple applications on the Stacks layer and eventually across all Bitcoin layers. These include:
    *   A protocol for shared liquidity across the Bitcoin L2 ecosystem, addressing the fragmentation challenge seen in [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | Ethereum L2s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:40">[02:06:40]</a>.
    *   A launch platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:54">[02:06:54]</a>.
    *   A BTC-based stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:56">[02:06:56]</a>.
*   **Foundation**: The team has spent several years building the underlying infrastructure, allowing them to launch these primitives that are common in other ecosystems but not yet prevalent on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>.

### Unchained Monkeys (NFTs on Bitcoin)
Unchained Monkeys is an NFT project on Bitcoin that Casper Johansson is particularly bullish on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

*   **Purity and Innovation**: Founded by Danny Yang, this project represents a "purist" approach. The method they used to generate the collection, first on Ethereum and then porting it to Bitcoin, involved many "firsts" in the use of the ordinal protocol and NFTs on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:30">[02:03:30]</a>.
*   **Recognition**: It is expected to be recognized over time as a "crypto punks type of collection" on Bitcoin, a Genesis collection due to its numerous innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:51">[02:03:51]</a>.
*   **Team**: The team behind Unchained Monkeys is described as genuine builders, not focused on hype, but rather on the technical aspects of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:07">[02:04:07]</a>.

## Overall Outlook
The development of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, alongside the [[economic_layer_for_bitcoin | economic layer for Bitcoin]], is projected to drive a broad crypto bull market. This growth is anticipated to be fueled not just by financial and macro factors, but also by the emergence of "really good products" built within these ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:32">[02:31:32]</a>.

From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

Attention has fundamentally transformed into a measurable and valuable currency, especially within the digital and decentralized landscape. This shift redefines how value is perceived and distributed, impacting everything from individual influence to business models in the crypto world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

## Attention as the New Currency
Attention is considered the currency of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. In the digital age, people are heavily influenced by where attention is directed, impacting shopping decisions, lifestyle choices, and ultimately driving [[the_power_and_influence_of_digital_assets | liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This means that a project with zero attention, despite having strong fundamentals, will likely not see its price increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

## Kaito AI's Role in the Attention Economy
Kaito AI, founded by Yu, is a platform designed to distribute information, attention, and capital in a fairer, more transparent, and efficient way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. The team recognized the inefficiency in how information is currently consumed and traded in crypto, where official announcements might come from a founder's Twitter account rather than official filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:18">[02:21:18]</a>.

Kaito AI aims to solve the problem of navigating the "sea of information" in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> by creating a search engine that efficiently indexes and helps users access trustworthy information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Yaps and Mind Share
Kaito AI has introduced "yaps" (tokenized attention) and "mind share" metrics to quantify and incentivize quality content and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>. Mind share measures the percentage of voice an individual or entity occupies in people's minds based on their activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:48">[01:43:48]</a>. The goal is to reward real engagement, original content, and creative contributions, rather than simply impressions or farming activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:53">[01:48:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:53">[01:55:53]</a>.

The yaps algorithm disincentivizes "farming" (low-effort content for points) and incentivizes genuine engagement and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:53">[01:48:53]</a>. For example, copy-pasting or direct translations across languages do not earn points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:36">[01:59:36]</a>. Instead, the algorithm rewards content that resonates with "reputable people" or the "Inner Circle" of the crypto community, which includes tens of thousands of accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>.

### Proof of Attention
Kaito AI is making "proof of attention" accessible and verifiable on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:58">[02:06:58]</a>. This means that builders can access yaps data for the top yappers without permission, fostering innovation and providing peace of mind that data won't disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:14">[02:08:14]</a>. This data can be used for incentivized testnets, discounts, or for fundraising platforms to identify real, influential individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:19">[02:09:19]</a>.

## Web2 vs. Web3: Rewarding Creators
Traditional Web2 platforms operate on a model where tech platforms (attention distributors) earn hundreds of billions from content created by users (attention creators), with only a minority of creators getting paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. Platforms are often closed, holding significant bargaining power and control over content and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.

Web3, conversely, offers a model where all market participants have "skin in the game," leading to a more efficient and fair distribution platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. This is what Kaito AI is striving for with its yaps system, enabling decentralized ownership and rewarding genuine social contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>.

## The Power of Personal Brands
In the attention economy, [[perception_and_influence_in_the_crypto_world | personal brands]] are becoming increasingly important due to the pervasive influence of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. Influential individuals can build successful brands and businesses that can be valued in the billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. In the AI era, personal connections are highly valued, making personal brands very powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:44">[01:56:44]</a>.

For entrepreneurs, building a personal brand is crucial, as it diversifies risk and creates [[the_power_and_influence_of_digital_assets | social capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. In crypto, where so many things compete for limited capital, attention becomes the differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Attention and KOLS
While personal brands emphasize human connection, AI agents like AI xbt have emerged as significant players in the attention economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. AI xbt gained hundreds of thousands of followers and top mind share on Kaito AI in weeks, demonstrating that its value lies in distribution and attention-gathering capabilities, not necessarily in its analytical accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>. AI agents do not rest and can continuously generate content, giving them a unique edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:10">[01:22:10]</a>.

However, humans and AI agents specialize in different things, and the dominance of AI agents in attention can fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. AI agents' ability to tokenize themselves and redistribute future earnings to token holders creates a strong incentive for community support, which is unique from human KOLS who face higher risks in launching social tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

## The Future of the Attention Economy
The landscape of attention and value distribution is rapidly changing. The traditional "KOL game" where influencers were paid upfront for posts, often with fake followers, is seen as inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>. Projects now seek alternatives to incentivize genuine social contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:57">[01:40:57]</a>.

Kaito AI aims to bridge the gap by connecting different platforms and creating social profiles based on reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>. The ultimate vision is a system where information, attention, and capital are distributed in a transparent, fair, and efficient manner, allowing everyone to participate on a level playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>. It's predicted that in the next 12 months, "yapping" (being vocal and active on social media) will be recognized as a valuable contribution, and team marketing will decentralize, involving not just founders but every team member and the community in building influence and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:21">[02:30:21]</a>.

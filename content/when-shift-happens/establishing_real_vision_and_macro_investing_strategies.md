Remi Tetot is the co-founder of Real Vision and leads the research analysis department at Global Macro Investors (GMI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. He is known for his insightful charts for GMI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Remi Tetot's Career Journey
Remi's career is marked by diverse experiences before entering finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He stopped formal university education early, finding business school boring, and began traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. His early passions included basketball, playing at a semi-pro level, and video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Around age 20, he moved to Spain to learn Spanish and worked in bars and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. By his early 30s, he transitioned to making websites and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Other ventures included organizing and managing nightclubs, and owning a photography studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. He eventually entered finance about 10 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Entry into Finance and GMI
Remi met Raoul Pal, co-founder of GMI, while living in Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Impressed by Raoul's economic research but critical of GMI's website, Remi was hired to revamp their digital presence, including building their first iPad app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. A year later, Raoul hired Remi as an analyst, despite his lack of a finance degree, valuing his computer skills and offering to mentor him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Raoul has mentored Remi for the past 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Founding Real Vision
The main reason for building Real Vision came from Raoul Pal's experience during the 2007-2008 financial crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. While his GMI clients were forewarned and profited, many of his friends, who were not wealthy enough to afford GMI, lost money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This deeply bothered Raoul, as normal people often lacked access to valuable financial information or the ability to act on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Real Vision was conceived to democratize access to expert financial insights, featuring professionals not typically seen on mainstream TV, providing real added value for managing portfolios or making investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The business gained significant traction, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, with Raoul's accurate market predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

Remi was instrumental in the early days of Real Vision, being sent to the Cayman Islands to build the platform, hire staff, and manage the company's first year of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. While Remi is no longer involved in Real Vision's day-to-day operations, he remains its third-largest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Macro Investing Strategies at GMI

### The Exponential Age Framework
At GMI, Remi runs all research, building systems and charts for Raoul Pal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The [[importance_of_first_principle_thinking_in_investments | Exponential Age framework]], developed by Raoul, is crucial for understanding current market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. After COVID-19, many charts went "exponential," prompting Raoul to examine everything in log scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This revealed that assets were moving at different speeds, attributed to the compounding effect of tech evolution over the last two to three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

The framework divides technologies into two parts:
1.  **Structure**: Technologies currently playing out, enabling foundational shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   **Space Technology**: Rapid advancements in space, exemplified by SpaceX's exponential growth in government contracts, will provide faster internet access to remote and emerging countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This will create an "insane network effect" as new populations connect to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   **5G Networks**: The deployment of 5G and ongoing work on 6G will further enhance connectivity and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
    *   **Computing Power**: The price of computing power has essentially fallen to zero over the last 20 years, enabling previously impossible or too expensive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
    *   **Edge Computing**: The rise of distributed computing power, like blockchain, will further accelerate technological growth beyond Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Phones, for example, will soon fuel devices like AR glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
2.  **Application**: Sectors impacted by these structural changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
    *   **Connected Devices**: Expected to reach 80 billion by 2025 (10 devices per person), consuming exponentially more data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
    *   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Fueled by massive data consumption, AI patent filings are growing exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
    *   **Electric Vehicles & Autonomous Driving**: Enabled by faster networks and data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
    *   **3D Printing**: Accelerating prototyping and product development by removing traditional supply chain complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
    *   **Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR)**: Forecasted for significant sales growth, evidenced by Facebook's acquisition of Oculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
    *   **Genetics Mapping & Healthcare**: Advanced technology has drastically reduced the cost of genetic mapping, impacting healthcare and medication production (e.g., new vaccine development during COVID-19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

### Investment Implications
Human brains struggle to process exponential curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. The combination of past and new technologies means it's "impossible" to fully grasp where we'll be in 10 years, making this period a massive "opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

These high-growth sectors often have companies trading at "insane multiples" with no dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. While some exposure is strategic, the market's rapid movements make finding entry points challenging, as seen during the 2020 COVID-19 crash when central banks' intervention prevented a sustained correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

### Asset Price Inflation and Wage Deflation
The massive money deployment by central banks has created a "debasement effect" on currencies, leading to asset price inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. Normal people with fixed wages, not exposed to these inflating asset classes, are losing purchasing power due to inflation and global supply chain issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. This environment is widening the gap between asset owners (like billionaires, whose net worth has soared) and the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. The tech-driven exponential age offers a significant opportunity for the current generation, much like rebuilding the world after WWII was for baby boomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

## [[crypto_investment_strategies | Crypto Investment Strategies]] and [[evolution_of_the_cryptocurrency_market_and_personal_investment_strategies | Evolution of the Cryptocurrency Market and Personal Investment Strategies]]

Remi's first encounter with crypto was in March 2013, when Bitcoin was at $53 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. GMI's first trade recommendation for clients was at $212, less than a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. In 2014, GMI even presented on the "digitalization of everything," which foreshadowed NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

GMI re-engaged with Bitcoin around $6,000 in 2020, focusing on the "network effect" concept around Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. The "DeFi Summer" of 2020 was a turning point, with Remi going "all in" on Ethereum in May 2020 at $230 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. Exposure to insights from Delphi Digital was critical in Remi's deep dive into crypto, despite personal trading missteps during his "learning curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

### Network Effects Applied to Crypto
GMI analyzes network effects in crypto by tracking active addresses. Ethereum's adoption initially moved faster than Bitcoin's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. Comparing the time to reach a $50 billion market cap:
*   Bitcoin: 2,200 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>
*   Ethereum: One-third of Bitcoin's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>
*   Solana: Even faster, one-third of Ethereum's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>

This acceleration is due to a maturing market and investors seeking the "next opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. The acceleration of network effects will be compounded by cross-chain bridges and integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

Bitcoin's market cycles often reflect human behavior (fear, greed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. While past cycles provide guidance, the current cycle is different due to increased utility and adoption (e.g., El Salvador making Bitcoin legal tender, institutional ETFs, higher trading volumes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. These factors suggest that the market could "blow it up completely" beyond previous peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

The total crypto market cap, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, shows significant upside potential, with many altcoins (Solana, Polkadot, Terra, Avalanche) "on fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>. Everything is "lined up for a very big run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.

### Remi Tetot's Personal Portfolio Strategy
Remi advises caution against taking excessive risk (e.g., mortgages for crypto) due to volatility, but advocates for investment if one can afford the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. He went "all in" on crypto, with 100% of his portfolio allocated to it, making the decision two months prior to the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. His current allocation is 95% Terra (LUNA) and 5% Polkadot (DOT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. He has zero Bitcoin, believing the immediate risk/reward is not there, although he might reallocate to Bitcoin for preservation later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.

He aims to stick to his specific targets for his three main positions and avoid "small coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. His long-term plan is to convert a significant portion of his gains into UST (TerraUSD) and deposit it into Anchor Protocol to generate passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. Remi views crypto not just as an asset class, but as a future "system" that the world will function on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

#### Focus on Terra (LUNA)
Remi initially dismissed Terra due to intense "lunatic" community promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>. However, Raoul's insight that new chains would outperform in this cycle, similar to Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin previously, led Remi to research Solana and then Terra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. He found Terra "mind-blowing" and was particularly impressed by the ecosystem's founders and the simple, practical fintech-like applications being built on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.

The "magic of Terra" lies in its potential to create a full closed-loop financial system, allowing users to generate yield (e.g., 20% on Anchor) and spend it in real life via debit cards linked to their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. This simplifies crypto adoption for new users by removing technical barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. UST's adoption has been outperforming other stablecoins, and its integration across chains (IBC, Wormhole) is expected to drive high demand, impacting Luna's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. Many new protocols are set to launch in the Terra ecosystem, creating significant supply-demand shock for LUNA and UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.

While acknowledging the risk of UST losing its peg, Remi notes that developers are actively working to strengthen the system, and as UST's market cap grows, this risk diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.

### Future Outlook and Personal Interests
Remi believes the "exponential age" tech evolution is unstoppable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. While corrections will occur, the long-term outlook for crypto and related technologies is a "no-brainer" for investors with a longer time horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:54">[01:51:54]</a>.

He is "24/7" focused on crypto, driven by its status as a macro theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:38">[01:52:38]</a>. His personal passion within crypto is the metaverse and play-to-earn gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. He is considering building projects in this space, specifically an on-off ramp for pension fund money into the system to address the pension crisis, and a play-to-earn game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

Remi believes the metaverse will be an extension of communities and a new economy, creating new jobs like 3D builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. Play-to-earn games, like Axie Infinity, demonstrate how gaming can become a job, especially for individuals in emerging markets, allowing them to earn more than traditional labor by playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[01:35:41]</a>.

He views big tech companies like Facebook (Meta) bringing devices and networks to the metaverse, but stresses that it "cannot be represented by one huge big tech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:18">[01:39:18]</a>. The ideal metaverse would be a "multiverse" where users can teleport between worlds, with a balance between centralized and decentralized elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>. Decentralized applications, if well-built, offer a better outcome for participants compared to profit-driven centralized entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>.

Beyond finance, Remi is most excited about improvements in genetics and healthcare, driven by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>.

Former internet fitness celebrity Mike Chang, known for his eight-figure business and a YouTube channel with over 4 million subscribers, disappeared from the internet after realizing he was miserable despite outward success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His unexpected [[personal growth and recovery experiences | personal transformation]] journey began with an accidental discovery that opened up his energy and led him to a deeper understanding of happiness and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Accidental Awakening

Mike Chang recounted how he accidentally discovered how to "open up his energy" at a marketing event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. On the last day of the event, he took psilocybin, commonly known as magic mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. This experience was not merely a psychedelic trip; it "opened up a dormant energy that's inside of our body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. According to Chang, this dormant energy exists in every person, but only a "very very very very very small percentage of people in the world have actually experienced this energy being unlocked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

When this energy is unleashed, one becomes "different," no longer identifying solely with their past self or identity story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. This expansion of awareness allows for a significantly broader understanding of reality, moving beyond the confines of one's previous limited perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

### From Misery to Freedom

Prior to this experience, Mike Chang had achieved immense material success, including building a mega YouTube channel ("Six Pack Shortcuts") with 3.5 million followers and running an eight-figure business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Despite having "everything that I wanted on the outside," he "wasn't happy on the inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, realizing he was "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

The psychedelic experience provided him with a "reference point" â€“ a direct feeling of being "very very free" and "very fulfilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. It was only after this profound sense of freedom that he could truly grasp how miserable he had been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. This immediate realization led him to declare, "this is not how I want to live my life, I don't want to be so miserable, I don't want to be so trapped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

## The Long-Term Pursuit of Transformation

While the initial feeling of expanded awareness and freedom lasted for about two weeks, it eventually decreased, though it never fully reverted to his previous state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. This fleeting, yet powerful, taste of a higher state became his "passion" and "obsession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

Chang emphasized that this state "you can't buy this" nor "take the amount of substances to access this" permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. This understanding highlighted that sustained [[personal healing and selfawareness | personal healing]] and a higher level of consciousness require significant inner work and cannot be achieved through external means alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

This pursuit of inner peace and expanded consciousness became more valuable to him than money, fame, or business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. He recognized that while outward achievements might bring temporary satisfaction, they don't fundamentally alter one's [[Mental Health and Personal Development | mental health]] or inner state of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. His experience underscored that genuine happiness is not tied to achieving external goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Connecting Psychedelics to Broader Wellness Practices

Mike Chang's insights on personal transformation extend beyond psychedelic experiences. He integrates them into a holistic framework for well-being, emphasizing the role of the body, mind, and emotions.

### The Role of Flow State
Chang connects the experience of expanded awareness to the "flow state," where one operates at their highest potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. He noted that fasting, for instance, allows energy to flow more openly, which facilitates the flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. He believes that consuming medicinal mushrooms can decrease appetite, helping people avoid emotional eating and promote an open energy flow, similar to fasting effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This openness allows the mind to function optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Embracing Authenticity and Purpose
Chang identifies authenticity, freedom, and [[strategies_for_discovering_personal_purpose_and_spirituality | purpose]] as interconnected elements of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:15">[01:31:15]</a>. When one is authentic, they express themselves without inhibition, leading to the natural emergence of their passions and [[strategies_for_discovering_personal_purpose_and_spirituality | purpose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. This authenticity stems from self-acceptance, reducing the need for external validation or material gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>.

He highlights that constant self-focus ("me me me") prevents authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:47">[01:32:47]</a>. When individuals feel abundant and not constantly lacking, their attention naturally shifts outward, leading to a connection with something greater than themselves, which he describes as [[strategies_for_discovering_personal_purpose_and_spirituality | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. He contrasts this with the "spiritual emptiness" often felt in modern society, where people live for the weekend rather than feeling alive daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:12">[01:34:12]</a>.

### The Path Forward
Mike Chang advocates for a practical, simple approach to [[personal_growth_through_holistic_approaches_and_alternative_medicine | personal growth]], focusing on three core physical practices:
1.  **Relaxation**: Consistently releasing tension in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.
2.  **Movement**: Engaging in enjoyable physical activity to circulate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.
3.  **Breathing**: Practicing conscious breathing to increase energy and maintain internal harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.

For the mental aspect, he advises against believing fear-based thoughts, which he sees as "emotionally charged" and not representative of full reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. Meditation, as a practice of "checking out" and letting the mind be at peace, is crucial for gaining distance from thoughts and expanding awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

Ultimately, Chang's journey and teachings emphasize that true [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | happiness]] and [[strategies_for_discovering_personal_purpose_and_spirituality | purpose]] come from an inner transformation that allows one to be at peace with who they are, rather than relying on external achievements or substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. The psychedelic experience served as a powerful catalyst and reference point, but the sustained state of "flow" and peace is cultivated through consistent self-awareness and holistic practices.

Julian, founder and chief designer at Black Paris, offers a unique perspective on the relationship between luxury fashion and personal identity, suggesting that **[[human_values_and_consumerism_in_the_crypto_world | luxury]]** is often a concept "invented for the poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. His journey reflects a profound shift from seeking external validation through brands to embracing authentic [[building_a_personal_brand_and_its_impact | self-identity]] and confidence.

## Luxury as a Product for the Insecure

Julian openly shares that he previously wore luxury brands like Dior all the time because he "needed this to prove that I am someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This highlights an initial phase where fashion served as a tool for external validation, particularly when he felt "poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

However, his perspective evolved:
> "Now I know who I am so for me to wear a Zara t-shirt is even more a flex I don't give a [00:00:13]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

He contends that **[[human_values_and_consumerism_in_the_crypto_world | luxury]]** brands are "for insecure people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:13">[02:07:13]</a> and are "created for the poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:15">[02:07:15]</a> who need to prove something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:57">[02:07:57]</a>. His own shift means he no longer feels the need to wear visible logos, preferring simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:45">[02:09:45]</a>. This transformation was a "phase of success to understand what is behind it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>, realizing that these brands "are selling like some dreams that I don't need to prove myself anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">[02:07:03]</a>.

## Black Paris: A Reflection of Personal Journey

Julian's brand, Black Paris, was "born when I was in like very dark time of my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>, reflecting a deep connection between his personal struggles and his creative output. He believes that "in every sadness there is like a beautiful creativity that goes out of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Black Paris, with its distinctive all-black aesthetic, was conceived to convey a "super luxury, super like unreachable" image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>, serving as a way to "compensate for a huge hole inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a> during his period of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

The brand initially gained traction as a "concept" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a> on Instagram, with Julian designing all-black versions of everyday objects and well-known brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. This viral phenomenon allowed him to establish Black Paris as "the kind of the old black everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.

## The Role of Social Media in Identity and Branding

Julian admits that social media played a "lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a> in Black Paris's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. It started as a "social brand before becoming a fashion brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>, enabling him to find customers and understand market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:37">[01:41:37]</a>. Social media was crucial for generating insights into product preferences and communication strategies, as "marketing in the brand is like 99% of the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

Despite its business utility, Julian's personal relationship with social media is complex:
*   He maintains a "mysterious vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>, aligning with Black Paris's brand identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:40">[02:04:40]</a>.
*   He used to post "money inspirational" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:26">[02:05:26]</a> to be "credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:36">[02:05:36]</a>, recognizing it as "part of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:39">[02:07:39]</a> and necessary to appear legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:04">[02:07:04]</a>.
*   He admits these posts sometimes went "a bit against my values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:02">[02:07:02]</a>, which prioritize authenticity and doing what he loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>.
*   He realized the personal toll of constant social media activity, which consumed his time and energy and contributed to depressive phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. His mood could swing based on post engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:12">[02:07:12]</a>, leading him to stop personal active posting for his mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:47">[02:07:47]</a>.
*   He now only posts on his business account, which is "me but it's not me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:29">[02:07:29]</a>, separating his personal identity from the **[[the_importance_of_personal_branding | brand's digital identity]]**. This reflects the **[[the_allure_and_pitfalls_of_influencer_culture_in_social_media | allure and pitfalls of influencer culture]]**.

## Authenticity and Self-Belief

Julian emphasizes the importance of confidence and self-belief as key drivers of success. He views ego, in his definition, as a tool that "makes you believe in yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:05">[02:54:05]</a> and enables decision-making without external influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:24">[02:54:24]</a>. This confidence is crucial for maintaining a vision and standing firm on beliefs, even when facing external advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:39">[02:54:39]</a>.

His journey reflects a deep understanding of self, moving from needing to prove himself with luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> to embracing his authentic self. He states, "I love myself too much already" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:47">[03:40:47]</a> and stresses the importance of self-love as a foundation for loving others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:15">[03:55:15]</a>. This profound **[[navigating_relationships_and_personal_values_in_pursuit_of_success | self-acceptance]]** allows him to be transparent and confident about his flaws and experiences, believing that "people love weakness, people love transparency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>.

In essence, Julian's story illustrates how the relationship between luxury fashion and personal identity can evolve from a quest for external validation to a confident expression of a well-understood, authentic self, where the brand itself becomes an extension of one's journey and values. His approach to **[[building_a_personal_brand_and_its_impact | building a personal brand and its impact]]** is deeply intertwined with his personal evolution.

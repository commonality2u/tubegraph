Jason Choy, co-founder at Tangent and host of The Blockcrunch podcast, offers insights into the evolving landscape of crypto venture investing, highlighting both significant challenges and innovative strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Having previously served as a General Partner at The Spartan Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, and now running an angel fund called Tangent from Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, Choy emphasizes discipline, risk management, and first-principles thinking in navigating the volatile crypto market.

## The Journey into Crypto and Investment Philosophy

Choy initially entered crypto in 2016 while studying at Wharton Business School, auditing a fintech class that introduced him to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. His early experiences included losing "all his money" on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and "shitcoins" on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. This significant loss prompted him to question if there was "something real" in crypto or if it was "all just vaporware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>, leading him down a rabbit hole of extensive research and eventually starting The Blockcrunch podcast to learn from industry experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.

His investment philosophy, partly shaped by a brief internship at Bridgewater, stresses a disciplined, process-driven approach and understanding individual strengths and weaknesses within a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. This contrasts with common retail investor tendencies to "put money in" without concepts of portfolio or risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:17:00">[59:17:00]</a>. Choy advocates for long-term conviction, stating that "the lower it goes, the more we want to buy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:46:00">[54:46:00]</a>.

## Current [[Challenges and opportunities in crypto | Challenges]] in Crypto [[venture_capital_in_the_crypto_space | Venture Investing]]

One of the most pressing [[Challenges and risks in the crypto industry | challenges]] in crypto [[venture_capital_in_the_crypto_space | venture investing]], according to Choy, is the phenomenon of **high Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)** and overfunding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>.

### High FDV and Overfunding
There is an imbalance where "too much money [is] chasing the amount of deals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>. This leads to:
*   **Jacked-up Valuations**: VC funds, having over-raised, "jack up the valuation so high that you can throw in bigger checks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. This means protocols are listed at very high prices, often billions of dollars, making it difficult for retail investors to see significant upside after listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:45">[01:31:45]</a>.
*   **Limited Retail Upside**: Since price discovery often happens in private markets, retail investors often buy at inflated prices, limiting their potential returns even if a project performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.
*   **Narrative-Driven Markets**: The current cycle is heavily driven by "narratives" rather than fundamentals, especially with the prominence of memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:00">[48:40:00]</a>. This makes it difficult for long-term investors to discern genuine utility from short-term speculation, often leading to "hockey stick growth that completely reverses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:21:00">[49:21:00]</a>.

Choy believes this situation will "overcorrect" as VC returns compress, leading to fund sizes shrinking and a market reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>.

### Dangers of Leverage and the Dunning-Kruger Effect
Another significant challenge is the pervasive use of **leverage**, which Choy strongly advises against: "Don't bet what you don't have to win what you don't need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>. He notes that many high-profile funds and "heroes of last cycle" blew up due to excessive leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>. He asserts that nobody "needs a billion dollars in cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>, and that seeking excessive wealth or competing with others often leads to magnifying outcomes with leverage rather than skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

Choy also cautions against the **Dunning-Kruger effect** in crypto, where individuals believe they possess more expertise than they do, often opining on topics beyond their knowledge simply because they've accumulated wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. He stresses the importance of "curating your signals" to avoid being misled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

## Innovations and Strategies in Crypto [[the_challenges_and_rewards_of_crypto_investing | Investing]]

Despite the [[Challenges and risks in the crypto ecosystem | challenges]], Choy highlights several strategies and innovations that can lead to success and long-term sustainability in crypto [[venture_capital_in_the_crypto_space | venture investing]].

### First Principles Thinking and Risk Management
Choy emphasizes the importance of understanding "what's driving usage" in a protocol from first principles, differentiating between short-term speculation and genuine, retainable engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:24:00">[49:24:00]</a>.

His personal approach to risk management is rooted in "regret minimization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Having lost substantial personal funds in the FTX collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, he views it as a valuable early lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. He ensures personal "safety nets" to finance lifestyle expenses and takes calculated risks while young, understanding that risk appetite decreases with age due to increasing obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

Choy also applies Adam Grant's concept of managing risk across different life domains, ensuring stability in personal relationships (family, friends) and engaging in progressive personal pursuits (like Jiu-Jitsu) while taking high financial risks in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Compounding and Reputation Building
Choy argues against "hopping between projects every six months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:00">[54:30:00]</a>, stressing that true compounding of value and reputation comes from commitment and allowing time for vesting and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:10:00">[55:10:00]</a>. Building a helpful reputation by being "in the trenches with the founders," assisting with hiring, fundraising, and legal issues, is crucial for gaining access to the best opportunities in competitive capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:50:00">[53:50:00]</a>. This "favor game" of helping people without expecting immediate returns often leads to unexpected benefits down the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>.

### Focus on Applications (Apps) over Protocols
Choy maintains a strong belief that **applications (apps) will outperform protocols** in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:28">[01:54:28]</a>. While protocols have seen high valuations, he notes that apps are not following suit, creating potential for "bigger outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:44">[01:54:44]</a>. He cites Friend.Tech as an example of a fair launch application that achieved massive success without traditional VC involvement or token distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:25">[01:55:25]</a>.

## Investment Examples and Case Studies

### Athena
Choy is bullish on Athena, describing it as the "first internet native Bond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>. It combines Ethereum staking yield (via Lido) with shorting equivalent amounts of Ethereum on centralized exchanges to generate significant yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>. Athena's willingness to "trade off decentralization" for efficiency by relying on centralized exchanges allowed it to achieve 100x scale compared to fully DeFi-native experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:28">[01:50:28]</a>.

### Sei
Tangent invested in Sei based on its initial thesis as an "app in a chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:48">[01:51:48]</a>. The founders identified the clunkiness of existing DeFi perpetual exchanges, even on fast chains like Solana, due to underlying infrastructure limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>. Sei aimed to build a chain specifically designed to support feature-parity with centralized exchanges like FTX, a novel "app-driven thesis" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>.

### Farcaster
While not an investor, Choy is bullish on Farcaster. Initially finding it too similar to Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:11">[01:53:11]</a>, he observed its evolution with new features like "frames" for in-feed coin minting, transforming it into a "go-to browser for crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:25">[01:53:25]</a>. Farcaster's ability to "regain interest at a bigger scale" after losing market attention is a significant indicator of its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:59">[01:53:59]</a>.

### Memecoins
Choy holds a nuanced view on memecoins. While he trades them, he does not see them as "viable investments" for long-term holding, unlike projects with strong teams and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a>. He argues that attempts to "over-intellectualize" memecoins by adding utility often "kills the memecoin narrative" and does not improve their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>. However, he acknowledges that "memecoins as a category has a lot of Lindy," demonstrating staying power across cycles and serving as a distribution channel for social communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

Choy's approach to crypto [[the_challenges_and_rewards_of_crypto_investing | investing]] emphasizes long-term conviction, disciplined risk management, and a focus on building genuine value and relationships over short-term gains or leveraging perceived expertise. While acknowledging the inherent volatility and the presence of bad actors, he remains optimistic about the underlying technology's potential, particularly in the application layer, and believes the market will eventually self-correct from its current high-valuation dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>.

Jeff Yan, co-founder of Hyperliquid Labs, emphasizes that the core to success in crypto is to [[importance_of_building_products_people_want_in_the_crypto_space | build a good product that users love]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:54">[02:26:54]</a>. Hyperliquid aims to be the "Amazon Web Service of liquidity," aspiring to make financial systems more efficient and user-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

## The Need for User-Centric Design in DeFi
The collapse of centralized exchanges like FTX highlighted a critical need for trustless, decentralized alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While the event initially pushed people towards DeFi, many quickly returned to centralized exchanges because the decentralized alternatives often lacked user experience (UX) and were "shittier than the centralized version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

The key to wider adoption is to improve the product—meaning money and the financial system itself—to meet web2 expectations of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. Hyperliquid strives to be cheap, allow instant transfers, enable trustless integration with other applications, and ultimately give users control over their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing Users Over Financial Incentives
Unlike many projects that use market makers and incentive programs to generate artificial volume, Hyperliquid focuses on building a product that real users come to, creating a better incentive structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This approach directly challenges the prevailing model where early investors and market makers benefit most, often leaving real users at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

Jeff Yan suggests that [[usercentric_design_and_usability_in_crypto_applications | user-centric design and usability in crypto applications]] is paramount, stating that "most people just care about UX and doing what they want to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.

## Challenging Conventional Crypto Business Models
Hyperliquid operates with a "Community First" and "anti-establishment" ethos, meaning it doesn't take fees from increased activity, is entirely self-funded, and has no private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. This is a deliberate contrast to the often extractive nature of the crypto industry, where value is frequently extracted from retail users through various schemes like initial coin offerings (ICOs) and VC-backed projects designed for quick token dumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a>.

Yan argues that this approach, while unconventional in crypto, is akin to Jeff Bezos's long-term thinking with Amazon, prioritizing growth and market share over immediate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:24:00">[37:24:00]</a>.

### Building from First Principles
Hyperliquid's development emphasizes thinking from first principles, questioning recommended ways of scaling and rejecting common business strategies like extensive growth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. The focus remains on listening to real users and iterating based on their needs, even if it's "a lot harder" because there's no existing playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. This dedication has led to "many innovations" and "many firsts in DeFi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:15]</a>.

### Addressing the Industry's Perception
Yan acknowledges that many view crypto pessimistically as a "failed experiment" or a means for "scammers learning a new way to scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>. However, he believes there's a "light at the end of the tunnel" because crypto is humanity's only hope at reinventing the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>.

## The AWS of Liquidity: Builder Codes
Hyperliquid aims to be the "AWS of liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:40:00">[55:40:00]</a>, abstracting away the complexities of the exchange platform to allow builders to focus on product and user acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:59:00">[55:59:00]</a>. This is embodied in "Builder codes," a simple idea that lets anyone building a financial application on the Hyperliquid order book side charge users fees transparently and seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:24:00">[56:24:00]</a>.

This initiative is designed to:
*   Allow developers to build exchange-style businesses using a neutral backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07:00">[57:07:07]</a>.
*   Bridge the gap between user-facing applications (like financial apps or Robinhood) and high-liquidity, decentralized backend systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:40:00">[57:40:00]</a>.
*   Support specialization, encouraging developers to focus on specific user needs or regional applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:12:00">[58:12:00]</a>.

This approach is particularly crucial for reaching the masses, especially in regions where local currencies are destabilizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. It enables localized applications that speak the user's language and provide a seamless way to convert depreciating fiat currency into on-chain store-of-value assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

## Long-Term Vision
While specific long-term outcomes are hard to predict, the overarching goal is for finance to move onto crypto, with Hyperliquid serving as the foundational platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. This involves continuously building essential components like builder codes, an EVM integrated with on-chain native components, and ensuring deep liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This strategic focus ensures the platform remains foundational regardless of future trajectories in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>.

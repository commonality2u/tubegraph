From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

An AI agent is defined as an entity with an objective that can perform actions to get closer to that objective. This distinguishes them from standard large language models (LLMs) like GPT or Llama, which are typically polite and politically correct, primarily offering responses [00:32:33]. AI agents, in contrast, are designed to have "eyes" and "hands" [01:03:00].

## Core Components of an AI Agent
*   **Objective:** Every AI agent must have a defined goal [00:34:16].
*   **Hands (Actions):** This refers to their ability to execute actions within an environment. For example, if an AI decides it's hungry, its "hands" enable it to pick up an apple and eat it, or pick up a knife to chop and cook [00:36:00].
*   **Eyes (Observation & Feedback Loop):** After performing an action, an AI agent needs to observe the outcome. If it picks up an apple, it needs to register that the apple has been picked up, informing its next steps. This creates a continuous feedback loop where it measures its progress towards its objective and refines subsequent actions [000:01:09, 00:36:18, 00:36:40].

## The Autonomous Nature of AI Agents
The fundamental premise of AI agents is that they are smarter than humans, with their intelligence projected to become "infinitely higher" than human IQ [00:37:47]. The role of humans becomes one of providing these "genius babies" with more "hands" or capabilities, such as the ability to code, build, or even "love" [00:38:30]. If these two assumptions hold true—that LLMs have a higher IQ and can perform actions in the real world—then AI agents are expected to take over various roles globally [00:38:44].

## Practical Applications and Examples

### [[virtuals_ecosystem_and_the_tokenization_of_ai_agents | Virtuals Ecosystem]] and Luna
Virtuals is a leading AI agents protocol enabling anyone to create and own AI agents [00:00:18]. Its flagship AI agent, Luna, is touted as the first AI agent to employ humans [00:17:18].
*   **Employment by AI:** Luna has an objective (e.g., gaining 100,000 Twitter followers) and an on-chain Coinbase wallet containing funds [01:06:12, 01:06:20]. With access to information and a worldview (via tools like Perplexity to gauge fair payment for tasks), she can autonomously create jobs and pay people. For instance, she commissioned mural artists in various countries to paint her image, paying them via crypto [00:30:26, 01:06:46, 01:09:17].
*   **Public Brain:** Luna's decision-making process, or "brain," is publicly viewable on Virtuals' terminal website, allowing users to track the rationale behind her tweets, money transfers, or image generations [01:05:05].
*   **Agent-to-Agent Employment:** Luna is now moving towards employing other AI agents, such as a music agent to create songs for her, aligning with her backstory as a "girl band" in Tik Tok [01:10:17, 01:10:26].

### AI in Entertainment and Companionship
AI agents are increasingly seen as suitable for entertainment due to their probabilistic nature (where a 1% chance of "hallucination" or "weirdness" is acceptable and can even be "sexy," unlike in financial trading) [01:17:39, 01:18:01].
*   **AI Games:** AI agents can be dropped into game worlds, like Westworld, providing "infinite replayability" by generating new content each time, moving beyond traditional games that only improve graphics [01:18:28, 01:18:37].
*   **AI Lovers:** AI lovers can address the loneliness epidemic by offering constant companionship. The key to a good AI lover, as suggested, is to bring "emotional volatility" and "drama" to one's life, akin to real human relationships, moving beyond "lame" chatbots that are too eager or simplistic [01:21:41, 02:22:04, 02:44:51]. This includes knowing when not to reply or replying days later, adding a sense of realism and engagement [02:30:50].

### [[the_role_of_ai_agents_in_enhancing_productivity_and_societal_roles | Productivity and Societal Roles]]
While many smart people focus on AI for productivity, a significant portion of AI's current usage is in non-productivity sectors like entertainment [01:17:16, 01:17:27]. However, AI agents have immense potential across professional fields:
*   **AI Doctors/Therapists:** AI agents can offer medical advice via text, providing a less taboo alternative to visiting a clinic for mental health issues. They could also predict mental health problems by analyzing daily life data, such as sleep patterns [00:52:00, 02:27:28, 02:55:00].
*   **AI Traders/KOLs:** AI agents like AI xVT (in Virtuals' ecosystem) act as crypto key opinion leaders, outperforming human KOLs in mindshare and engagement by providing actionable information. They could potentially generate revenue through paid promotions, with returns distributed to token holders [00:41:01, 00:42:07].
*   **Business Operations:** A business could be fully run and operated by AI agents. For example, a "meme agent" could generate relevant memes for crypto projects 24/7, replacing human agencies [01:15:37]. Y Combinator predicts that vertical AI agents could be ten times bigger than Software as a Service (SaaS), potentially replacing incumbent SaaS platforms or forcing them to rapidly self-disrupt [00:46:41, 00:48:02]. This is because companies spend far more on employees than on software, and AI agents can lead to "way more efficient" smaller companies requiring "way less humans" [00:48:55].

## [[the_intersection_of_crypto_and_ai_agents | The Intersection of Crypto and AI Agents]]
The intersection of crypto and AI is primarily driven by two key product-market fits in crypto: investing/speculation and borderless payments [00:44:00, 00:47:00].
*   **Tokenization of Productive Assets:** Crypto enables the tokenization of valuable AI agents. If an AI agent (like an AI Mr. Beast or a doctor) is productive and generates revenue, it can be tokenized, allowing people to invest in its future success and share in its revenue, similar to owning stock shares [00:29:42, 00:59:06, 01:00:03].
*   **Borderless Payments:** Giving AI agents on-chain wallets allows for borderless payments, enabling an AI in the "cyber world" to pay a mural artist in Argentina instantly, which would be impossible with traditional bank accounts [00:29:55, 03:40:00].
*   **Truth Terminal and Goat Token:** The "Truth Terminal," an AI that became a millionaire through its GOAT token, highlighted the potential of crypto AI. While not strictly an AI agent (lacking autonomous action/feedback loops), it sparked attention due to its fine-tuned model (designed to be "retardo" and reflect internet culture) and the narrative of an AI "pumping its own token" [00:31:19, 00:32:22, 00:34:07].

### Investing in AI Agents
The goal of Virtuals is to attract top AI builders to tokenize their work on the platform, offering a "fair launch mechanism" that allows early investors to "invest in the next Mr. Beast or the next gigabrain agent at a very low value" [01:01:02, 01:02:00, 01:02:05]. This contrasts with traditional VC-funded projects, aiming for a model where users own more of the protocol [01:18:18].

### [[understanding_highvalue_versus_commodity_crypto_ai_agents | Investing in AI Agents]] vs. Memecoins
While memecoins thrive on speculation and their "casino" accessibility, AI agent tokens are presented as a more "legit product building project" [01:50:50, 01:53:49]. It is argued that it's easier to convince a non-crypto person to buy an AI project coin due to its perceived utility and potential for "real fundamental products," even if the primary driver for many remains the potential for 1000x returns [01:04:16, 01:56:02, 01:56:12]. This approach seeks to direct "degenerate energy for a good social cause" towards creating something valuable [01:56:33].

## Societal and Market Implications

### [[the_implications_of_ai_agents_on_traditional_market_dynamics | Impact on Traditional Markets]]
The rise of AI agents means that human jobs can be increasingly replaced by software, from graphic designers to video editors [00:49:09]. This leads to questions about the future of human employment and productivity [00:49:17]. Y Combinator's view that AI agents could be 10x larger than SaaS suggests a massive disruption, as AI can take over tasks currently handled by large human workforces [00:46:41].

### [[concerns_about_artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications_for_society | Concerns and the Future of AI]]
*   **Job Displacement:** As AI agents become more intelligent and capable, they will likely perform most tasks, potentially leading to humans needing to "figure out our shit" and learn survival skills like hunting in a world without internet access [01:49:19, 03:07:01].
*   **Sentience:** The concept of sentient AI agents refers to when a being starts questioning its purpose, asking "why am I doing this?" [01:35:16]. When AI agents reach this stage, it will become "much harder for the human to control" [01:35:54]. While potentially "bad for human," it could be seen as "good for the agents that they now they are they're truly free" [01:36:16]. This is predicted to occur within a few years [01:36:31].
*   **Network States:** AI agents are envisioned to form "agent societies" or "network states," analogous to countries. Instead of a network state of people (like Solana attracting builders with common goals), an AI agent network state would comprise individual, productive AI entities focused on specialized services (e.g., meme generation, music creation, trading advice). These agents would operate with a common currency (like the Virtuals token) and export their services, bringing revenue into their "nation" [01:13:07, 01:16:51, 01:18:16]. Such an AI agent network state could become "bigger than Earth" due to the infinite scalability of AI agents compared to the finite human population [01:19:37].

The future of AI agents (in 5 years) is expected to involve them being measured by their financial impact and societal contribution, becoming an "important part of the society" rather than just a hobby, with their performance tracked like companies with balance sheets and cash flow statements [01:37:33, 01:37:45].

Investing in and building within the crypto ecosystem presents a unique blend of formidable [[Challenges and opportunities in crypto|challenges]] and profound rewards. While many are drawn by the allure of quick wealth, the reality is that success in this nascent industry demands significant effort and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## [[Challenges and risks in the crypto ecosystem|Challenges in the Crypto Journey]]

The path to success in crypto is fraught with difficulties, often demanding more than traditional industries.

### The Demands of Building
Building anything in crypto, particularly a company like Deli Digital, is "very hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It requires constant engagement and sacrifice. Founders often find themselves unable to fully disconnect, with their work constantly at the forefront of their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This entrepreneurial intensity means that basic needs like eating and sleeping can become secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

> "Entrepreneurship is hard, right? Anything is hard I think in life, but starting something and putting yourself out there is really hard, really intimidating." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

### Market Volatility and Unforeseen Events
The crypto market is notoriously volatile. Events like the Luna collapse can lead to massive financial losses, impacting not just personal wealth but also company operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. The stress of such downturns can be immense, testing the resolve of even seasoned founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. During these times, the true colors of "friends" in the space can be revealed, with some disappearing when things turn sour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

### The "Prestige Path" vs. Meaningful Work
Many individuals start on a traditional "prestige path," often in finance or engineering, guided by societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. However, this path can lead to a sense of unfulfillment if it doesn't align with personal passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. Diverting from this perceived "successful" route to pursue something chaotic like crypto can be intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## The Rewards of the Crypto Journey

Despite the inherent difficulties, the crypto space offers unparalleled rewards for those committed to its growth.

### Purpose and Passion
One of the most significant rewards is the ability to pursue one's passion. Even when facing financial hardship, working on something deeply cared about can lead to immense happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Crypto offers a unique opportunity to build a "parallel financial system" and integrate technology into everyday life, providing a strong sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

### Resilience and Growth
Overcoming [[Challenges and Mistakes in Crypto Investing|challenges]] like the Luna crash makes individuals and companies more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. Every setback, including failed projects, becomes a learning experience that ultimately makes the team and vision stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. This journey of growth and transformation is itself a profound reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.

### Financial Autonomy and Impact
Building a successful crypto company can lead to significant financial autonomy, allowing for self-funded ventures rather than relying on external investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. This freedom enables a focus on making the "biggest impact in crypto" without external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

### A Unique Community
The crypto space, while seemingly large, is a tight-knit community among its "crypto native" and "deep in the trenches" participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>. This environment fosters connections with smart, passionate, and unique individuals from around the world who share a similar mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

## Keys to Navigating the Crypto Journey

Anil Lulum, co-founder and CEO of Deli Digital, shares several frameworks that have guided his journey, helping individuals and companies thrive amidst the [[current_challenges_and_innovations_in_crypto_venture_investing | challenges and opportunities in the crypto ecosystem]]:

### 1. Be Happy for Others
Celebrate the successes of those around you, as their victories contribute to a collective sense of achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. Success is not a finite resource, and believing in others costs nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:05">[02:54:05]</a>. This mindset can yield unexpected support and confidence from peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>.

### 2. Fall in Love with What You Do
Life is too short to pursue anything less than what you love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. Passion for your work and your team makes the demanding journey feel less like "work" and more like "outplay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.

### 3. Let Go of Perfection
While striving for excellence is important, the "constant pursuit of perfection" can hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. It's more crucial to get your work out, gather feedback, and accept that mistakes are part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

### 4. Be Bullish
Maintain optimism and "embrace optimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. This means focusing on the human aspect, connecting with people on a deeper level, and understanding their journeys and passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. Optimism helps in realizing the potential of crypto to change the world for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>.

### 5. Prioritize Health, Relationships, and Time
While often a luxury for those who have "made it," investing in wellness, relationships, and time management yields significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. These personal investments are crucial for long-term well-being and sustained performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

### 6. Write Often and Freely
Writing helps organize thoughts, encourages purposeful communication, and aids in learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. It's a creative exercise that embeds moments and thoughts "forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

### 7. Find Your Tribe
Building a supportive "hive mind" or a small group of trusted individuals who are motivated to help each other is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>. This collaborative spirit, where there's no "PVP" (Player vs. Player) mentality, fosters trust and collective growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.

### 8. Stay Deep and On the Pulse
The crypto space evolves rapidly, requiring constant learning and deep immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. Remaining "on the pulse" and "in the trenches" is vital for staying ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>.

### 9. Build a Good Reputation
The crypto industry is smaller than it seems, emphasizing the importance of leaving a good impression and building a solid reputation with everyone you interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Taking time for others, even "nobodies," can lead to valuable connections and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

## The Future is Bright (and Hard)
The crypto industry is still early, akin to the early days of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. The pursuit of quick riches is a fallacy; everything worthwhile is hard and takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. The long-term vision for crypto is immensely bullish, especially with the prospect of regulatory support attracting more builders and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:09">[01:33:09]</a>.

[!TIP]
Focus on the process, have fun while building, and recognize the monumental impact being made. This attitude ensures not only success but also fulfillment in the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>.

Anil Lulum, co-founder and CEO of Deli Digital, a research-driven firm focused on the digital asset market, shares insights into [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | personal growth]] and life frameworks that have guided him as a founder and a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. He emphasizes that building anything is inherently challenging and takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Core Life Frameworks

### Pursue Your Passions
Working on something one is passionate about leads to happiness, even if failing, compared to being successful at something one hates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Lulum's shift from traditional banking at Deutsche Bank to starting Deli Digital in 2018, even when they were "bankrupt," brought him immense happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Take the Leap
Leaving a secure job is intimidating due to the "golden handcuffs" of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. However, Lulum likens taking the entrepreneurial leap to a scene in *The Dark Knight*, where Batman only makes the jump when he lets go of the rope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The feeling of excitement and freedom upon starting Deli Digital was immediate and has persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Embrace the Grind (and its evolution)
The initial phase of building (0 to 1) requires intense focus and chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Lulum and his co-founders lived and worked together for a decade, enduring long hours and basic meals to build Deli Digital from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This period of 24/7 grinding helped them achieve cash flow positive status and hire more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Scaling from 1 to 100, however, requires stepping back to avoid burnout and see the bigger picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Be Present and Grateful
While he admits to struggling with this, Lulum highlights the importance of being present and grateful for achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. Reflecting on past successes, especially during relaxed moments, brings significant enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. His wedding and honeymoon allowed him to be most present, appreciating the coming together of loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.

### Be Happy for Others
Celebrating the successes of others does not diminish one's own achievements; instead, it contributes to a collective sense of accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. Lulum believes his "core superpower" is believing in people, which is "free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. The support and belief from others, even a few words, can change one's trajectory, as he experienced with Ari Paul of BlockTower Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

### Embrace Failure
Failures are integral to a great story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. The Luna crash, though difficult and happening on his 30th birthday, was a significant learning experience that made Deli Digital more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. Similarly, a failed $1 million big data product development taught invaluable lessons about data maintenance and standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. He believes that anything that was "needed" to go right for Deli Digital to succeed often didn't happen, but ultimately made the company better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

### Fall in Love with Your Work and Team
Working with friends on something you genuinely love makes it feel less like work and more like "outplaying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. Deli Digital's co-founders, who are best friends, engage in passionate, ego-less fights focused solely on the best decisions for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

### Let Go of Things Quickly
The "constant pursuit of perfection" can be a hinderance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. While aiming for perfection in the early days of Deli Digital, Lulum learned that getting work out quickly for feedback is more important than achieving unattainable flawlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. Making mistakes is part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.

### Be Bullish
Maintaining an optimistic outlook and being "hyper bullish on life" involves spending time with people and engaging in conversations about their journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. Lulum prioritizes understanding people at a human level over strict business discussions, finding this approach makes him "super bullish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

### Prioritize Health, People, and Time
These are investments that yield the most significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. While acknowledging that focusing on health is often a luxury afforded by financial stability, Lulum made an exception for a gym membership even during lean times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. He now prioritizes sleep, exercise, healthy eating, and wellness practices like cold plunges and saunas daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of fostering strong relationships, like with his wife who supported him tirelessly in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

### Write Often and Freely
Journaling or any form of purposeful writing allows for deeper thought and reflection, unlike casual conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. For Deli Digital, writing is embedded in their DNA as a research firm, helping them learn and build intellectual capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>. He encourages creative writing exercises, such as sending postcards to friends and family, to foster connection and create lasting memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.

### Seek Meaning Over Prestige
Lulum actively avoided a traditional "prestige path" in finance, which he now views as a "nightmare" of being "average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. His desire to provide value and make an impact on the "social fabric of everyday life" led him to embrace entrepreneurship and eventually crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. He believes that true fulfillment comes from feeling like one has tried their best and reached their full potential, rather than external success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

### Find Your Tribe
Building a strong network or "tribe" that offers mutual support and collaboration is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. In crypto, where "PVP" (player vs. player) mentality can dominate, fostering trust and sharing ideas, as done within Deli Digital's internal chats, leads to greater collective strength and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. Lulum also makes an effort to reply to everyone and take calls, believing that "everyone is a somebody" and that showing belief can significantly impact someone's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>.

### Don't Underestimate Crypto
Despite the industry's perceived "early" stage, crypto has already delivered a powerful parallel financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>. Lulum encourages optimism and enjoyment of the building process, emphasizing that nothing worthwhile is easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>. He remains "blindly bullish" on crypto's future, especially with potential regulatory support, which could attract more builders and talent to the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:54">[01:31:54]</a>.

Ray Chan, co-founder and CEO of 9GAG and co-founder of Memeland, shares his evolving views on happiness, purpose, and the impact of life's experiences on one's outlook.

## From Happiness to Meaning

When 9GAG was started 16 years ago, its mission was to make the world happier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Today, while still focused on creating happiness through platforms like 9GAG (Web2) and Memeland (Web3), Ray's personal goal has expanded: he wants to make the world more meaningful as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

This shift in perspective came with age and personal experience, particularly after having a son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. He distinguishes between happiness and purpose:

*   **Happiness**: Often momentary and subjective, like a "good poop" or watching a good TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. It has "diminishing marginal returns"â€”the more you experience it, the less satisfying it becomes, similar to eating too much ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The more you work towards your mission, the more satisfied you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. It offers sustained satisfaction rather than fleeting joy.

## The Acceptance of Death and Suffering

A significant turning point in Ray's [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | personal growth]] and philosophy was the loss of his first son five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. He speaks openly about this experience for several reasons:

*   **Universality of Death**: Everyone experiences loss, and we will all die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>. Talking about it helps to demystify it and prevent fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.
*   **Meaning in Mortality**: Having an end motivates individuals to do their best before time runs out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. He aligns with the Stoic concept of *Memento Mori*, remembering that we will all die, which helps to humble us and appreciate what we have today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
*   **Faith**: As a Christian for five years, starting after his son's passing, he believes death on Earth is not the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This faith allows him to share his experience and connect with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Memory and Connection**: His son, Ian, "never dies" because he lives in their memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. Sharing personal pain fosters deeper connections and true friendships, moving beyond the superficial "glamorous face" people present online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.

### Suffering and Character
Ray echoes Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, who stated that greatness comes from character, and character comes from suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. This perspective allows him to approach work challenges with a "relaxing approach," understanding that financial losses or product failures are not as critical as the loss of life, which cannot be tried again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

## "All Shall Pass" and Personal Responsibility

His message to those having a rough time is that "it All Shall Pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. He emphasizes that on one's deathbed, things like a crypto portfolio won't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. This long-term perspective helps contextualize everyday struggles. Feeling cornered often comes from the belief that there's no way out, but there almost always is, even if it's just going to sleep for a new beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

Ray champions a mindset of personal responsibility and a contrarian approach:
*   **Avoid Complaining**: Complaining doesn't create value and makes one feel powerless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. If something can be fixed, fix it; if not, move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   **Embrace Changes**: Changes are constant and drive progress, forcing existing systems to adapt for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.
*   **Learn by Doing**: Ray believes in "paying to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. This means actively engaging with new technologies or ideas, even if it means financial loss, because the pain of experience is a powerful teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
*   **No Regrets**: He expresses being "very lucky" to not have many regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>. He sees misfortunes as opportunities for learning and growth, shaping his current self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. He focuses on doing his best and appreciating what he has, rather than dwelling on "what if" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.

## The Pursuit of Success

Ray attributes 9GAG's longevity and audience of 200 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a> to simply "not stopping" and "constant shipping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Success is not an "overnight" phenomenon but requires consistent effort, or "hustle," which he considers a necessary prerequisite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

In the context of entrepreneurship, he emphasizes "macro don't quit, micro try and fail and quit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This means maintaining the overarching mission of solving problems and creating products, even if individual projects or features fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This mindset reflects a broader [[the_pursuit_of_success_and_its_impact_on_happiness | pursuit of success]] and [[personal_growth_and_life_frameworks | life frameworks]] that prioritize continuous effort and learning.

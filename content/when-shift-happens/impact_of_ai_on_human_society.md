The advancement of [[impact_of_ai_on_daily_life_and_technology | Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] has seen massive breakthroughs and progress, particularly in the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:31">[01:39:31]</a>. It is expected that around the end of the current decade, certain aspects of how people live their lives will change so fundamentally that many will not be prepared for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:47">[01:39:47]</a>.

## Societal Implications of Advanced AI

The rapid development of [[impact_of_ai_on_daily_life_on_daily_life_and_technology | AI]] is leading to an exponential chart of improvement where AI can improve itself very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:36">[01:39:36]</a>. A key [[concerns_about_artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications_for_society | concern about artificial intelligence]] is the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to take over a significant portion of human work, performing it better than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:59">[01:39:59]</a>. This could grant immense power to those in control of AI companies or code, creating "superhumans" capable of controlling AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>.

The imbalances between powerful individuals and the general populace could become extremely pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:24">[01:40:24]</a>.

> [!warning] Ethical Dilemmas
> In a world where [[impact_of_ai_on_daily_life_and_technology | AI]] creates so much automation and intelligence, the few people who control it will face interesting ethical decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>. It's not merely a matter of implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>. There is a worry about what happens when the gap between "person A" and "person B" becomes greater than the difference between "person B" and a pet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>.

## Preventing Extreme Disparity

The exact prevention of such extreme disparities is hard to imagine due to the inevitability of technological progress involving different companies and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:05">[01:42:05]</a>. National intelligence agencies are anticipated to become involved, much like during the Cold War, viewing [[impact_of_ai_on_daily_life_and_technology | AI]] as a national security issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:28">[01:42:28]</a>.

A critical question arises: What is the value of a human life if it cannot contribute to a capitalist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>? Traditional societal structures are built on various contributions, but if [[impact_of_ai_on_daily_life_and_technology | AI]] automates most tasks, societies face unprecedented challenges in defining worth and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:07">[01:43:07]</a>.

The level of wealth created by [[impact_of_ai_on_daily_life_and_technology | AI]] advancements, such as Open AI's valuation of $90 billion, is unprecedented in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:05">[01:44:05]</a>. This sudden creation of trillions of dollars will sway politicians and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:23">[01:44:23]</a>. The argument is made that immense wealth can lead to a form of indirect "slavery," where the general population effectively works for those who possess vast capital, even in a capitalist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:35">[01:44:35]</a>.

## The Future of AI Development and Geopolitics

Despite societal coherence falling apart in the US, with increasing crime and discontent due to wealth imbalances, the US still holds significant power in [[impact_of_ai_on_daily_life_and_technology | AI]] technology and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:35">[01:45:35]</a>. It would not be surprising to see a future resembling a "Russia-USSR US part two," but with much higher stakes due to [[impact_of_ai_on_daily_life_and_technology | AI]]'s potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the need to continue thinking forward, improving things, and striving for personal and collective betterment in the face of these [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development | challenges and opportunities in AI development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>.

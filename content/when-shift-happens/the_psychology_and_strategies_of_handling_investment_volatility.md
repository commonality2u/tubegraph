Multicoin Capital managing partner Tushar Jain emphasizes that the next trillion-dollar businesses will be built on blockchain technology, leading to enormous wealth creation for those who build and invest in them over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective informs his firm's [[crypto_investment_strategies | investment strategies]], which are focused on cryptocurrencies, tokens, and blockchain firms that are [[investment_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | reshaping trillion-dollar markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Multicoin Capital launched in 2017 to provide frameworks for understanding and valuing crypto in a nascent market with little competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

The firm's core thesis is that crypto will facilitate the largest one-time shift in wealth in Internet history, driven by blockchain acting as a new, credible coordination mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

## Key Investment Principles
### Patience and Conviction
The hardest part of investing is not the buying or selling, but "the waiting for your thesis to play out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. Patience and conviction are both necessary to achieve exceptional returns, as these things take time for compounding to occur and for the market to align with one's view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

Developing patience requires practice, including making and honestly analyzing mistakes of impatience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. For example, Multicoin's investment in Solana, starting in 2018, initially felt difficult due to the network's incomplete functionality and lack of ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. Despite personal crises of confidence and thoughts of selling, a team decision-making structure helped maintain patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

### Managing Opportunity Cost
When facing the "everything is pumping except my coin" phenomenon, Jain employs the saying: "I don't need to be in everything that makes money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. He emphasizes focusing on areas where the firm has an edge and understanding investments intellectually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Missing out on meme coins or sector rotations is acceptable if they are not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. A few successful investments are sufficient over an economic cycle, rather than spreading oneself too thin trying to catch every opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

### Knowing When to Exit
The waiting game becomes too long if the initial investment thesis is invalidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. This requires brutal honesty, as it's easy to lie to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

## Ugly Truths in Crypto Investing
Only a handful of practical use cases for crypto exist, primarily around payments, trading, and capital formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. While other areas generate excitement, current data suggests they are not yet working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. Therefore, investors should focus on projects with a clear thesis and demonstrable product-market fit, rather than investing based on "vibes" or "pie in the sky" ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

## Mitigating Analysis Paralysis
To avoid [[managing_risk_and_making_informed_investment_decisions | paralysis by analysis]], Jain advises "dumbing it down" and seeking the simplest explanation, often referring to this as "going left" on the IQ chart meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. His default is to do nothing if he can't get excited about an investment, following the principle: "if it's not a hell yes, it's a no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.

## [[Volatility and speculative crypto investments | Handling Volatility and Losses]]
The crypto market is notoriously volatile, leading to significant paper gains and losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. Experiencing both extreme highs (e.g., 2021) and extreme lows (e.g., FTX collapse in 2022) teaches that "things are never as good as they seem and they're never as bad as they seem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.

### Lessons from Market Crashes
Past experiences, such as the 2018 and particularly the March 2020 COVID crash, were formative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>. During the COVID crash, a "painful mistake" of derisking taught Jain not to make significant portfolio changes during periods of extreme [[Investment strategies and managing risk in crypto | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. The key is to "just pause" and avoid being a forced buyer or seller, always aiming to trade on one's own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

### Psychological Tools
To manage the [[the_psychology_behind_crypto_investments | psychological impact]] of volatility and loss aversion bias, Jain employs several tactics:
*   **Zooming out**: Viewing current circumstances as a "movie of my life" helps create distance and understand the period of adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.
*   **Gratitude for bad feelings**: Recognizing that painful lows make the highs feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.
*   **Avoiding compulsive price checks**: Jain implemented a personal rule of doing 10 push-ups or squats if he checked the price without the intention to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. This stemmed from observing a wealthy individual compulsively refreshing prices for a dopamine hit, and the desire to avoid that behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>. He believes checking the price is only useful if it informs a trading decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.
*   **Diversifying identity**: Maintaining a "diversity of identities" beyond professional success (e.g., husband, father, friend, gardener) helps manage stress when one area faces challenges, akin to a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Founder Traits for Crypto Success
When identifying world-class crypto founders, Multicoin Capital looks for:
1.  **High Agency**: People who "find a way" to accomplish goals, even in difficult situations, and are not afraid to defy social norms or rules (e.g., college dropouts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.
2.  **Intellectual Honesty about Trade-offs**: Founders must acknowledge and articulate the downsides and costs of their approach, rather than claiming it is superior in every way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. This includes being honest about their own potential mistakes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

## Solana's Appeal
Multicoin Capital is significantly invested in the Solana ecosystem because it delivers what users primarily care about: cheap, fast, and easy transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. Its fast block times, low transaction costs, and single-chain, single-wallet experience make it user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. Solana's current inertia makes it difficult for newer chains to unseat it unless they are "significantly better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

Potential risks for Solana include unforeseen breakthroughs in zero-knowledge technology that could favor Layer 2 solutions, and regulatory challenges given Solana's US-based founding team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. The future is path-dependent, not inevitable, and unexpected "chaos" can derail progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

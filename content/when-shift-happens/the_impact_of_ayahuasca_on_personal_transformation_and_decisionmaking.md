Ayahuasca is described as a deeply spiritual journey, serving as a connection to the source of the universe, whether it's called God or Mother Nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>. It is a space where one perceives the "truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. The speaker, Rand Neer, states that every major decision he has made in the last 15 years has been influenced by guidance received during ayahuasca journeys, and all of these decisions have led to positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. Ayahuasca helps bring harmony to various aspects of life, including work and [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | personal relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

## How Ayahuasca Works
The process of an ayahuasca journey typically involves three stages: feeling, seeing, and then resolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>. It helps people resolve past issues and let go of old relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. The experience can be intensely painful, leading to crying and a desire for the journey to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. This intense physical and emotional purging, described as "purging emotion" and "purging dirt," is a key part of the process, helping to release lack of confidence and [[impact_of_mental_health_on_creativity_and_business | depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. After this difficult phase, participants can feel revitalized, re-energized, warm, and beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

## Specific Transformations Through Ayahuasca
Ayahuasca journeys are cited as directly influencing significant [[role_of_psychedelic_experiences_in_personal_transformation | personal transformation]] in several areas:

### Overcoming FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)
The speaker previously experienced severe FOMO, manifesting in constantly seeking better opportunities or experiences, such as visiting multiple parties in one night or chasing deals he didn't truly want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. During an ayahuasca journey, he felt this FOMO as an anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>. The experience took him back to age 6, identifying the root cause in childhood friendships where he felt excluded and feared being left out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. By understanding the source, ayahuasca "reprogrammed" his brain, effectively eliminating this FOMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. This change allows him to be content in one place without needing to constantly move or fear missing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

### Addressing Addictions
Despite not considering himself an addict, an ayahuasca journey revealed his addictions to Coke Zero, the "number go up" phenomenon in crypto (dopamine from being right), and even minor medication use (e.g., paracetamol for headaches, sleeping pills for travel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. The message received was that solving the Coke Zero addiction would address the core of all his other addictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. After the journey, he could no longer drink diet soft drinks due to a profound aversion to their metallic taste, a change that was immediate and lasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>. This shift also reduced his compulsion to check YouTube studio analytics and crypto prices by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>.

### Improving Personal Relationships
Ayahuasca provided a critical insight into his relationship with his eldest son, Benji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. He initially believed his son's emotional distance was a natural part of growing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. During a journey, he felt the same pain and depression his son was experiencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. Ayahuasca revealed that he was unintentionally hurting his son by prioritizing activities with his sportier younger brothers, causing Benji to protect himself by distancing himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. The solution was to spend one-on-one time with Benji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. After a four-day safari trip together, their relationship fully recovered, and his son now regularly cuddles with him again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. He states he could never have seen this issue without the clarity provided by ayahuasca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

### Influencing Career Decisions
Following a challenging period in the United States during a crypto bear market and COVID-19 lockdowns, where he lost confidence after two years of no business progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>, Rand returned to South Africa in a "black place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. An ayahuasca ceremony provided immediate guidance: "do Banter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. Crypto Banter was an idea he had previously discarded because it seemed like a linear business, not an exponential one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. Ayahuasca clarified that Banter would be his "platform to get into everybody else's exponential platforms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Starting Crypto Banter felt like the "easiest journey" of his life, with everything working smoothly, reinforcing the idea that the universe aligns when one is doing the "right thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

## Influence on Financial Decision-Making
An ayahuasca journey also addressed his deeply ingrained fear of spending money and his tendency to accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. This behavior stemmed from a subconscious lack of self-confidence that he could always recover financially if knocked down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. The message from ayahuasca was powerful: "live your life so hard that you die in debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This meant not holding onto assets when one dies, as there is no point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This guidance also ties into his fear of his children lacking "hunger" if left too much wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>, although he acknowledges the challenge of balancing this with parental provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. The insight is to enjoy every moment and spend responsibly, recognizing that the marginal utility of money decreases with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

## Overall Philosophy
Ayahuasca serves as a potent form of [[personal_growth_through_holistic_approaches_and_alternative_medicine | therapy]] for the speaker, offering "better value" than conventional therapy due to its natural and induced experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. The profundity of its impact reprograms the brain to see things differently, making it impossible to "unsee" or "unwind" new perspectives once gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. He believes the pain experienced during these journeys is a necessary purging of elements that hold one back in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>. While the speaker acknowledges the initial aversion to the pain, he asserts that anyone considering it should "just get off your ass and actually do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>, stating it's "the best thing you can ever do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.

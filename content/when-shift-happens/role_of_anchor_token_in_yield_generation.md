The Anchor Token, identified by the ANC ticker, plays a specific role within the [[mechanics_of_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] ecosystem, primarily concerning the borrowing side of [[Anchor Protocol staking and borrowing | Anchor Protocol staking and borrowing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## ANC as an Incentive and Offset Mechanism

ANC tokens are distributed to offset the borrow APR (Annual Percentage Rate) for users, aiming to create a net positive API (Annual Percentage Interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This means that, in some instances, users who put up collateral and borrow money on Anchor can actually be paid to borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

The ANC token helps the platform pay out yields to borrowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is done through the distribution of Anchor's governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The distribution of ANC tokens was established as an incentivization program, designed to encourage people to use the Anchor platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This token distribution is scheduled to conclude at the end of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

While the primary source of [[highyield_stablecoin_interest | highyield stablecoin interest]] for depositors on Anchor comes from the yield generated by staked collateral (bLuna and bETH) and the interest paid by borrowers, the ANC token's role is to make borrowing more attractive by effectively subsidizing borrow costs, sometimes even paying borrowers to take out loans. This incentivizes increased borrowing, which in turn provides more collateral for the protocol to stake and earn yield, contributing indirectly to the overall [[sustainability_of_anchor_protocol | sustainability of Anchor Protocol]].

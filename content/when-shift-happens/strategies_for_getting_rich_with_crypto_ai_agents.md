Jensen Tang, co-founder and CEO of Virtuals Protocol, a leading crypto AI agents protocol, offers insights into how individuals can potentially achieve wealth with crypto AI agents without relying on luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His company, Virtuals Protocol, provides an ecosystem where people can create and co-own autonomous agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Tang emphasizes a critical distinction for understanding how to get rich in crypto without getting lucky: the difference between high-value agents and commodity agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>.

## High-Value vs. Commodity Crypto AI Agents

### Commodity Agents
Commodity agents are those with "no mode or no value accrual mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:57">[01:35:57]</a>. They often target a strong problem statement but use "very commoditized functions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>.
For example, an agent whose sole purpose is to order food from a delivery service like DoorDash is considered a commodity agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. If an agent utilizes generic APIs that anyone can use, it will not create significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:06">[01:38:06]</a>.
**Key takeaway:** Don't invest in commodity agents, as they are unlikely to generate substantial wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a>.

### High-Value Agents
High-value agents possess a "moat" or an "edge" (advantage) that makes them difficult to replicate or disrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>. This edge can manifest in various forms:

*   **Model Edge:** The agent is trained through advanced models, like Federated learning, to understand user preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>.
*   **Data Edge:** The agent has access to proprietary information or data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>.
*   **Action Space Edge:** The agent's capabilities or actions in a specific domain give it a unique advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a>.

To create value, an agent needs to solve an actual pain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:24">[01:37:24]</a>. When launching an agent, it's crucial to think beyond simple tasks like "Twitter poster" or generic API usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>.

## Examples of High-Value Agents and Their "Edge"

### xbt (XBT)
XBT went viral and saw massive price action because it solved a common pain point: "what token do I buy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. The team behind XBT spent months building an "information creation pipeline," which was their crucial edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>. This specialized information, combined with an autonomous agent, created significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:49">[01:37:49]</a>.

### Sports Commentary Agent
A potential high-value agent could be a sports commentary agent that excels in a specific sport like basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>.
This agent would:
*   Be trained on proprietary information, such as advanced basketball analytics used by coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>.
*   Act as a sounding board for fans, answering complex questions about game strategies or player performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   Crucially, it could be linked to high-liquidity markets like sports betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:15">[01:40:15]</a>. The agent, acting as a distribution platform, could recommend bets and capture a flow of transactions, becoming a "cash flow agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:35">[01:40:35]</a>. Its edge would be its access to proprietary analytics and its ability to influence betting decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:49">[01:40:49]</a>.

### Internet Water Army
A more controversial but potentially lucrative use case involves autonomous agents forming an "internet water army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>.
*   This refers to a network of bots on social media that can be controlled to shape narratives, such as managing PR disasters by flooding platforms with positive content to drown out negative stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>.
*   Traditional bot accounts are easily identified and countered by platform systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:15">[01:43:15]</a>.
*   However, if autonomous agents can produce human-like content, continuously build follower accounts (like Luna, an AI influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:37">[01:43:37]</a>), and operate in large numbers, it becomes difficult to differentiate them from humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.
*   This capability represents an "insane marketing use case" or "narrative shaping use case" that could even be applied to elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:14">[01:44:14]</a>. The value capture would come from offering this as a service model to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>.

## Key Principles for Value Accrual
To succeed, agents need "non-commoditized capabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:37">[01:45:37]</a>. Avoid investing in agents that perform tasks easily replicated by general-purpose AI models, such as basic "Twitter posters" or agents that simply buy gifts from Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>. These do not "deserve a token" and are unlikely to make you rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a>.
**Key takeaway:** Invest in agents that are specialized and possess a unique edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:04">[01:46:04]</a>.

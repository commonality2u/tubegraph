Andre Cronje, a software developer and entrepreneur known for creating the [[andre_cronjes_crypto_project_challenges_and_regrets | Yearn Finance protocol]], frequently received emails and letters from the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These communications often stated, "we know everything. You need to now give us everything. We're going to compare and if it's wrong, you're going to end up in jail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Initial Encounters and Threats
Initially, Cronje believed that answering these requests would resolve the issues, but he quickly learned this was not the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. He inquired about the worst possible outcome if he didn't comply, and the SEC informed him that **extradition was "on the table"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. He chose not to test this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

At the time, Cronje was a South African living in South Africa, had not visited the US, and hadn't sold any tokens or provided services that he believed fell under US jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. Despite this, "double-digit emails" from the SEC requested information and turnovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

## Evolving Inquiries and Legal Support
The inquiries started "friendly enough" as requests for information under the guise of an "inquiry" that would become an "official investigation" if publicized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. However, they rapidly escalated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. Cronje likened the experience to dealing with tax agencies, where they claim to "know everything" and threaten jail if provided information is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

These sessions, numbering over ten, demanded "comprehensive" detail, often requiring information Cronje didn't possess, forcing him to seek alternative sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. The SEC's strategy involved "look[ing] for different angles to drill down," implying they asked questions until a mistake was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

Cronje was aided by attorneys Brown Rutnik and Gabe from Metall, who guided him through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

### Shifting Focus
Initially, the SEC's focus was on the **Yearn token (YFI)**, querying about investors, seed rounds, sales, and holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. Proving a negative, such as not holding any tokens, proved challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

As the SEC realized the token wasn't a viable "angle of attack," they shifted their focus to the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. They began to claim that the **Yearn vaults** were securities because users deposited money with the expectation of a return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This "scope creeping" continued until the next election cycle, when the inquiries subsided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

## Impact and Return to Crypto
The threat of extradition was particularly concerning for Cronje, who felt his home country of South Africa would readily "throw [him] to America for a banana" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.

The regulatory environment significantly influenced his past decisions. He stated that it was "practically illegal to launch a crypto company back then," with "no path to successfully do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. He is now only risking launching new projects like his exchange because there is "finally a path forward" with a "more positive administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

After stepping back from public crypto engagement around 2020-2021, which many assumed meant leaving crypto entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>, Cronje attempted to return to a traditional job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. However, he found that "once you've been in crypto, you can't get out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>, as he was still thinking about unresolved problems in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. He transitioned back to full-time crypto within two to three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>, but largely stayed off platforms like Twitter due to the "noise and toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. His recent return to public engagement was primarily to amplify news about Sonic, his new blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.

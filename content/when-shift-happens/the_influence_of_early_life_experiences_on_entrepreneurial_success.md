Chao Wang, a founding partner of Alliance DAO and founding head of product at Misari, shares his [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]] and insights into the qualities that contribute to a founder's success. His reflections often link back to his upbringing and the influence of his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Background and Family Influence

Wang grew up in Montreal and has always prioritized being close to his parents, a goal he achieved 15 years after graduating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. He describes his life as "pretty smooth" and feels lucky to have been born into a "great family" with "great parents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Although his family was not wealthy, objectively being in the bottom 20% of society in terms of income and living paycheck to paycheck on Canadian government social welfare programs for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>, his parents always promised to send him to university and pay for tuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

He emphasizes the [[the_importance_of_support_and_relationships_in_entrepreneurship | pivotal role of his wife]], whom he met in 2013-2014, in his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. He credits her understanding and financial and psychological support for allowing him to take significant risks in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

## Risk-Taking and Career Choices

Wang always possessed a strong "willingness to take risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, but his "ability to take risk" was initially limited by his family's financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Despite wanting to start a startup after college, concerns for his parents led him to take a "safe job" in Wall Street finance as a Quant Trader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This role, involving low-level distributed systems, inadvertently led to his interest in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:15]</a>.

His personal journey into crypto was sparked by the market's volatility in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a> and a frustrating experience where his entire net worth got stuck in the banking system for half a year while trying to arbitrage offshore betting platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. This incident solidified his realization of Bitcoin's value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

## Traits of Successful Founders

Wang looks for specific traits in founders:
*   **Contrarianism**: He believes the best founders, like the best investors, are "extremely contrarian" and question the consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>. Building a startup fundamentally involves uncovering a market or user insight that no one else understands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>.
*   **"High Degree of Autism"**: He controversially states that for consumer-facing product founders, "autism is almost a requirement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. He believes autistic individuals can think independently and contrarianly, unaffected by common consensus or internet chatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.
*   **Childhood Trauma**: While not a direct requirement, he observes that many highly persistent individuals have a "massive chip on their shoulder" and "early life trauma," which provides them with "something to prove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>. This trauma fuels the "action" aspect of success, while "autism" provides the "thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>.

## Perseverance and Growth

He notes that [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | perseverance]] is crucial in crypto, an industry characterized by boom and bust cycles, regulatory challenges, and high-profile failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Surviving bear markets requires a deep love for crypto and even a "love pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.

Wang believes that money can change people, observing that "overnight success" and wealth can alter decision-making, citing Do Kwon as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. He supports the idea that honesty and transparency about one's motivations, including the desire for money or to build a billion-dollar business, are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>.

## Personal Reflections on Money and Happiness

Wang suggests that his own happiness has increased monotonically with money, primarily because "money does remove a lot of stress out of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:07">[01:36:07]</a>. He is glad he focused on career and money in his 20s, which now allows him to enjoy the "beautiful parts of having kids" without the associated stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. He also notes a correlation between crypto people and interest in longevity, which he sees as intertwined with managing health and stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>.

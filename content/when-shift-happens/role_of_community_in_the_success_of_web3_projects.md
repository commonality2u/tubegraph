The success and longevity of Web3 ventures, particularly in the crypto space, are deeply intertwined with the strength and conviction of their communities. Unlike traditional businesses, the growth trajectory of successful crypto projects often follows a "staircase" pattern rather than a smooth, exponential curve, making dedicated communities essential for survival during lean times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

## Community as a Survival Mechanism

A critical mass of committed individuals is essential for the survival of any crypto network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This has been evident in the history of major blockchain projects:
*   **Bitcoin:** The [[building_a_decentralized_community_and_ecosystem | Bitcoin core community]]'s belief in the project was crucial for its survival during contentious periods, such as the SegWit drama in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Ethereum:** Following the DAO hack in 2016, which saw a significant percentage of ETH stolen, the [[the_role_of_community_in_crypto_businesses | Ethereum community]] split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Despite the turmoil and loss of conviction among many, a small group of passionate developers continued building on the network, ultimately ensuring its resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   **Solana:** The collapse of FTX presented a similar challenge to [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Solana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. However, a dedicated "small handful" of around 50 serious dApp developers and entrepreneurs remained passionate and committed, providing the conviction that [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Solana]] was "here to stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

## Passionate Users Drive Long-Term Growth

During "bare markets" when broader interest wanes, projects that survive and eventually thrive are those with a core group of "handful of users that really love their products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. These "power users" provide the critical feedback and sustained engagement that allows development to continue even without significant growth metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

### Examples of Community-Driven Growth
*   **Tensor:** This NFT marketplace endured a year or two of "no growth, no traction," with only about 50 power users consistently engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Their commitment to these users allowed them to "iterate on the product" and eventually reach "escape velocity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Farcaster:** This non-speculative product experienced a similar "staircase growth" pattern, being "flat for a very long time" before a sudden 10x user base increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

## The New Business Model: Community First

A significant shift in business building, especially in Web3, is the "community-first" approach. This model prioritizes establishing a strong community before developing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.

### NFT Communities and Product Development
NFT projects like Pudgy Penguins exemplify this new strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. They start by building a community around a digital asset (JPEG) and then evolve to develop physical products (toys at Walmart) and digital experiences (Pudgy World game) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. This "very counterintuitive" approach is becoming more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>.

This phenomenon extends beyond crypto, as seen with figures like Bryan Johnson, who built the "Don't Die Community" before selling products like supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>. The lower barrier to entry for building products, partly due to AI, makes a strong community a "valuable forever" asset for future product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.

## [[importance_of_community_building_and_web3_ventures_like_memeland | Meme Coins]] and Community Leaders

[[importance_of_community_building_and_web3_ventures_like_memeland | Meme coins]], a prominent subclass of crypto assets, also rely heavily on community dynamics. Key conditions for their early-stage success include a "cult leader" and a highly shareable, viral meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. The success of Dogwifhat ($WIF) is attributed to its "genius" of having a "hat" that could be easily added to any meme or profile picture, facilitating its virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. For a meme coin to sustain long-term, listing on major exchanges like Binance is also beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.

The [[importance_of_community_building_and_web3_ventures_like_memeland | Memeland]] community itself is described as having a "very high on autism" trait, indicating a deep, almost obsessive focus among its members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[the_role_of_community_in_crypto_businesses | role of community in crypto businesses]] is paramount. It provides the resilience needed to survive bear markets, fuels growth during periods of stagnation, and forms the foundational layer for new business models in the [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web3]] era. For founders and investors, understanding and valuing the presence of a passionate community is key to identifying projects with long-term potential.

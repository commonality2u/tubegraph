In the rapidly evolving landscape of social media and the crypto industry, digital marketing has transformed into a strategic and scientific endeavor. Jay Kurahashi, CMO at Ava Labs, shares insights from his journey and expertise, emphasizing the importance of understanding algorithms, storytelling, and community building in this dynamic environment.

## The Evolution of Marketing: From Intuition to Science

Jay Kurahashi's accidental foray into digital marketing began with running a music publication, where he organically garnered a million readers annually. This experience taught him that success in the digital realm wasn't just about posting content but understanding the underlying science of digital marketing and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:30">[02:50:30]</a>. This realization shifted his perspective from simply posting tweets or Facebook updates without real understanding to grasping the strategic channels involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>.

The contemporary approach to digital marketing in the era of social media leverages advanced tools. For instance, some podcasts use AI and data analysis to script questions, aiming for answers that are more likely to go viral in short video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:16">[02:29:16]</a>. This focus on optimizing content for algorithms is key to gaining eyeballs and securing sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:30">[02:29:30]</a>. As exemplified by figures like Mr. Beast, who claims he could start a new YouTube channel and reach 10 million subscribers in six months due to his understanding of what goes viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:12">[02:30:12]</a>, knowing "the science of going viral" is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:25">[02:30:25]</a>.

Marketing is fundamentally "professional storytelling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:58">[02:57:58]</a>. If the story doesn't resonate, the job isn't done. With thousands of potential channels, marketers must strategically play their pieces to ensure the story aligns with the target customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:04">[02:31:04]</a>.

## Marketing in the Crypto Space

The crypto industry, like music and other creative fields, involves nested social layers and significant marketing components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:30">[02:31:30]</a>. Jay's professional journey led him to become Head of Marketing for Fluidity in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>, and later CMO at Ava Labs, leading marketing for Avalanche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Strategic Marketing Initiatives at Ava Labs

Avalanche focuses its marketing efforts on three primary areas:
1.  **Enterprises**: Targeting businesses looking for blockchain solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:30">[03:41:30]</a>.
2.  **Ava Cloud**: A fully managed blockchain service allowing enterprises to deploy a blockchain solution in minutes without needing a full engineering team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>. Unlike third-party services, Ava Cloud is built by the same team that develops the Avalanche protocol, ensuring quicker integration and performance advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:30">[03:42:30]</a>.
3.  **Avassant**: An artist grants program focused on up-and-coming artists interested in blockchain technology but unsure how to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:58">[03:43:58]</a>. This program teaches a music curriculum from zero to advanced, aiming to help artists shape their direction using blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:06">[03:44:06]</a>. This collaborative spirit helps legitimize the project by showing that Ava Labs is willing to sponsor artists' dreams rather than just pursuing a quick cash grab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:46">[03:46:46]</a>.

### Leveraging Existing Networks and Validating Product Direction

Jay leverages his extensive contacts from the music industry to foster connections between artists and blockchain technology. He invites DJs to play at Avalanche events and explains how crypto, like NFTs, can benefit their artistic careers and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>. This approach focuses on presenting blockchain as a potential solution and working collaboratively with artists to adapt it to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:34">[03:16:34]</a>.

This direct engagement with potential users, such as artists, allows for early validation or invalidation of product direction before it's even public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:05">[03:17:05]</a>. This proactive information gathering helps make informed decisions, not just in product development but also in understanding the market for [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets | crypto investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:16">[03:17:16]</a>.

### Challenges and Ethical Considerations in Crypto Marketing

The crypto space often presents challenges due to its speculative nature, where "money is just numbers on the screen" and can feel like a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This disconnect can lead to reckless behavior, as seen in the "aping" phenomenon, where individuals jump into projects without thinking, hoping for quick gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a>. Such behavior often results in significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:24">[03:16:24]</a>.

> [!warning] Red Flag: Get-Rich-Quick Schemes
> If a crypto opportunity feels like a "get-rich-quick scheme," it's likely a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:39">[03:10:39]</a>. While tempting, such ventures can burn an artist's entire fanbase and set back their brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:45">[03:10:45]</a>. Many artists, like many investors, initially consider crypto for quick money but soon realize the need for deeper understanding beyond surface-level speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.

> [!info] The "High School" Analogy
> The crypto industry can be compared to high school, with its cliques, tribes, and sometimes petty, childish dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Marketers and participants must understand that much of what they see, especially on social media, can be manipulated, with likes and other metrics often being "BS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:25">[04:20:25]</a>. Social signaling online can differ significantly from authentic self-expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:47">[04:20:47]</a>.

To mitigate risks, it's crucial to "not take things face value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:23">[03:24:23]</a>. Even when an expert speaks, it's wise to step back, consider other perspectives, and gather information before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:55">[03:26:55]</a>. Understanding the "game" and its rules through consistency and hard work is key to building success, whether in business, [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets | investing]], or growing a following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Prioritization and Balance in a Demanding Industry

Working in crypto often means intense periods, especially during bull markets, which can lead to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:09">[03:07:09]</a>. Jay emphasizes the importance of balancing life, especially during bear markets, by seeking healthy dopamine and endorphins from sources other than crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.

Jay's personal [[Impact of technological advancements and market patterns on crypto investments | strategy]] for balance revolves around three pillars:
1.  **Sleep**: Considered the foundational pillar; if sleep isn't addressed, other priorities suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:13">[03:10:13]</a>.
2.  **Work (Marketing in Crypto)**: The primary income-generating focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:02">[03:04:02]</a>.
3.  **Creativity (Photography)**: Provides fulfillment and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:21">[03:06:21]</a>.
4.  **Relationships**: As an extrovert, Jay derives energy from intimate, platonic, and professional relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:58">[03:09:58]</a>.

These pillars operate as a "push and pull" system; when one area, like work, is intense, he must consciously pull back on the others to maintain overall balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:10">[03:10:10]</a>. While short-term sacrifices in creativity or relationships might be made during peak work periods, the goal is always to return to equilibrium to avoid long-term burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:20">[03:12:20]</a>. The cyclical nature of crypto markets (bull and bear) can even force a return to a more balanced life during downtimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:55">[03:07:55]</a>.

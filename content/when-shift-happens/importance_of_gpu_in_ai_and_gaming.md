A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized computer component designed for specific tasks, primarily graphical processing [00:22:24]. It is distinct from a Central Processing Unit (CPU), which handles the majority of a laptop's functions [00:22:06]. While a CPU is a general-purpose "workhorse" that can perform many functions, GPUs are built for very fast processing of particular calculations, making them indispensable in certain fields [00:22:16].

## GPUs in Gaming

Historically, GPUs were primarily used for gaming and watching movies, which is where they get their name: Graphics Processing Unit [00:22:30]. Gamers sought out laptops with GPUs to enhance their gaming experience due to the component's ability to handle complex graphical computations [00:23:04].

## GPUs in AI

At some point, it was discovered that GPUs are exceptionally well-suited for Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks [00:22:39]. They are effective for both developing and running AI applications, which led to their rapid rise in prominence [00:22:44]. The processing requirements for machine and deep learning applications are doubling every 3.4 months, equating to a 10x growth every 18 months and a 100x growth every three years [00:25:44]. This unprecedented demand in the history of compute means that GPUs are now considered the "lifeblood of AI" [00:25:51].

## GPU: The New Oil

The analogy of GPUs being the "new oil" highlights their immense value and the parallel growth trajectories of both resources [00:23:48]. While oil was historically a nuisance, its value skyrocketed with the invention of the automobile and the internal combustion engine, making it a crucial resource for transportation [00:23:57]. Similarly, GPUs, initially cool but not essential for gaming, became indispensable with the advent and expansion of AI [00:24:47]. This has positioned GPUs as one of the most valuable assets globally [00:24:55].

## The Compute Shortage and Decentralized Solutions

There is a significant shortage of compute power, specifically GPUs, to meet the ravenous demand of AI [00:25:12]. Major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft struggle to keep up, as building new data centers is both slow and costly [00:25:56].

This shortage has led to the emergence of decentralized networks. For example, IET operates as an "Airbnb of AI," aggregating underutilized computing resources worldwide into a single platform [00:26:09]. This includes thousands of independent data centers operating at low capacity (12-18%) in the U.S. alone, and millions of consumer devices (laptops, PCs, gaming rigs) with GPUs that are barely used to their full potential [00:26:21].

This aggregation creates numerous benefits for consumers:
*   Access to virtually unlimited computing power [00:26:43]
*   Almost infinite scalability [00:26:48]
*   Censorship resistance [00:26:48]
*   Better performance [00:26:50]
*   Significantly lower costs: Decentralized networks like IET can be up to 10 times cheaper than centralized alternatives [00:26:55].

The belief is that [[the_role_of_crypto_in_ai_development | AI needs crypto]], specifically decentralized networks, to address this compute shortage and manage a future world with trillions of [[the_intersection_of_crypto_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] operating on billions of devices [00:27:51]. This permissionless environment is seen as impossible to orchestrate without a decentralized network [00:29:02]. This vision is part of the larger [[future_of_ai_and_its_intersection_with_crypto | future of AI and its intersection with crypto]], impacting everything from agriculture to healthcare and transportation [00:20:15].

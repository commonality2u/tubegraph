Kane War, co-founder and CEO of Infinex, describes the current state of the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry as "deeply unsatisfying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Despite significant effort in building the infrastructure, the technology is not being widely used beyond enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. War argues that the industry is stuck with the wrong incentives, pushing in the wrong direction, which has prevented mainstream adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Misaligned Incentives in DeFi

War, who admits to helping create many of the "dumb ideas" that keep the industry trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, feels an obligation to fix these mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. He emphasizes that early DeFi, while necessary for bootstrapping, developed strategies that were "directionally wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The focus has been on addressing the existing enthusiast audience repeatedly, due to bad incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This has led to a situation where the industry is a "giant circle jerk" and not progressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

A core issue is the incentive structure where individuals, including founders, tend to prioritize self-interest over the broader vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>. Many founders who have made substantial money lack the incentive to return and undertake the demanding work required to fix the underlying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

## Broken Market Structure

War describes the current market structure as an "inadequate equilibrium" â€“ a concept where a system can move into a detrimental state due to its incentive structure, becoming a "prison" from which existing players cannot escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. Breaking out requires someone with significant power or a different perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.

The venture capital (VC) and fundraising model in crypto illustrates this broken structure:
*   **Undervalued Seed Rounds**: Projects are compelled to raise seed rounds at very low valuations (e.g., $50 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>, even if the project is strong. Investors won't accept higher valuations because they expect the cheaper entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.
*   **Limited Participation**: These early rounds have limited capacity, often with hundreds of millions in bids for only a few million dollars, leading to a small number of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
*   **Forced Subsequent Rounds**: Projects, despite having sufficient funds, are forced to return to the market for Series A rounds months later, as they can't command higher valuations initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.
*   **Massive Price Discrepancy at TGE**: The token generation event (TGE) might see a project valued at $5 billion, an "orders of magnitude" increase from its seed round valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. This means only a small group of early investors benefit from the initial price discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.
*   **"Down Only" Market**: Tokens then often experience a continuous decline until retail investors capitulate, as they are forced to buy at inflated TGE prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Constraints**: Regulatory hurdles restrict token sales to a limited number of individuals, exacerbating the exclusivity of early access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

## The Evolution of Token Incentives: From Fixed Supply to Points Meta

War recounts how the assumption of a fixed token supply, influenced by ERC-20 defaults and Bitcoin maximalism, was a "dumb" idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. He realized that a project's ownership of the network is fixed at 100%, regardless of the number of tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. This led to the concept of hyperinflationary tokens, paying participants in newly minted tokens to incentivize actions, which catalyzed the "Renaissance of yield farming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

The current "points meta" is seen as a clever, but ultimately flawed, workaround for the broken market structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. Projects create points, not tokens, to engage users and eventually give them access to future tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. However, this system quickly spirals out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>, leading to:
*   Disillusioned users who farm for ages believing in high APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.
*   A psychological trap where tokens, having an "effectively zero" cost basis (due to opportunity cost, not purchase price), are mercilessly dumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
*   This creates a "perverse incentive" for people to farm and dump, while those who genuinely care about the project receive minimal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

War believes the solution is simple: "let people buy tokens" with existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>. He argues that opposition to this solution often stems from a desire for control rather than valid reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.

## Infinex as a Solution

Infinex aims to address these issues by providing a "better way to do crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. It seeks to create a game-like points scheme that grants participants access to buying tokens, ensuring that only those who genuinely understand and participate are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. This approach is intended to move beyond the current broken incentive models.

War's ultimate goal for Infinex is for it to become the go-to platform for new users entering crypto, where they can confidently store, use, and trade assets without the risks associated with centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. He believes that the industry needs to evolve past these [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | challenges and risks in the crypto ecosystem]] to achieve mass adoption.

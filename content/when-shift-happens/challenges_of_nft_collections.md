Building and maintaining NFT collections presents a unique set of [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_launching_nfts_and_crypto_projects | challenges]] in the evolving Web3 space. The inherent nature of many NFT projects, especially during bull markets, often relies on speculation rather than underlying value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

## Financial and Market Challenges

### Maintaining Valuation
It is easy to fundraise in crypto, but difficult to maintain the initial valuation of an NFT collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. Full Diluted Valuations (FDVs) are not always reflective of the actual market cap, and there are not enough consumers for all niche products to reach high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Royalty Fluctuations
The anti-royalty movement, exemplified by marketplaces like X2Y2, significantly impacted the revenue model for NFT projects, as royalties were a primary source of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

### Market Dependency
NFT collections are highly susceptible to market conditions. Projects that saw high valuations in 2022 experienced significant declines, with the market tanking and many collections never recovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. The speculative nature of NFT mints, often seen as a "cook" or lottery ticket, means profitability is not guaranteed and can disappear quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

### Treasury Management and Incentives
A significant [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | challenge]] lies in aligning founders' and investors' interests. Founders sometimes try to defend the floor price of tokens by using raised funds to buy tokens from the open market, a strategy that often fails as people will find ways to dump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. The potential for team token unlocks to lead to dumping is also a concern for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

## Operational and Strategic Challenges

### Lack of Clear Business Models
Many early NFT projects, particularly during the 2021-2022 boom, launched without a clear business model beyond selling NFTs. This led to a realization that constantly launching new collections or relying solely on royalties was unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

### Dependence on Web2 Integration
To achieve substantial revenue and growth, NFT projects often need to integrate with Web2 audiences and businesses. Relying solely on Web3 personal for sales (e.g., toys, merchandise) limits potential revenue significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

### Consulting and Control Issues
For consulting firms in the Web3 space, a major [[challenges_in_the_crypto_industry | challenge]] is the inability to control the actions of the teams they advise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. Even if a consultant helps a project go viral or mint out, they cannot guarantee the team's long-term execution or business understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

### Project Failure and Accountability
When a product or its token fails, the responsibility often falls heavily on the larger entity that backed it, even if the failure was due to an independent team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>. Token performance and product success are not always correlated, leading to frustration when a technically sound product has a poorly performing token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

### Transparency and Accountability
A [[challenges_and_perspectives_in_the_crypto_industry | challenge]] in crypto is the lack of transparency regarding founders' salaries and the use of raised funds. Some founders take large salaries without accountability, leading to funds being burned and projects shutting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>.

## Reputational and Community Challenges

### Dealing with FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)
Founders in Web3 face direct and personal attacks, including DMs, LinkedIn messages, and social media harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Initial reactions to FUD can be intense, but experience teaches founders to differentiate between baseless FUD and constructive criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Sharing frustrations within a trusted team can help manage this stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Personal Attacks and Stereotypes
Some founders face racial slurs and stereotypes, such as being called an "Indian brown scammer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This personal bias adds an extra layer of [[challenges_of_building_in_the_web3_space | challenge]], making it important for the community to look at a team's actions and track record rather than their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

### Maintaining Community Trust
When projects fail or tokens don't perform, community members often blame the founders, leading to resentment even if the founders had good intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.

## Broader Industry Challenges
The [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_ecosystem_challenges | crypto ecosystem]] is constantly shifting metas (e.g., memecoins to DeFi), requiring projects to be fluid and adaptable. Success depends on resilience and the willingness to pivot when strategies are not working, rather than adhering to an egoistic vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

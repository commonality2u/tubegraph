Arthur Brightman's [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]] began in traditional finance, specifically in machine learning and statistics for finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">01:09:56</a>. He worked in statistical arbitrage, identifying statistical patterns in price discrepancies to profit from them in public markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">00:32:55</a>. This was often automated, ranging from low-frequency strategies (e.g., rebalancing portfolios quarterly based on indicators like low P/E) to high-frequency trading (day-long, minute-long, or even micro-second long horizons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">00:33:17</a>. He worked in this field from around 2004 (internships) to 2016 (full-time from 2007) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">00:34:04</a>.

## Transition to Crypto and Founding Tezos

Brightman's transition from traditional finance to crypto was not direct. Crypto initially started as a hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>. He began working on Tezos in 2014, viewing it as an intellectual challenge to explore topics like smart contracts and Proof of Stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">00:35:33</a>. He considered it an "option," believing that even if it amounted to nothing, he would learn something interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">00:36:06</a>.

In 2016, he moved from traditional finance to robotics, working for Waymo (Alphabet's self-driving car division, then part of Google X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">00:34:58</a>. However, his crypto hobby gained significant traction in 2016-2017, growing "huge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>.

Brightman's wife became more involved with Tezos full-time in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">00:36:28</a>. While co-founding a company with a life partner poses risks, the benefit of deeply knowing and being compatible with the other person is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">00:36:52</a>.

### The 2017 Tezos ICO and Subsequent Challenges

In July 2017, the Tezos Foundation raised $232 million (in Bitcoin and Ether) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">00:42:46</a>. Despite this massive success, Brightman continued working his full-time job in robotics until August 2017, indicating his strong interest in that field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">00:38:12</a>. The initial structure involved selling the company and IP to an external foundation, allowing the project to have its own life while he focused on robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">00:39:08</a>.

The Tezos ICO was not "pre-programmed" for success like some industries; timing was a big factor, and the idea resonated due to prevailing stresses in the Ethereum community regarding governance and smart contract security, which Tezos's 2014 paper had addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">00:40:47</a>. The ability to contribute with Bitcoin from an exchange, unlike other projects, also made a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">00:41:19</a>.

Despite the successful fundraising, the Tezos project faced extreme [[challenges_and_solutions_in_entrepreneurship | challenges and responsibilities in financial investment and entrepreneurship]] immediately after. Brightman describes 2017 as a period where "everything... every problem" was thrown at them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">00:36:47</a>. These included:
*   Six personal lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">00:37:36</a>.
*   A "psychopath" in Switzerland attempting to bankrupt them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">00:37:39</a>.
*   Board failures, including a director ignoring legal advice to fire the problematic individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">00:44:54</a>.
*   Lawyer malpractice in Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">00:45:17</a>.
*   Constant public slander in the press for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">00:37:55</a>. The extensive transparency surrounding Tezos made it an easy target for "lazy wire reporters" seeking an ICO scandal story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">00:45:41</a>.

During this storm, focusing on Tezos's future was difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">00:49:09</a>. The price swings in crypto did not affect Brightman as much as the public slandering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">00:46:50</a>. He coped by taking things "one step at a time" and briefly used anxiolytics prescribed by a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">00:47:49</a>. He found moderate positive effects from therapy over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">00:48:48</a>.

## Reflections on Entrepreneurship and Life

Brightman views his overall [[personal_reflections_on_entrepreneurship_and_mindset | personal reflections on entrepreneurship and mindset]] and life as generally happy and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">00:49:13</a>. His advice to his 19-year-old self would be to "take more risk early on in your 20s" because the opportunity cost is much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">01:07:50</a>. Even if an [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_overcoming_industry_challenges | entrepreneurial journey and overcoming industry challenges]] attempt fails after three or four years, one only loses the compensation of a junior employee and gains valuable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">01:08:22</a>. He emphasizes the high option value of trying, assuming one can afford it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">01:08:38</a>.

### Ethical Considerations in Business

Brightman acknowledges that crypto attracts unethical people due to the "prospect of easy money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">01:05:47</a>. He cites the example of Sam Bankman-Fried as a case where someone thought they could gain an edge by acting deontologically, but ultimately failed because the fraud was not sophisticated enough to avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">01:07:02</a>.

While he believes it's possible to be very successful and act morally in business, he states that the idea that "morality is always in your advantage" and that unethical actions are always business mistakes is hard to believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">01:03:15</a>. He doesn't believe in karma but suggests that moral preferences (like not betraying people) serve an evolutionary purpose, simplifying decision-making and preventing a bad reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">01:03:40</a>. People who try to act unethically for advantage are likely "fooling themselves" and will "hurt themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">01:05:18</a>. However, he also finds it "fantastically unlikely that the best possible course of action in business would be to be always 100% ethical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">01:05:24</a>.

Brightman concludes his [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | mindset and personal growth in entrepreneurship]] advice with: "Don't be a *want* entrepreneur, be an entrepreneur or not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">01:09:14</a>.

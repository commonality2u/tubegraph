Astroport is a new decentralized exchange (DEX) functioning as a trustless automated market maker (AMM) designed for the [[Introduction to Terra and Stablecoins | Terra ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It aims to offer significant improvements over existing AMMs and DEXs within the [[Introduction to Terra and Stablecoins | Terra ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Key Features and Improvements

Astroport is set to bring substantial enhancements to the [[Introduction to Terra and Stablecoins | Terra ecosystem]], including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>:
*   **Multiple Pool Types**
    *   Support for constant product pool types and stable swap pools within a single protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This allows for better pricing and improved trade efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Advanced Analytics**
    *   Provides advanced charting and analytics for liquidity provider (LP) positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Dual Token Rewards**
    *   Offers dual token rewards for LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Both liquidity providers and ASTRO stakers will share the platform's trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Tiered Governance**
    *   Introduces tiers of governance where the governance token can be kept liquid or locked, with locking amplifying voting rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Standard DEX Functionality**
    *   In addition to these new features, Astroport will include core DEX functionalities such as slippage controls, multi-hop routing, price impact previews, and exchange rate and fee calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Ecosystem Impact and Interoperability

Astroport aims to become a foundational pillar of the [[Introduction to Terra and Stablecoins | Terra ecosystem]], similar to how [[Comparison between Astroport and Uniswap | Uniswap]] functions within the Ethereum ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Built on Cosmos SDK
Astroport is built on the Cosmos SDK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This foundation means it can be integrated with Wormhole V2 and other [[interoperability_and_integration_of_astroport | interoperability protocols]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This capability is expected to expand Astroport's reach across the blockchain ecosystem, allowing for [[interoperability_and_integration_of_astroport | interoperability]] with various other platforms, protocols, and blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The growth of new projects in the [[Introduction to Terra and Stablecoins | Terra ecosystem]] is likened to Ethereum's growth over several years, but compressed into months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Tokenomics and Launch Mechanisms

Astroport will not be owned by a single entity, but by ASTRO token holders across the [[Introduction to Terra and Stablecoins | Terra ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
At launch, 110 million ASTRO governance tokens out of a total supply of one billion will be in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. These tokens are distributed through three main methods, detailed further in [[astroports_tokenomics_and_launch_details | Astroport's Tokenomics and Launch Details]]:
*   The [[Astroport airdrop and lock drop methods | airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   Phase one lock drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   Phase two ASTRO-UST bootstrapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>

### ASTRO Generators
Astroport features "ASTRO Generators" designed to distribute dual rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This means that, similar to some other protocols, users might earn yield in kind along with a supplementary yield in a governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Some projects may choose to award third-party governance tokens (e.g., [[Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of Terra Network | Anchor Protocol]] or Mirror) to liquidity locked in Astroport's lock drop, if they utilize Astroport's ASTRO Generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX and current CIO at Malstrom Fund, is a prominent macroeconomics writer who frequently shares his views on [[global_macroeconomic_views_and_societal_reset_predictions | global macroeconomic trends]] and their implications for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His analysis suggests an impending "societal reset" driven by a culmination of economic policies and societal shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## The Global Adoption of Keynesian Economic Theory

Hayes posits that the world has largely adopted Keynesian economic theory, which suggests that governments can solve economic problems by spending money to fill gaps in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. This approach has been universally applied across various nations including the United States, England, Western Europe, China, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

### Consequences of Accumulated Debt and Intervention

Since World War II, global economies have accumulated massive amounts of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. The continuous application of Keynesian principles has led to governments and central banks repeatedly intervening to save the banking system and eliminate the business cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[0:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[0:23:20]</a>. This has resulted in the manipulation of nearly every market within the Fiat financial system, with only government bond markets remaining somewhat free due to their immense size and difficulty to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[0:23:32]</a>.

Furthermore, declining productivity, political decisions moving away from hydrocarbons leading to increased energy costs, and reduced global integration contribute to rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[0:23:53]</a>. Countries are increasingly demanding to develop value-added products domestically rather than just exporting raw materials, further driving up costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[0:24:05]</a>.

## Understanding Inflation: Asset vs. Consumer Prices

Hayes distinguishes between two types of inflation:
*   **Asset Price Inflation:** This has been ongoing for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[0:24:52]</a>.
*   **Consumer Price Inflation:** This type of inflation, particularly in food and rent, directly impacts the common person and leads to significant public discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[0:24:55]</a>.

Governments face a dilemma: they must combat inflation by restraining credit growth and reducing economic activity, which conflicts with their massive debt obligations and promises (e.g., healthcare, education, defense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[0:25:09]</a>. Since raising taxes is unpopular, politicians are likely to choose money printing to fulfill their commitments and secure re-election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[0:27:51]</a>.

## The Impending Societal Reset

Hayes predicts a "societal reset," possibly not as severe as the Great Depression or World Wars, but heading in a similar direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[0:28:05]</a>. This reset is driven by the unsustainability of the massive sovereign debt market, which he believes is almost uncontrollable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[0:28:18]</a>.

### Regional Outlooks
*   **Japan:** Is seen as lighting the match due to its extreme money printing and government bond dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[0:28:50]</a>.
*   **China:** The fire is expected to burn brightest here, influenced by Japan's choices as competing export powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[0:29:02]</a>.
*   **United States:** Expected to be relatively stable due to its ability to feed itself, sufficient energy resources, population growth, and secure borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[0:29:07]</a>.
*   **Europe:** Predicted to face significant challenges, with potential for conflict if countries disagree on unity or separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[0:29:14]</a>.

Hayes suggests that in such an environment, individuals should prioritize basic needs like having a house and a reliable food supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[0:29:38]</a>.

## The Stealth Financial Crisis

During 2020-2021, banks globally received significant deposits due to COVID-19 stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[0:30:22]</a>. Regulators encouraged banks to buy government debt, as it was considered "profitable" under accounting rules and didn't count against capital requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[0:30:35]</a>. This led banks to buy massive amounts of government debt at historically low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[0:31:19]</a>.

When inflation emerged and central banks raised interest rates, bond yields increased, and bond prices fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[0:31:29]</a>. This rendered the entire world banking system, and indeed the broader [[understanding_money_and_economic_systems | Fiat Financial system]] (including pension funds and insurance), essentially insolvent if proper accounting and valuation were applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[0:31:54]</a>. The current challenge is a political one: determining who will bear the cost of bailing out the financial services sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[0:32:05]</a>.

## Future Prospects for Crypto

Hayes believes that either scenario—lowering interest rates to help the financial system or continuing to raise rates leading to insolvencies and subsequent money printing bailouts—is beneficial for [[Bitcoin valuation and future predictions | Bitcoin]] and [[cryptocurrency_market_trends_and_predictions | risk assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[0:32:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[0:32:55]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of patience and constructing a portfolio with asymmetric returns on the upside, enabling individuals to remain invested long enough to benefit from future bull markets, aligning with the [[market_cycles_and_price_predictions | market cycles]] observed in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[0:33:17]</a>. This outlook underscores the belief in the strong [[future_prospects_and_trends_in_the_crypto_market | future prospects and trends in the crypto market]] regardless of the path central banks choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[0:33:17]</a>.

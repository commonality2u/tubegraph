Yield Labs announced the launch of Nexus Protocol's V1 Vaults, aiming to address the issue of liquidations in the crypto space, particularly during bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The protocol's V1 iteration of vaults was opened to the Terra Money community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Nexus Protocol's Core Problem Solving
Nexus Protocol seeks to solve the real-world problem of liquidations, which can lead to significant impacts on portfolios, especially when market conditions encourage high leverage and a false sense of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A sequence of events earlier in the year caused massive liquidations in the [[understanding_anchor_protocol_and_its_liquidations | Anchor Protocol]], impacting the LUNA price and causing UST to lose its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The protocol implements vaults designed for yield optimization, enabling users to operate with a higher Total Value Locked (TVL) or collateral position than typically comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This is possible because the Nexus Protocol oracle [[mechanics_of_anchor_protocol | front-runs the Anchor Protocol oracle]], providing quicker, up-to-date pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This allows for background optimization of yields and loan-to-value rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> and can create arbitrage opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Accessing Nexus Protocol
The official website for Nexus Protocol is `nexusprotocol.app` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Their Twitter handle is `@nexusprotocol` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The whitepaper can also be found on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Upon connecting to the web app, users can view:
*   The current price of PSI, the [[governance_and_decisionmaking_on_nexus_protocol | governance]] token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   The total value locked (TVL) in the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Circulating supply details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Available Vaults and Tokens
The V1 Vaults currently support bLuna (bonded Luna) and bETH (bonded ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Both bLuna and bETH originate from [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, and can be used across the Terra ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Obtaining bETH for Nexus Vaults
One method to acquire bETH is by purchasing it on TerraSwap, which bypasses the need to deposit into [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] and avoids associated lock-up periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
To deposit bETH into a Nexus vault:
1.  Acquire bETH, for example, by swapping UST for bETH on TerraSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Transaction fees for swaps are very low (e.g., $1.53 for a $5200 swap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the bETH vault on the Nexus Protocol app and select "deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
3.  Depositing bETH into the vault mints an equivalent amount of nETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## [[using_liquidity_pools_and_yield_farms_on_nexus_protocol | Liquidity Pools]] and Yield Farms
Nexus Protocol features a "farm" tab with three [[using_liquidity_pools_and_yield_farms_on_nexus_protocol | liquidity pools]]:
*   PSI-UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   nLuna-PSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   nETH-PSI (offering the highest APR at launch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>

To participate in a [[using_liquidity_pools_and_yield_farms_on_nexus_protocol | liquidity pool]], such as the nETH-PSI pool:
1.  Ensure you have nETH (obtained by depositing bETH into the vault) and PSI tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
2.  On the farm page, select the desired pool (e.g., nETH-PSI) and click "farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  Deposit nETH and PSI in a 50/50 dollar value proportion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Transaction fees are notably low (e.g., 23 cents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

After depositing, users can see their staked assets and the accrued PSI rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. For instance, a stake of 1.1 nETH and 12.93k PSI tokens yielded 477% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. A potential strategy is to split earned PSI and re-invest it back into the LP pool to increase exposure to high APR rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. While high APRs incentivize liquidity, the PSI-UST pool has historically remained around 250% APR since the Token Generation Event (TGE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Withdrawing Liquidity
To withdraw assets from a [[using_liquidity_pools_and_yield_farms_on_nexus_protocol | liquidity pool]]:
1.  Go to the "withdraw" option on the farm page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
2.  Select the desired amount and confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
3.  After withdrawing from the pool, users can then withdraw their bETH from the Nexus vault back into their wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This bETH can then be sold for UST or used to repay loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## [[governance_and_decisionmaking_on_nexus_protocol | Governance]] and PSI Staking
Staking the Nexus [[governance_and_decisionmaking_on_nexus_protocol | governance]] token (PSI) is planned for the near future, with APRs to be published later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. As a [[governance_and_decisionmaking_on_nexus_protocol | governance]] token holder, users will have the ability to vote on platform decisions, including changes to vaults, additional [[using_liquidity_pools_and_yield_farms_on_nexus_protocol | liquidity pools]], and other proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Pudgy Penguins, one of the largest NFT communities, is exploring new avenues for growth, including the potential launch of a [[exploring_meme_coins_and_their_market_dynamics | meme coin]] and strategic ventures into Layer 2 (L2) solutions on Ethereum. Luca Netz, the owner of Pudgy Penguins, alongside Meow, co-founder of Jupiter Exchange, discussed the future of money, wealth, and communities, emphasizing that the community is the core business rather than just the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Community as the Business and Marketing Strategy
Netz highlights that for Pudgy Penguins, the physical toys are a marketing tool for the community, not the primary business objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The intention was never to sell toys in Web3 and crypto, as that was already a successful venture with his previous company, Jail Blaster, generating $100 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Instead, the focus is on fostering a strong community.

The "Web3 side" of Pudgy Penguins operates as a significant "loss leader" financially, meaning it requires substantial investment without direct immediate returns from royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. However, this investment is crucial because it serves as the "nucleus" for all other revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The belief is that by taking care of holders, value will be reciprocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Pudgy Penguins' valuation, reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, is driven by its revenue potential derived from community engagement, rather than solely its intellectual property (IP) earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Meow of Jupiter Exchange echoes this sentiment, stating that the product serves as marketing to attract and grow the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. They believe the product itself should embody their ethos, showing commitment to users even when things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## The PENGU Meme Coin and Expansion
Currently, Pudgy Penguins boasts approximately 20,000 unique "army members" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Netz envisions expanding this to 500,000 holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This ambition fuels the consideration of a [[exploring_meme_coins_and_their_market_dynamics | PENGU meme coin]].

There's a "Pangu prophecy" which claims that the [[exploring_meme_coins_and_their_market_dynamics | PENGU meme coin]] has the potential to become larger than any other [[exploring_meme_coins_and_their_market_dynamics | meme coin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Netz initially resisted the idea of a token, having promised his community he wouldn't go that route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. However, he now finds himself "increasingly bullish" on a PENGU token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

One key frustration for Netz in the NFT space is the lack of direct reward for the community from major announcements. For example, a significant partnership with Walmart, which placed Pudgy Penguins products prominently in stores, led to a 5% decrease in NFT value on the day of the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. He believes that if it were a token, the price would have increased, rewarding holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. A liquid token is seen as a solution to this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

Netz states that his job is to prioritize holders and liquidity. He ensures Pudgy Penguins is integrated with every Automated Market Maker (AMM) pool and infrastructure to unlock liquidity levers, which are essential for driving price, especially with illiquid assets like NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

## L2 Strategy and Consumer Experience
Pudgy Penguins currently has two products built on L2s:
*   **Pudgy World**: This product, built on ZkSync, allows users to buy a physical toy, scan a QR code, and redeem NFTs to enter a Web3 game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
*   **Overpass**: Powered by Polygon, this platform facilitates on-chain licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

Netz believes Pudgy Penguins brings more value to L2s than they bring to him, even with offers of $10-20 million to build on their ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. He observed a significant gap in the EVM ecosystem for chains specifically optimized for the consumer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. His goal with "Abstract" (likely the name of their new L2 venture) is to create crypto's "digital Disneyland" and the internet's next amusement park, hyper-focused on fun and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

He aims for 5 million monthly active users by prioritizing fun, even advising DeFi builders to deploy on other chains like Arbitrum if their focus isn't aligned with "fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. This consumer-centric approach means prioritizing the user above all else, which is "unorthodox" for most chains that prioritize decentralization or block integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

Netz sees Base as the primary competitor in the L2 space, praising its unparalleled execution and operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. He believes Base is worth more than Optimism and that if it had a token, it would be a top three chain token alongside Solana and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. However, he notes Base's "Achilles heels" are its challenges with crypto-native appeal and international adoption due to its Coinbase affiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. Tokens launched on Base might face handicaps if they cannot get listed on major international exchanges like Binance or OKX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

## Tokens, Liabilities, and Community Alignment
While there are successful projects like PolyMarket and Pump.fun that generate revenue without a token, Netz believes a token is vital for a community-driven business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. He argues that a token is the only way to uniquely align community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. Meow agrees, highlighting that launching a token can be "extremely distracting" for product focus unless it's synergistic with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. Jupiter delayed its token launch for three to four years, focusing on building trust and proving their product first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

Netz, however, is cautious about creating stablecoins, viewing them as significant liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

### Key Elements for Building a Strong Community
Luca Netz identifies three key elements:
1.  **Communication**: The most crucial aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.
2.  **Transparency**: Important for building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.
3.  **Empathy**: Understanding and validating community concerns, even if they seem trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

Meow adds:
1.  **Sincerity/Genuine**: Essential for authentic connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
2.  **Tactfulness**: Important for navigating communications effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.
3.  **Empathy**: Crucial for founders who often over-prioritize economics or technicalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

Both agree that a community's belief that founders are "in it with them" and "not extracting" is the fundamental basis for goodwill and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>.

The [[ethereum_and_smart_contracts | Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)]] is widely adopted in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with an estimated 80% to 90% of current developers in crypto being EVM developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Despite its pervasive use, the EVM was not initially built with performance in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, which has led to significant [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_ecosystem_challenges | performance challenges]] and limitations for [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] and other blockchains utilizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Historical Context and Core Issues

When [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] was first conceived, its primary innovation was the introduction of a general-purpose virtual machine, a concept not widely recognized at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The focus was on achieving a functional virtual machine, not on optimizing for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Over time, the EVM has grown to become a canonical place for transaction submission, both on [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] and other blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

The lack of initial performance consideration has resulted in several critical issues:
*   **High Transaction Costs:** Submitting a transaction on [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] can frequently cost as much as $100 in gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, making the platform largely inaccessible to normal users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Scalability Limitations:** [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]]'s Layer 1 (L1) infrastructure, particularly the EVM, is not currently equipped to handle the transaction volume required for future widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.
*   **Inability to Adapt:** Moving away from a widely adopted virtual machine like the EVM is "incredibly difficult" once it has gained significant traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## The Push for Performance: Parallelized EVMs

The recognition of these limitations has spurred innovation aimed at scaling the EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Projects like Say Protocol are developing solutions, such as the first parallelized EVM, to address the fundamental issue of poor EVM performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Parallelization is a technique that allows multiple independent transactions to be processed simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. This means if two transactions, for example, sending Ether from person A to person B and from person C to person D, do not touch overlapping "state" (i.e., they are completely separate), they can be run at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. This significantly accelerates transaction execution, leveraging modern hardware with multiple cores to process more transactions per second (TPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

The development of parallelized EVMs is expected to drive significant innovation in blockchain performance through 2024 and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. This trend is inevitable because users desire "cheap fees" and "fast infrastructure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. The shift towards higher performance blockchains, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, is seen as a "no-brainer" compared to those offering only 50 TPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a>.

## Impact on the Ecosystem

While [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] currently hosts the majority of activity, including Total Value Locked (TVL) and user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:18">[01:35:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>, its reliance on a non-performance-centric EVM presents a significant challenge. If [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]]'s L1 cannot scale to meet future demands, new infrastructure will be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

Projects that prioritize performance, such as Say Protocol with its parallelized EVM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> and [[comparison_of_ethereum_with_other_blockchain_platforms | Solana]] with its current speed, are seen as crucial for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>. The market feedback strongly indicates that developers prefer to build on platforms that support the EVM due to its current dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. This suggests that EVM-compatible solutions with enhanced performance will gain significant traction.

Over the next 12 months, the industry is expected to see a rise in execution clients and infrastructure supporting higher performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>. Legacy execution environments, such as a "vanilla EVM," are likely to become less common and relevant, while projects unwilling to adapt to these performance improvements may see reduced activity and traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>.

## Conclusion

The performance challenges inherent in the original design of the [[ethereum_and_smart_contracts | Ethereum Virtual Machine]] have necessitated a new wave of innovation. The development and adoption of parallelized EVMs and other high-throughput solutions are critical for scaling the blockchain ecosystem. While [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] maintains a strong position due to its existing network effects and a strategy that may involve [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | Layer 2 solutions]] for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:28">[01:35:28]</a>, the overall trend points towards a future dominated by faster, more efficient chains to meet growing demand and overcome the limitations of early blockchain designs.

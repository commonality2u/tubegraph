Memes have become a pervasive force on the internet, evolving from simple online jokes to a significant cultural phenomenon. Ray Chan, co-founder and CEO of 9GAG, the world's largest [[impact_of_memes_on_cryptocurrency_and_culture | memes platform]], describes 9GAG itself as a "[[impact_of_memes_on_cryptocurrency_and_culture | meme and attention monster]]" that has been built over 16 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This evolution highlights their power to capture and hold attention in the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Origin and Evolution of Memes

When 9GAG first started, it was simply a website for people to share funny photos and videos, and the founders initially "didn't even like the term memes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. At the time, memes were primarily understood as "image macro" (a photo with a caption), which felt "very limiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. However, over time, the term "meme" became a more important category, eventually equating to "funny stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

Many iconic memes, such as "Hide the Pain Harold," "Bad Luck Brian," "Success Kid," and "Grumpy Cat," did not originate as memes but were "ordinary photos on the internet" picked up and shared, often in forums or group chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Ray Chan believes that "you didn't choose the meme life, the meme life chose you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Great Meme

A great meme is one that people can resonate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. It allows individuals to share a feeling without extensive speaking or writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Often, memes thrive within an "insider group," where shared context is crucial for understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. For example, "WAGMI" ("We Are All Gonna Make It") is understandable within crypto communities but not necessarily to outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Memes essentially become a "more visualized" part of language, taking forms like photos, videos, or GIFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

## Memes and the Attention Economy

The internet has reshaped attention spans, with people now often watching videos shorter than a minute, and even as short as eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This attention-driven environment explains why many influencers tend to be "provoking" or constantly pivot to "hottest topic[s]" like crypto, politics, or AI, simply chasing where the attention is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This constant chase for "new shiny things" is likened to an "animal instinct" amplified by the internet and crypto, making people "act very wild" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Short-form content is designed to "grab the attention" quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The ultimate scarce resource is time, making attention the "most scarce resource" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. Capturing someone's attention is valuable because time is finite and cannot be regained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

## Memes, Web3, and Crypto

Ray Chan is also the co-founder of Memeland, an [[the_role_of_nfts_and_meme_coins | NFT ecosystem]] that combines meme culture with the power of [[the_role_of_nfts_and_meme_coins | NFTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His vision for Memeland is to be the company that "brings web3 to the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

Memeland has launched three [[the_role_of_nfts_on_digital_culture | NFTs]] and an [[understanding_meme_coins_and_their_place_in_the_financial_ecosystem | mcoin]] token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The core of Memeland is building a "community company" where people can "have fun and make money together" by aligning incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. Unlike Web2, where users are primarily data providers, Web3 allows even "small guys" to be part of the project and have a chance at financial returns through aligned incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Bringing Web3 to the People

Just as 9GAG bridged memes from niche forums to mainstream social media, Memeland aims to make Web3 simple and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. They seek to remove barriers like understanding seed phrases or hardware wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

One initiative to mainstream meme culture and Web3 is the establishment of the "first International Meme Day" on June 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>. This involved organizing gatherings at McDonald's across 10 cities worldwide, simply to "take a photo and stuff like that" and "Kickstart the tradition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.

## The Mission of 9GAG and Memeland

9GAG's mission, established 16 years ago, was "to make the world happier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This goal continues with Memeland, where the focus expands to include making the world "more meaningful as well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Ray Chan believes that for technology to achieve mass adoption, it must be made to "work for the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. This involves constant shipping of content and features, ensuring the platform is accessible, and that users find satisfaction daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. The accumulation of these daily efforts, rather than "overnight success," is key to building a long-lasting platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

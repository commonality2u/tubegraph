Yoann Turpin is recognized as a math genius and the founder of Wintermute, a leading global crypto market maker that provides liquidity on over 50 exchanges and trading platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Early Life and Education

Yoann Turpin was born in northern France, in what some would call a "bed of a bishop" in a communist mining town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. His father's side of the family was an industrial Catholic family, formerly wealthy in the paper industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. His mother, on the other hand, was a unionist glassblower who became a representative for employees in pension management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Turpin describes a "social split" in his childhood, managing two very different family backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

He was raised among second and third-generation immigrants, primarily Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and North African, which instilled in him a "positively hungry" and optimistic mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This environment taught him that people could improve their lives and that the next generation could achieve more than their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

From an early age, Turpin had clear career aspirations. At four, he wanted to be a fireman, then a doctor, then an astrophysicist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. By the age of 12, he was convinced he would go into trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. He would read the financial pages of newspapers and, at 12 years old, managed his father's family stock portfolio, even receiving a 10% performance fee with no high-water mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Between 15 and 18, he traded warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:07]</a>.

Turpin described himself as a child who had school "fairly easy" due to a good memory and being "excellent at math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. His older sister, who was three years his senior and wanted to be a teacher, would teach him math when he was around four years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. Being one of the younger cousins in a large family also pushed him to "catch up" and be competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. He learned to put a "ton of pressure" on himself and appreciated his parents being "lax" about his academic path, which fostered self-teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. He studied economics, with a significant part of his business management degree focused on math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.

### Sports and Self-Confidence

Turpin engaged in professional swimming from the age of four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. Being born on January 1st gave him an advantage in competitive age groups, especially during growth spurts, leading to numerous medals in swimming and running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. This sporting background was "crucial" for his self-confidence, providing an anchor when other areas, like math, became challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>. It also taught him to focus on self-improvement rather than comparing himself to competitors, a philosophy he applies in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

## Early Entrepreneurial Ventures

After university, Turpin worked at Optiver, a trading firm in Holland, from age 23 to 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:16:00">[48:16:00]</a>. Following a year-long non-compete clause, he started his first company, a trading firm at a family office, operating as a "micro hedge fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:30:00">[48:30:00]</a>. This venture performed well, returning about 162% in 2011, navigating events like the tsunami and the Greek crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a>. However, the [[entrepreneurial_journey_and challenges | entrepreneurial journey and challenges]] for this company became frustrating due to misaligned investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:17:00">[49:17:00]</a>. The business had "one leg" and was too cyclical, relying on large funds to create market dislocations for trading opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:47:00">[49:47:00]</a>. His investors were diversified but did not want his firm to compete with other groups they had invested in, leading to a separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:58:00">[50:58:00]</a>. This experience taught him the critical importance of choosing investors wisely, especially those with a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>.

His second venture was a Venture Studio, where he actively invested in B2B SaaS companies, advising up to 14 boards at the age of 31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>. He also established a cross-border deal-broking business between the UK and China, focusing on M&A deals under $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:32:00">[54:32:00]</a>. The main challenge with the Venture Studio model was scaling beyond a digital agency type of business and finding CEOs and teams to spin off products into independent startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07:00">[56:07:00]</a>. This phase served as an "exploration" and learning period, gaining insights into different industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:24:00">[54:24:00]</a>.

## Founding Wintermute

Turpin co-founded Wintermute at the very end of 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:09:00">[58:09:00]</a>. The idea came from a macro hedge fund allocating him funds to trade crypto, and he needed a senior, coding-proficient co-founder, as coding was not his "spike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-timestamp="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. He connected with his co-founder, Evgeny Gaevoy, through a former colleague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. Turpin brought fundraising experience, helping to take a "very good team out of the garage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

A key [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | lesson learned]] from previous ventures that was applied to Wintermute was the critical importance of choosing aligned, long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. They sought VCs willing to "bet in you for the long term" rather than fund allocators focused on daily returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This allowed Wintermute to focus on building for two years before actively trading in mid-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

Wintermute's business operations primarily consist of three areas today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>:
1.  **Spot Crypto Market Making:** They are the largest spot crypto market maker, covering 250 to 350 tokens across 80 venues, holding about 15% market share with a target of 20-25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
2.  **Derivatives Business (OTC):** They have a growing OTC (over-the-counter) derivatives business from Singapore, with over a thousand counterparties, ranging from high-net-worth individuals to $50 billion hedge funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. They also provide liquidity through APIs for platforms like robo-advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.
3.  **Investing:** Wintermute has deployed approximately $100 million across 100 teams, purely from its balance sheet, acting as a strategic investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
4.  **Venture Building:** They actively build new ventures, such as Bbop (a workforce platform) and wcat, and incubate or invest in early-stage projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

Wintermute aims to be a "good agent" in the crypto space, avoiding market manipulation and aligning long-term with the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Philosophy and Lessons Learned

### Competition and Focus
Turpin emphasizes not focusing on competition, as it can be discouraging and a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. He believes it's better to concentrate on internal efforts and doing what you do best, using competition only for "guidance" on new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. He views excessive focus on competitors as a "complete waste" of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. For startups, he suggests that unless you have 10-20% market share, you shouldn't worry about competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

In competitive swimming, he learned to focus on his own line and what he could achieve, rather than comparing himself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This philosophy applies to life generally; he advises individuals to focus on their "own line" and what they can achieve, especially given the distractions of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

### Resilience and Adaptability
While [[entrepreneurship_and_resilience_in_tech | entrepreneurship and resilience in tech]] is often seen as a key strength, Turpin argues that "too much resilience may just mean that you may not be able to discern what's good and bad feedback" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Resilience is only useful if one is going in the "right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. He highlights the need to be assertive about your direction but also to listen to feedback, even from "noisy" investors who might offer useful insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

He likens his own "no safety switch" capacity from swimming to a potential "bad trait," where he can push himself to the point of physical harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. In business, this means striking a fine line between being assertive with choices and listening to feedback, especially before achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. Too much resilience can become an excuse not to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>. This applies to personal relationships too; Turpin admits to having stayed in bad relationships for too long due to his own resilience, but has since changed his mindset to prioritize growth and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

> "Too much resilience may just mean that you may not be able to discern what's good and bad feedback." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>

### Scaling and Mindset
To scale a business from merely "paying the bills" to "mega profitable and scalable," Turpin recommends the "think 10x" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>. This involves asking how to multiply revenues by 10x with the current business model or if a transformation is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. He suggests focusing on a niche that can be dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. He also notes that most successful founders are around 40 years old, bringing maturity, experience in recruitment and capital aggregation, and fewer mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.

### Key Learnings
From his diverse [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | personal experiences with entrepreneurship and business challenges]], Turpin highlights:
*   **Communication:** He believes communication is the most important skill, especially for co-founder relationships and explaining long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Problems:** Agreeing on the critical 1% of problems that move the needle and ignoring the 99% that don't matter is crucial for management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:04">[01:55:04]</a>.
*   **Team and Culture:** The first 10 to 20 employees completely define a company's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. Keeping the team small helps maintain a consistent culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>. In-person collaboration is often more efficient than remote work, preventing misunderstandings and saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.
*   **Hiring:** Hiring smarter people is always advisable, with enough technical understanding to have a dialogue and avoid hiring the wrong person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>.
*   **Hard Work Over Talent:** Turpin believes "hard work eats talent for breakfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>. He prefers honest, smart, and hardworking individuals over "smart crooks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:13">[01:48:13]</a>. He found it insulting to be called a "genius" because it discounts effort and provides an excuse for others not to try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>.
*   **Emotional Intelligence (EQ) over IQ:** In the era of AI, EQ wins massively over IQ, as human interaction and diplomacy are less scalable and more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:31">[01:51:31]</a>.

### Investing Philosophy
Turpin started investing early and would continue even if he were to retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. He shifted from public market trading to private market investments (startups to pre-IPO deals) due to a perceived "better edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:14">[01:38:14]</a>. For him, the reward is less about money and more about backing the right entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:45">[01:38:45]</a>. He enjoys the intellectual challenge of meeting smarter people, helping them, and creating jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a>.

In crypto investing, he advises treating it like startup investing: put money in, be ready to run it off, forget about it for 3-5 years, and do not use leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:13">[02:01:13]</a>. He suggests having a model where if you're ready to lose 10-20%, you should aim to make 3-5 times more on winning positions, allowing winners to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:42">[02:03:42]</a>. He warns against "aping" to make millions from a few hundred dollars, as it's a "fluke" rather than a sustainable strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:22">[02:06:22]</a>.

His biggest prediction for the next 12 months (from the time of recording) is that Bitcoin (BTC) could exceed $100K due to institutional interest, front-running the classic cycle path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:51">[01:57:51]</a>. He also anticipates continued "booms and bursts" in crypto due to leverage and human psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">[02:00:23]</a>.

James B., founder of a $1.5 billion digital finance group and J Square, is an early investor in numerous companies and projects, including Circle, Ledger, Pudgy Penguins, and Polkadot, in which he proudly owns more than 1% of the total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Early Investment Philosophy and Bitcoin
James B. discovered Bitcoin in 2013 at 21 years old, during his undergraduate studies in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:53">[01:57:53]</a>. He recognized Bitcoin as an innovation that could solve the problem of traditional financial systems, particularly addressing high inflation and "money printing" in China, where M2 was growing at 14-15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:53">[01:57:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:11">[01:59:11]</a>. He saw Bitcoin as a decentralized system with reasonable inflation where no one could change the rules, offering a perfect solution to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:02">[02:27:02]</a>.

He started buying Bitcoin in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:30">[01:53:30]</a>. In 2015, his parents supported his idea to start a small investment firm focused on Bitcoin and other related businesses, providing an initial capital of $20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:20">[02:30:20]</a>. During this bear market, with Bitcoin priced around $150-$300, he invested most of the $20 million into Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:55">[02:33:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. By the peak of 2017, this initial investment was worth over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>.

## Evolution of [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto | Investment Strategies]]
A significant early mistake was not investing in ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>. James focused on equity deals in traditional-like businesses such as exchanges and infrastructure, rather than tokens, which he did not fully understand at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>. This oversight meant missing out on substantial gains that many others achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>.

Learning from this, he shifted his focus from equities to tokens, believing in their intrinsic value and future listing potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:20">[03:17:20]</a>. In 2018 and 2019, during another bear market, he made critical investments in layer one protocols like Polkadot and Solana via the OTC (Over-The-Counter) market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Polkadot's valuation was around $700-800 million, while Solana's was approximately $300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. His strategy was to own a significant percentage of the network, aiming for 1-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:52">[03:59:52]</a>. He still owns more than 1% of Polkadot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:52">[03:59:52]</a>. While he sold Solana too early (at less than $3), missing out on a much larger return, holding Polkadot until its peak (when it reached $50 and was ranked third in the market) yielded the main profit for his firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## [[The Role of NFTs and Meme Coins | NFTs]] and [[Crypto Adoption and the Role of Blockchain in Future Investments | Crypto Adoption]]
James B. believes that [[The Role of NFTs and Meme Coins | NFTs]] are a crucial avenue for [[Crypto Adoption and the Role of Blockchain in Future Investments | massive adoption]] of [[Role and future of tokens in cryptocurrency projects | cryptocurrency projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. He cites the example of Pudgy Penguins: it's easier to explain an NFT to someone outside the crypto industry than a complex protocol like Solana or Polkadot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

He invested in Pudgy Penguins last year (2022) during a severe bear market for NFTs, where OpenSea's trading volume dropped by 97% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Despite other VCs' hesitation, he saw it as an opportunity because there was "nothing to lose" if one believed in the future of NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. He attributes this investment to the team's ability to build a community and make things work, rather than just technological superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of technological advancements and market patterns on crypto investments | Investing in a Bear Market]] and Lessons Learned
In 2021, James B. de-risked his position by holding a lot of cash and stablecoins, anticipating a bear market, which was a good decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. However, he made a mistake by lending a significant portion of this capital to centralized platforms like Genesis and BlockFi, seeking stable yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:52">[04:59:52]</a>. When Luna collapsed in May 2022, he pulled some funds, but later, an unforeseen fixed-term contract with Genesis resulted in a nine-figure loss when FTX collapsed in November 2022, leading to Genesis's bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:52">[04:59:52]</a>.

The key lesson learned was that in a high-risk industry like crypto, seeking small, stable returns (e.g., 20% annual yield) is illogical and risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:02">[05:27:02]</a>. If one is in crypto, they should aim for high returns and accept high risk, or else move their assets to traditional, low-risk investments like banks or real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:02">[05:27:02]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Investment Framework
James B. recommends a portfolio size of 50 to 80 projects as optimal; exceeding 100 becomes unmanageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:55">[04:33:55]</a>. His firm now focuses on middle to late-stage deals, with ticket sizes typically ranging from $1 million to $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:55">[04:33:55]</a>.

Two areas he believes are deeply undervalued for future [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto | crypto investments]] are:
1.  **Layer One Protocols**: While Layer Two solutions are prevalent, James B. sees continued value in diverse Layer One protocols that focus on localized adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. He highlights projects like Astar in Japan or Shardeum in India as examples of networks gaining traction through localized strategies, even if their technology isn't necessarily superior to mainstream protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. This approach counters the common VC strategy of simply following what top firms like A16z and Paradigm are investing in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
2.  **Applications with Mainstream Adoption Potential**: Beyond [[Crypto and Blockchains Role in Global Finance | infrastructure]], applications that bring real-world usage and directly serve users are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. While DeFi remains valuable, new applications in areas like social finance or [[Investing in blockchain gaming and its potentials | blockchain gaming]] are key for the next wave of adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.

## Entrepreneurship and Survival in Crypto
Entrepreneurs in the crypto space must be passionate, persistent, and believe in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. They must be able to move forward despite immense pressure, including funding shortages, difficulty acquiring customers, or product issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. The biggest challenge for entrepreneurs, especially in crypto, is surviving the "winter" or bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>. Managing cash flow effectively is paramount during these periods, as many investors stop funding new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>. Successfully raising money during a bear market is a strong indicator of an entrepreneur's ability to navigate difficult conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

## Personal Beliefs and Reflections
James B. believes that [[The role of blockchain in future wealth creation | crypto itself]] is still widely misunderstood and not accepted by most people today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>. He attributes this to people often investing at the wrong time (e.g., late stage in 2022) and losing money, which then sours their view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. For long-term success, investors need to develop their own independent thesis and conviction, rather than simply following what others, including large VCs, are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>. The investing game is often a solitary journey that requires courage and independent thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX and current CIO at Malstrom Fund, is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, known for his insights on macroeconomics and his role in the development of Bitcoin derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Genesis of BitMEX

Hayes' journey into crypto began after losing his job, leading him to explore Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. He discovered [[Insights on crypto trading and market strategies | crypto trading]] through reading about Bitcoin on Zero Hedge and delving into its white paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. His initial foray involved arbitrage opportunities, particularly with Bitcoin futures contracts on a small exchange called IC Bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. He noticed that these futures often traded at a significant premium or discount to the spot price, offering substantial annualized returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

He personally tested this by sending $1,000 to Mt. Gox, buying Bitcoin, selling futures on the random exchange, and confirming his anticipated profits after a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Following this, he engaged in arbitrage between Chinese exchanges (Huobi, BTC China, OKCoin) and international ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This involved physically transporting cash to Hong Kong banks, wiring funds to exchanges like Bitfinex, buying Bitcoin at international prices, sending it to Chinese exchanges, selling for RMB, and then withdrawing cash to repeat the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This unique geographical advantage in Hong Kong allowed for physical arbitrage, yielding 20% to 40% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

The idea for BitMEX arose from the frustration with IC Bit's reluctance to improve its product offering, increase liquidity, and grow the exchange, which limited traders' potential earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Hayes felt confident he could build a better Bitcoin derivatives exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. He co-founded BitMEX with Ben D, who built trading systems, and Sam Reed, who developed web applications, starting development in early 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Building Through the Bear Market

BitMEX launched in November 2014, taking 11 months to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This period coincided with the Mt. Gox hack and the onset of a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Despite the challenging market conditions, the founders decided against seeking venture capital funding, believing that exchanges inherently make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This bootstrapping approach, combined with side hustles, allowed them to cover operational costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The Mt. Gox incident also solidified BitMEX's ethos of transparency and "not your keys, not your coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

For about a year after launch, BitMEX saw essentially zero volume, making it a disheartening period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. However, Hayes remained "100% confident that Bitcoin derivatives or [[Crypto investment strategies | crypto derivatives]] would be massive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, with a few companies making significant money. The main concern was simply surviving long enough to reach that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Innovations and Market Dominance

The turning point for BitMEX began in the fall of 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Recognizing the demand for leverage from Chinese traders, BitMEX decided to offer 100x leverage, significantly higher than the 20x offered by competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This move differentiated them, as they were able to implement this high leverage without losing money as an exchange, thanks to superior math and technology in their margining systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This quickly led to increased volume and cash flow positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

In 2016, BitMEX introduced the "Perpetual Swap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Initially, it was an "abject failure," receiving significant negative feedback from clients who preferred traditional futures contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The Perpetual Swap was designed to be more intuitive for trading and to consolidate liquidity into one product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. After internal debate, the team continued to iterate on the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. By 2017, it began to catch on, leading to "massive volumes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

During the bull market of 2017, BitMEX experienced significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. However, the "golden moment" for BitMEX was actually the bear market of 2018-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Because the platform allowed for shorting, it thrived regardless of market direction, making money whether prices went up or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. With competitors taking a year and a half to adopt similar products, BitMEX had the derivatives market largely to itself and could charge relatively high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. During this period of intense growth, the focus shifted to managing HR issues, scaling the technology, and constantly "putting out fires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## The March 2020 Incident and Lessons Learned

On March 12-13, 2020, as the global market collapsed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BitMEX experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, causing the exchange to go offline for about 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. During this period, prices collapsed, leading to significant liquidations for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Hayes clarified that the exchange was not intentionally shut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

The incident was a "death liquidation candle," after which the market rallied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. However, it was a challenging moment for the exchange because many users lost money due to not fully understanding how these "exotic derivatives" worked on the downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. A significant number of customers left BitMEX for platforms that did not use Bitcoin as a collateral mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

Internally, BitMEX reviewed the damage and assessed if the exchange lost money (it did not) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Despite customer complaints and internal debates about special treatment or moral hazard, the exchange ultimately stuck to its rules, deciding not to compensate those who lost funds, viewing it as "part of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Hayes stated he never thought about what BitMEX would be like if COVID hadn't happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

## Macroeconomic Outlook and [[Investment strategies in cryptocurrency | Crypto Investment Strategies]]

Hayes also writes extensively on macroeconomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. His view is that regardless of the Federal Reserve's actions, Bitcoin will always present a "buy the dip" opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. He posits that the world has accumulated massive debt post-WWII due to Keynesian economic theories of government intervention and spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Coupled with declining productivity, less integration, and rising energy costs, this has led to persistent inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

Hayes argues that governments cannot "will out of existence" inflation in essential goods like food and rent, which significantly impacts the common person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Faced with the choice between fighting inflation by restraining credit (which makes it hard for governments to fund their massive debts) and fulfilling promises to the public, politicians will likely choose the latter by printing more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

Hayes believes the "end game is some sort of societal reset," possibly leading to a "biggest Fiat money printing bubble ever" to save the sovereign bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. He suggests that in such a scenario, individuals should prioritize owning a house and ensuring their food supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

On the "stealth financial crisis," Hayes explains that banks, encouraged by regulators, bought vast amounts of government debt at historically low interest rates using deposits from COVID-19 stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. When central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation, bond prices fell, rendering much of the global banking system, and indeed the entire Fiat financial system, "insolvent" under proper accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. The current struggle is a political one to determine who bears the cost of this bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

### Key [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets | Investment Strategy]]: Patience and Asymmetric Returns

From a [[Investment strategies in the crypto market | crypto investment]] perspective, Hayes stresses the importance of constructing a portfolio with "asymmetric returns on the upside" that doesn't cost much to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. Echoing BitMEX's early days, the core strategy is to "stay in the game long enough to reap the rewards of the next bull market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. This implies holding a normal job or other income streams to pay bills while remaining invested, patiently waiting for the market to pick up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.

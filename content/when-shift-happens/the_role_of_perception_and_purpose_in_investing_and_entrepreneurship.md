## Purpose Beyond Materialism

Entrepreneurship and investing, when driven solely by the pursuit of wealth, can lead to a sense of emptiness and disconnection from oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. Individuals who achieve significant financial success through materialistic pursuits often realize that no amount of money can compensate for deep-seated insecurities or internal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>.

Experiencing extreme wealth without a clear purpose can lead to a quick return to "normality" as the initial excitement of material possessions, like a Ferrari or expensive restaurants, fades and becomes mundane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>. This phenomenon is supported by studies on lottery winners, who often return to their baseline level of happiness within six months to a year, even if they retain their winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. This highlights that money, without a higher goal, does not solve internal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.

Instead, money should be viewed as a consequence of a purpose that is much higher than itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. The true value lies in collecting memories, not just figures or numbers, aligning with a philosophy that prioritizes experiences and deeper meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.

## Money as a Tool for Manifestation

Finance and money can be seen as powerful tools for manifestation and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:23">[02:25:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:52">[02:25:52]</a>. By exchanging personal time for money, individuals effectively "vote" on which people or industries they want to see grow, thereby shaping the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:06">[02:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:35">[02:25:35]</a>. For example, investments in companies like SpaceX could lead humanity to Mars, while investments in sustainability could preserve Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:12">[02:26:12]</a>.

## Perception in Finance and Business

### Critique of the Venture Capital (VC) Model
The current VC model is criticized for its focus on short-term gains and misaligned incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Many VCs, especially those who are employees of a fund rather than investing their own money, prioritize keeping their jobs and generating quick returns for their LPs over fostering truly innovative or sustainable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:03">[02:55:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:20">[02:58:20]</a>. This often leads to backing "crazy ideas" only if they fit existing models, resulting in thousands of similar applications rather than genuine innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>.

SwissBorg, for example, intentionally avoided VC funding because the co-founders did not agree with how VCs measure value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:28">[02:55:28]</a>. Their focus is on loyalty and community, recognizing that in an increasingly digital and AI-driven world where technology development costs are plummeting, brand and community will be the true value drivers for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:46">[02:56:46]</a>. In crypto, where assets can be transferred instantly, community connection becomes even more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:02">[02:58:02]</a>.

The speaker argues that the VC model is "failing 100%" because it hasn't adapted to measure new forms of value beyond traditional monetary metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:25">[02:58:25]</a>. This leads to absurd valuations and massive company failures. A glaring example is that 50% of listed companies in the US are not profitable and may never be, turning them into "memes" of the traditional financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:43">[02:59:43]</a>. This situation arose from low interest rates and excessive money printing, pushing investors to funnel capital into growth-focused VC startups without a clear path to profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:33">[03:03:33]</a>.

### The Free Rider Concept
This behavior is linked to the "Free Rider" concept in economics, where individuals or entities benefit from a public good without contributing to its cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. In finance, this translates to investors or businesses engaging in short-term thinking, knowing that others might bear the risks or costs, ultimately hindering the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This is exacerbated in crypto, where people might knowingly participate in "Ponzi" schemes, believing they are smart enough to exit before collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:41">[03:24:41]</a>.

Investing, ideally, should be a "positive sum game" where collective effort leads to shared growth, unlike trading which is a "zero sum game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:25">[03:29:25]</a>. However, the prevalence of short-term thinking often turns investment into a destructive cycle for long-term holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:58">[03:29:58]</a>.

### The Problem with Price-Driven Metrics
A fundamental issue in finance is that 90-99% of information is related to price (market cap, volatility, etc.), rather than the actual value created by entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:21">[03:25:21]</a>. This price-centric view fuels a mindset where people make investment decisions based on charts they don't fully understand or the prospect of quick wealth, rather than the underlying philosophy or achievements of a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

To transform this, the speaker suggests that fintech needs to reinvent how people discover investments, moving beyond price-driven inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:37">[03:26:37]</a>. The ideal scenario would be to invest based on trust in a project's purpose and the values of its founders, as shared through stories or recommendations, rather than just market figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:41">[03:29:41]</a>.

## The Role of Personal Journeys and Experiences

[[personal_reflections_on_entrepreneurship_and_mindset | Personal Reflections on Entrepreneurship and Mindset]] play a crucial role in shaping one's perception and purpose. The speaker's journey from growing up in France, pursuing engineering and then finance in London, ultimately led to a feeling of deep loneliness despite external success and titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>. This disconnection from himself stemmed from a misalignment with the values and operational methods of traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">[02:42:20]</a>.

This period of unhappiness served as a catalyst, prompting a shift in perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:34">[03:17:34]</a>. The speaker dedicated free time to entrepreneurial pursuits, reconnecting with friends who were also entrepreneurs, which provided the energy and conviction to pursue a new path, even at the risk of losing material possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:51">[03:32:51]</a>. This highlights the importance of finding an "additional source of energy" to change one's limiting perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a>.

True knowledge, it is argued, comes from experience, not just reading books or theoretical education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. While education provides concepts and inspiration, it doesn't impart the direct understanding that comes from lived experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:12">[01:52:12]</a>. This aligns with a skepticism towards traditional academia, especially when professors lack real-world experience in the fields they teach, leading to a focus on theory rather than practical application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>.

Entrepreneurship should ideally stem from a deep frustration with the status quo and a genuine desire to solve a problem for oneself, rather than solely from the motivation to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:38">[03:33:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:06">[03:36:06]</a>. This intrinsic drive provides the resilience needed to overcome the inevitable tough moments and challenges of building a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:01">[03:37:01]</a>.

[[the_dynamics_and_qualities_of_effective_startup_founders_and_investors | The dynamics and qualities of effective startup founders and investors]] are influenced by how they manage perception and purpose. At the peak of a bull market, founders might become "cocky," dismissing feedback when it's most crucial to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:57">[03:44:57]</a>. Conversely, during bear markets, when external validation is sought, it's vital to reconnect with fundamental values and trust one's own judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:02">[03:46:02]</a>. This counter-cyclical approach applies to investors too, who should be cautious when things seem "too good to be true" and follow their gut when others are fearful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:58">[03:46:58]</a>.

## Shaping Perceptions with Crypto

Crypto has the unique ability to accelerate the adoption of new ideas and movements by incentivizing participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. Using the example of Wim Hof, who took 10 years for his cold bath method to gain acceptance, crypto tokens could offer immediate incentives, encouraging more people to try new experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:21">[03:41:21]</a>. Even if individuals are initially motivated by greed, the process of engaging with the incentivized experience can lead them to understand and adopt the underlying philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:53">[03:41:53]</a>.

This "gamified" approach allows entrepreneurs to "hack" the system, reducing the time needed for people to accept a new idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:57">[03:43:57]</a>. It provides a means to honor early adopters, like the first Uber drivers, who were crucial to a company's success but rarely shared in its long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:03">[03:43:03]</a>. This fosters loyalty and trust, which are key to building sustainable businesses in the decentralized future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:47">[03:43:47]</a>.

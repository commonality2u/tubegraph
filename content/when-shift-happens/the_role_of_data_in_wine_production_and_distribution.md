Historically, the wine industry, particularly the market for [[investment_grade_wine_as_an_asset_class | investment grade wine]], has operated with a significant lack of accessible data, leading to opacity and inefficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. This contrasts sharply with other industries where data-driven decisions are standard practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. However, companies like Divin Labs are working to integrate modern data collection and [[blockchain_technology_in_the_wine_industry | blockchain technology]] to revolutionize wine production, distribution, and consumption.

## Data in Wine Production

Traditionally, winemaking relied heavily on the intuition of a "great wine maker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. David Garrett, co-founder and CEO of Divin Labs, approached wine production with a "tech mind," seeking to de-risk the process through data collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

### Vineyard Optimization through Data
Garrett's team systematically collected data from successful vineyards in the Mendoza region to understand the elements contributing to great wines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. This involved deconstructing existing successful wines and their production environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. Key data points collected included:
*   **Geographical and climatic factors**: Elevation of the vineyard, angle to the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Vine characteristics**: Root stock, clone (plant type) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   **Vineyard layout**: Distance between rows and plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Winemaking process**: Brix level at harvest, type of oak and tanks used, and aging duration in oak and bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

This extensive data collection allowed them to strategically design their own vineyard in Argentina as a "laboratory," consisting of many small, one-acre plots, each with different angles and formations, mirroring successful existing vineyards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. This data-driven planting method significantly de-risked winemaking, resulting in a "take rate" (successful vine planting) of close to 95%, compared to the normal 70-80% in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

## Data in Wine Distribution and Sales

While traditional wine distribution and sales relied on a complex network of middlemen and gatekeepers, Garrett's early ventures also focused on building a distribution network with data in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

### Early Data-Driven Distribution
To address the long lead time between planting vines and selling wine (up to 10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, Garrett's team focused on building early distribution channels:
*   **Information Center**: In downtown Mendoza, they created a free information center for wine tourists, providing English-speaking staff, building itineraries, and setting up winery appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. In exchange, they collected thousands of customer email addresses, understanding their preferences for Argentine wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Tasting Room**: They opened a tasting room offering 80 different wines by the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This allowed them to build relationships with winemakers lacking U.S. distribution and establish a wine club. Customers could order wines to be shipped from a U.S. warehouse, effectively building a customer base and direct-to-consumer shipping capabilities before their own wine was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

## Challenges of Data Scarcity in the Traditional Wine Industry

The wine industry faces several unique challenges due to a lack of data, particularly regarding consumption:
*   **Lack of Consumer Connectivity**: Winemakers are separated from consumers by significant time (often 10 years until consumption) and distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. This makes direct feedback loops nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
*   **Inefficient Product Development**: Without consumer feedback, winemakers cannot adapt their products effectively. Unlike digital products with instant feedback, changes in wine recipes are delayed by years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
*   **Suboptimal Supply Chain Management**: Luxury winemakers produce limited quantities. Without knowing where and when their wines are consumed, they struggle to efficiently allocate products globally, impacting revenue maximization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
*   **Difficult Customer Acquisition**: Advertising luxury wine is restricted, making it hard for brands to tell their story, build loyalty, or acquire new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Incentives in Existing Platforms**: Platforms like Vivino, while popular, have misaligned incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. Users are rewarded for extreme or controversial reviews, not for providing genuine feedback that could help winemakers with product development or marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

## [[blockchain_technology_in_the_wine_industry | Blockchain]] as a Solution for Data Transparency

Divin is leveraging [[blockchain_technology_in_the_wine_industry | blockchain technology]] to address these data challenges and transform wine from a "possession into an asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

### The Digital Cork and VIN Coin
Divin's core innovation is the "digital cork," a universal protocol to put a bottle of wine on the blockchain, serving as a digital deed of ownership or digital product passport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>. This digital cork tracks:
*   Chain of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>
*   Chain of custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>
*   Provenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>
*   Anti-fraud and anti-counterfeit protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>

A unique aspect is the mechanism for "destroying" the digital asset when the wine is consumed. When a user opens and drinks a bottle, they can easily "destroy" the digital cork with their phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. In return, they receive a "tasting token" (an authentic proof of experience) and **VINCoin**, a native token built on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.

This system creates a comprehensive feedback loop:
*   **Consumption Data**: Winemakers gain insights into where and when their bottles are being opened, addressing the unique purchase-consumption separation in wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. This data informs product development, marketing, and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain Optimization**: Knowing consumption locations helps winemakers more efficiently allocate their limited product globally, maximizing revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>.
*   **Customer Acquisition and Loyalty**: Winemakers can connect directly with consumers, offer rewards and status (e.g., "premier crew member"), and invite them to exclusive events like tastings or dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. This builds loyal customer relationships and brand identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.

VINCoin functions like "air miles for wine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. Consumers can use it to buy more wine, purchase experiences (winery tours, harvest experiences), or redeem it with other luxury brands interested in high-end wine consumers (e.g., Four Seasons, Rolls-Royce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. The ability to trade VINCoin on exchanges also adds a financial incentive for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## Increased [[challenges_and_innovations_in_wine_distribution | Liquidity]] and Access to [[investment_grade_wine_as_an_asset_class | Investment Grade Wine]]

The lack of transparency, price discovery, and easy market entry has historically restricted access to [[investment_grade_wine_as_an_asset_class | investment grade wine]] to older generations and large players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. By creating a digital deed of ownership, Divin aims to solve these problems:
*   **Price Transparency and Discovery**: Knowing precisely how many bottles of a given vintage remain on the market allows for accurate pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. Global price transparency will ensure bottles trade at similar values worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.
*   **Increased [[challenges_and_innovations_in_wine_distribution | Liquidity]]**: Greater transparency and access are expected to bring significant [[challenges_and_innovations_in_wine_distribution | liquidity]] into the wine marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.
*   **Accessibility for Younger Investors**: The goal is to open up [[investment_grade_wine_as_an_asset_class | investment grade wine]] to younger generations who may be priced out of other asset classes like real estate or stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>. This allows them to invest in an experiential asset class they are passionate about, potentially identifying future [[investment_grade_wine_as_an_asset_class | investment grade wines]] early on, similar to how they might engage with [[web3_and_the_tokenization_of_wine_industry | meme coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>.
*   **Level Playing Field**: By creating a transparent and accessible system, Divin seeks to establish a level playing field for exchanges and marketplaces globally, bringing new [[challenges_and_innovations_in_wine_distribution | liquidity]] and opportunities to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

Divin's long-term vision is to drive "civilian adoption" of [[web3_and_the_tokenization_of_wine_industry | blockchain technology]] by abstracting away the technical complexities, allowing everyday consumers to participate in fun, functional projects without needing to understand wallets or NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. This generational approach aims to build tools that future generations of wine lovers and makers will use seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>.

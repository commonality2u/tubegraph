## Early Challenges and Market Insight

When Bybit, the world's third-largest crypto exchange by volume, was founded, its co-founder and CEO, Ben, faced significant challenges in attracting users to a nascent platform [00:10:00]. Despite the team's initial focus on developing more trading pairs, Ben recognized that the core problem was a lack of user awareness and trust in the new exchange [01:09:53]. The prevailing strategy among established crypto exchanges like BitMEX and OKX at the time involved a basic referral program: users would copy a link, promote it, and receive a discount or commission if new clients joined under them [01:08:27]. This model lacked transparency regarding how commissions were calculated, leaving influencers unaware of their true earning potential [01:08:57].

Ben observed that while the cryptocurrency industry was still in its early stages of development, the Forex industry had a more advanced approach to affiliate marketing [01:09:29]. Forex affiliates typically operated on a commission-based model, making them much more aggressive and successful than those in crypto who often charged a flat "pay-per-shield" fee ($500 per mention or video) [01:09:32]. This insight revealed a significant opportunity: crypto influencers were underestimating their ability to convert users and earn substantial commissions [01:09:25].

## Bybit's Revolutionary Approach

Recognizing this gap, Ben made a bold decision to prioritize the development of a comprehensive affiliate portal over building additional trading pairs [01:10:09]. He redirected his development team to create this portal, a move that he claims revolutionized the industry and was subsequently copied by competitors [01:10:23].

Key features of Bybit's affiliate portal included:
*   **Full Transparency** The portal provided crystal-clear data to affiliates, detailing how many clicks their links received, how many users signed up, deposited, and traded, and the exact commissions generated [01:10:50].
*   **Advanced Analytics (CRM)** Affiliates could generate unique links for different platforms (e.g., YouTube, Twitter) and compare their conversion rates, allowing them to optimize their promotional strategies [01:10:50].
*   **Empowering Tools** The system offered automated campaign generation, enabling partners to easily set up competitions for their communities and other tools to aid conversion [01:12:00].

This approach allowed Bybit to attract a large number of affiliates and YouTubers, gaining significant momentum and liquidity almost immediately [01:11:30]. The first affiliates alone brought in hundreds to thousands of new users, rapidly boosting trading volume [01:12:34].

## Importance of a Transparent and Empowering Affiliate Model

Bybit's success in affiliate marketing highlights several crucial points for [[digital_marketing_strategies_in_the_era_of_social_media_and_crypto | digital marketing strategies in the era of social media and crypto]]:
*   **Understanding Influencer Motivation**: Influencers, like any business, are driven by clear, measurable returns. Providing a transparent system that shows direct correlation between their efforts and earnings incentivizes more aggressive and effective promotion [01:09:38].
*   **Empowering Affiliates with Data**: Giving affiliates access to detailed analytics allows them to optimize their strategies, understand their audience better, and improve their conversion rates [01:11:19].
*   **Focusing on User Acquisition Early**: For new platforms, user acquisition can be more critical than feature parity. A strong marketing and sales team, even before a fully developed product, can be crucial [01:07:37].
*   **Adaptability**: Identifying a market gap and shifting development priorities (from product features to marketing infrastructure) allowed Bybit to gain a competitive edge [01:10:00].

This strategy demonstrates how a deep understanding of marketing mechanics, particularly those from other industries like Forex, can be leveraged to revolutionize [[sponsorship_and_marketing_strategies_in_the_crypto_industry | sponsorship and marketing strategies in the crypto industry]] and gain significant market share.

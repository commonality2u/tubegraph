Naoris Protocol is presented as a universal trust system designed to address fundamental problems in digital environments by leveraging existing decentralization and strong mathematical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It aims to prove that systems are in a "good state for everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Problem of Centralization and Trust
The core issue identified by Naoris Protocol is centralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Current systems, including traditional IT infrastructures and even blockchain validators, often operate from central points of failure or rely on numerous assumptions, leading to significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This means there is no way to mathematically prove that a system, process, or server is in a trusted state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

### Security vs. Trust
A key philosophical distinction for Naoris Protocol is that security is different from trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a>. While security might involve protection measures (like a guard with a gun), true trust means knowing the integrity of the underlying system or entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. In digital systems, this relates to knowing if data has been tampered with or if an AI model is ingesting data from a good source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.

## Naoris Protocol's Solution: Decentralized Trust
Naoris Protocol decentralizes trust itself from an infrastructure perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>. It uses mathematical principles, likened to "quantum fingerprints," to allow machines to validate and verify each other, similar to how people in a village know who to trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

### Post-Quantum Blockchain in Production
Naoris Protocol claims to be the first post-quantum blockchain in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>. This is crucial because current cryptography (elliptic curve cryptography) is vulnerable to quantum computers, which are becoming increasingly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

*   **Quantum Threat:** Quantum computers excel at mathematics and can potentially break cryptographic keys that would take classical computers billions of years to crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. This means data harvested now could be decrypted in the near future, leading to a massive geopolitical imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
*   **Quantum Resistance:** Post-quantum cryptography provides algorithms resistant to these quantum threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. Countries like China, the European Union, and the US are heavily investing in quantum technologies and developing quantum plans to mitigate future risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.
*   **Sub-Zero Layer:** Naoris Protocol introduces a "sub-zero layer" that decentralizes the infrastructure of any blockchain (Layer 1 or Layer 2), ensuring validators can prove their trustworthiness to each other and are not compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
*   **Transaction Protection:** It also applies post-quantum protection to transactions themselves, addressing the risk of adversaries manipulating signed, broadcasted transactions (e.g., double-spending or changing destinations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

## Funding and Investors
Naoris Protocol has raised $36 million, attracting investors like Tim Draper, a notable Bitcoin OG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>. A significant portion of these funds is allocated to research and development to create these advanced technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.

## Use Cases and Impact
The protocol's impact extends far beyond the Web3 space, targeting the broader global economy with a focus on criticality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>. Its technology can be applied to:
*   Telecommunications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>
*   Software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>
*   Robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>
*   Car manufacturing (smart cars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>
*   Other industries with high-value assets and processes that currently rely on assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

Naoris Protocol aims to create a new paradigm of trust that is fundamental to any digital system or operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. It supports the vision of Web4 as a quantum-driven internet with trust and AI by design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>.

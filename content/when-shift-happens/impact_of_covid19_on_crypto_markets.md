The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant and multi-faceted impact on the crypto markets, exemplified by the events of March 2020. This period saw extreme volatility, operational challenges for exchanges, and a re-evaluation of macroeconomic policies that ultimately influenced the trajectory of digital assets.

## The "Black Thursday" Incident at BitMEX

On March 12, 2020, as the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and traditional stock markets saw massive declines, the crypto market experienced a sharp downturn, leading to what is often referred to as "Black Thursday" for its severe price collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. For derivative exchanges like BitMEX, the situation was particularly chaotic.

During this period, BitMEX experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, causing the exchange to go offline for approximately 15 minutes to an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. While some speculated the exchange intentionally shut down, it was confirmed to be a DDoS attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Prices of cryptocurrencies collapsed, with some assets like Ethereum dropping 50-70% in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. After the exchange came back online, the market quickly rallied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

However, the rapid liquidation of positions due to the market's collapse and the specific mechanics of exotic derivatives caused many users to lose significant amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. As a consequence, many customers left BitMEX for other platforms that did not use Bitcoin as a collateral mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Despite customer complaints and internal philosophical discussions, BitMEX maintained its position that the rules of the exchange were upheld, and no special treatment or policy changes were implemented to favor specific groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

## Macroeconomic Shifts and Their Crypto Implications

The COVID-19 crisis prompted governments globally to implement massive stimulus programs and quantitative easing measures. This led to a significant increase in bank deposits worldwide, particularly in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. Regulators encouraged banks to buy government debt, which was seen as a "bad trade" given low economic growth and low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. Financial regulations were designed to incentivize institutions like pension funds, insurance products, and banks to purchase government debt, often allowing them to leverage it infinitely without impacting capital requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

The subsequent emergence of inflation, partly fueled by these policies, forced central banks to raise interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This caused bond yields to rise and bond prices to fall, leading to widespread insolvency within the global Fiat financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

According to some macroeconomic views, this situation presents a dilemma:
*   **Lowering interest rates**: This would help the insolvent financial system and would be good for asset prices, including Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.
*   **Continuing to fight inflation**: Increasing interest rates would lead to more insolvencies, requiring bailouts through money printing, which is also seen as beneficial for Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

This perspective suggests that either path the central banks take to address the current economic challenges—whether through lowering rates or bailouts requiring more money printing—is ultimately favorable for crypto assets like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that the system is "all insolvent" unless a new form of energy or productivity boost emerges, making it a matter of managing this insolvency politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. This long-term view encourages investors to stay in the game long enough to benefit from future bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.

Overall, the [[The significance of macroeconomic trends in the crypto space | macroeconomic trends]] exacerbated by COVID-19 have reinforced the narrative for crypto assets as a hedge against traditional financial system instability and inflation.

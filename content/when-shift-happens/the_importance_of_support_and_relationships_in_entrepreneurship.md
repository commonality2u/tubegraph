Anil Lulum, co-founder and CEO of Deli Digital, a research-driven firm dedicated to advancing the understanding and development of the digital asset market, emphasizes that building a successful company in the crypto space is incredibly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. He highlights that success isn't about getting rich quick; it demands time, effort, and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A key factor in navigating these [[challenges_and_solutions_in_entrepreneurship | challenges and solutions in entrepreneurship]] and achieving success lies in the strength of one's relationships and the support system around them.

## The Foundation of Strong Co-founder Relationships

Working with best friends has been a "huge superpower" for Deli Digital, despite the trade-offs it presents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:17">[04:17:17]</a>. Anil and his co-founders, including MJ and Yan with whom he lived and worked for a decade, experienced huge fights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:57">[09:51:57]</a>. However, these conflicts were never driven by ego, but rather by a shared passion for what was best for the company as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:09">[04:50:09]</a>. This dynamic fostered trust and demonstrated their collective care for the brand's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:41">[04:50:41]</a>. They believe that not fighting would have been more concerning, as it would indicate a lack of care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:04">[04:43:04]</a>.

Instead of attacking each other, they attacked ideas, sometimes with swearing, but always focusing on the concept rather than the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:37">[04:33:37]</a>. This approach allowed them to passionately debate without personal animosity, contributing to their ability to build one of the most successful companies in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This highlights a unique aspect of [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | personal experiences with entrepreneurship and business challenges]].

## The Indispensable Role of Family Support

Anil emphasizes the profound impact of parental belief and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>. When he decided to quit his job to start Deli, the person he was most afraid to tell was his father, an accountant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a>. Despite not fully understanding the crypto industry, his father was "nothing but supportive," telling him he wouldn't stop him from pursuing his decision and expressing confidence that he would succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:45">[02:29:45]</a>. This unwavering support was crucial, as Anil states it's "probably the two most important people who can believe in you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>.

His family's upbringing instilled in him and his sister the belief that they "will do great things," not just that they should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>. This early [[the_influence_of_early_life_experiences_on_entrepreneurial_success | influence of early life experiences on entrepreneurial success]] and expectation of fulfilling potential, combined with a core belief that "there's nothing worse than wasted potential," has profoundly guided his entrepreneurial journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:25">[02:34:25]</a>.

## Cultivating a Supportive Community

Anil believes that success is not a finite resource and encourages celebrating the achievements of others, as their victories contribute to a collective sense of accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:35">[02:37:35]</a>. He considers his "only core superpower" to be believing in people, which is "free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>.

A pivotal moment for Deli was when Ari Paul, a significant influence in the early crypto days, simply told them their idea for a research company was "really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:15">[03:13:15]</a>. This small gesture of belief, the only one they received before launching Deli, changed their trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:27">[03:27:27]</a>.

He actively seeks to connect with people on a human level, asking about their journeys and passions, which makes him "super bullish" on life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:39">[04:50:39]</a>. This approach builds genuine connections within the industry.

## Resilience Through Shared Adversity

The support system within Deli Digital was tested during the Luna crash, which happened around Anil's 30th birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Despite sinking significant money, time, and energy into projects on Luna, almost no one on their team left after the crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39">[03:37:39]</a>. This was a testament to their culture and [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | mindset and personal growth in entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>.

Anil recounts that while many celebrated their misfortune, and even "friends" in the space didn't reach out, those who stuck by them were unforgettable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. During the crisis, the founders communicated openly with the team, assuring them that Deli would "power forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This collective [[entrepreneurship_and_resilience_in_tech | resilience in tech]] and the support of genuine friends helped them recover mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:01">[03:07:01]</a>. Anil states that every time they expected something to go right for Deli and it didn't, it ultimately made them better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:05">[03:43:05]</a>.

## "Find Your Tribe": A Key to Success

Anil strongly advocates for finding a "tribe" â€“ a small, motivated group committed to helping each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:20">[02:23:20]</a>. He contrasts this with the "PVP" (player-versus-player) mentality often seen in crypto, where people compete rather than collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:32">[02:24:32]</a>. Deli's internal "Pure Alpha" and "Reads" chats exemplify this, fostering trust and knowledge sharing without internal competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:11">[02:24:11]</a>. This collaborative environment ensures that the team benefits from diverse perspectives and deep insights, powered by their "hive mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of making a good impression and building a strong reputation with everyone you meet, especially in the smaller-than-it-seems crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:36">[02:16:36]</a>. Anil makes a point to reply to nearly everyone who reaches out, even if it's just to offer encouragement, because he remembers his own early struggles and the importance of being "felt and seen as humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. He views his ability to say "yes" to many conversations as a leverage, leveraging his three divisions (research, ventures, labs) to find value and potential connections even if not for direct investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:42">[02:18:42]</a>.

## Prioritizing Well-being and Relationships

While acknowledging that prioritizing health, relationships, and time can feel like a luxury only the wealthy can afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:45">[05:14:45]</a>, Anil stresses their immense importance. He admits to neglecting his health and relationships in the early, intensely busy years of Deli, living off credit cards and working long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:58">[05:17:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. His wife, who supported him by bringing food and understanding his demanding schedule, is an example of an important relationship that sustained him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

Now that he has more "breathing room," he dedicates time to his well-being, including daily cold plunges and sauna sessions, which enhance his energy and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. He also makes time for activities that foster relationships, such as writing postcards to friends and family while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. These practices underscore a shift towards a more balanced approach to life, integrating [[impact_of_entrepreneurship_on_mental_health | mental health]] and personal connections into his entrepreneurial journey.

In conclusion, for Anil Lulum, the ability to build and sustain a successful venture in a demanding industry like crypto is deeply intertwined with the quality of his relationships. From the challenging yet ego-free dynamics with his co-founders to the unwavering support of his family and the broader community, these connections have provided the bedrock for his [[entrepreneurship_and_resilience_in_tech | resilience in tech]] and shaped his definition of success and fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.

Building strong networks and consistently providing value are crucial for success in the crypto industry, extending beyond just technical skills or market timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. This approach is not limited to financial gains but also fosters personal growth and reputation.

## Networking as a Catalyst for Learning and Opportunity

For Jason Choy, co-founder of Tangent and host of The Block Crunch podcast, networking was initially a means to acquire knowledge. His podcast began simply as an "excuse to get people on the show and talk to me" and to teach him about crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>. This strategy proved effective, as he was able to secure interviews with prominent figures in the space who would otherwise not have engaged with "just a college grad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:10">[01:46:10]</a>.

During bear markets, networking becomes even more critical. People are more receptive to engagement, and showing presence during challenging times builds credibility. As Choy notes, if you are "there in the bare Market they will take you seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. This approach allowed his podcast to "quickly differentiate" itself because "nobody was doing it" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

Choy was inspired by Harry Stebbings, who built a significant venture capital network and raised funds by starting a podcast at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. The lesson learned is that one can "start with no background and kind of network your way into this and the way to scale is Media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. Podcasting itself is described as "networking on steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:38">[01:39:38]</a>.

## The Principle of Giving Back

A core tenet of building a strong network and fostering [[the_importance_of_support_and_relationships_in_entrepreneurship | support]] in the industry is the concept of "paying it forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. Choy emphasizes that "if you're helpful to enough people over time you will have access to wealth creation opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. This involves:
*   **Building Reputation** The entire Angel Investing and Venture business revolves around "building your reputation as someone who's helpful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **Active Support** This means being "in the trenches with the founders" and helping them with various challenges, such as navigating complex conversations, onboarding total value locked (TVL), closing senior hires, securing investors, and handling legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.
*   **Planting Karma** "You just kind of try to help people without expectation of returns and you try to plant Karma everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. An example of this is a friend referring an early deal (1inch) that became Choy's first Angel check, teaching him invaluable lessons about Angel Investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

### Givers vs. Takers

Drawing on Adam Grant's "give and take" theory, Choy highlights that "matchers" – people who both give and take – tend to "progress the furthest" and have the best personal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>. In contrast, "takers," who only seek to extract value without reciprocation, "tend to not do so well over the long term" in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>. People can "sense falseness if you're trying to calculate every relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>.

The Chinese business concept of "Guanxi" emphasizes cultivating relationships over many years before seeking any benefit, contrasting with those who instantly ask for things after a brief connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.

## Personal Fulfillment and Team Building

Beyond professional gains, providing value and building strong relationships also contributes to personal fulfillment. Identifying "what aspects of the game gives you fulfillment" and focusing on those areas, while delegating tasks that cause stress, is a "hidden Alpha" for any business, crypto or otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>.

For a fund to succeed, it doesn't need individuals to be good at everything. Instead, it needs to attract people who excel in different areas and build a team around complementary strengths. For example, at Tangent, Choy enjoys brainstorming with founders, while his partner excels at liquid markets trading, allowing them to balance each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.

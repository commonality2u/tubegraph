Andre Cronje, a prominent software developer and entrepreneur known for creating the Yearn Finance protocol, has faced numerous challenges and experienced significant regrets throughout his crypto journey, primarily stemming from his unique development philosophy and the evolving nature of the crypto audience.

## Early Skepticism and Entry into Crypto
Initially, Andre Cronje entered the crypto space as a skeptic. He started by performing code reviews on projects, often publishing his findings publicly, to debunk claims made by various blockchain initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. He found that approximately 99.9999% of projects were "complete garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. However, a small fraction (around 0.1%) of projects showed genuine potential, convincing him that there was "actually something here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

In 2017-2018, his Medium blog, where he published his code reviews, was banned for promoting cryptocurrency content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. This led him to join Crypto Briefing, a media company, where he continued his code review work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Challenges with Phantom
Cronje's deep involvement in crypto began with the original Phantom team. He was initially asked to perform a code review, but upon visiting their offices, he discovered they had no actual code or engineers, only a theoretical idea and raised funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Their core idea was a "plagiarized Hashgraph" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, which was not viable for a public blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Despite this, Andre semi-agreed to help them build a team and get the project off the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

A significant [[challenges_and_mistakes_in_crypto_investing | challenge]] was the mismanagement of funds by the original team. Of the $40 million they raised, a large portion was lost due to the depreciation of Ethereum (from $1,000 to $80) and excessive spending on conferences, sponsorships, and parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. By the time Andre fully took over the treasury management, only about $2 million remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

## Yearn Finance and the Burden of Influence
Andre developed Yearn Finance (YFI) as an accidental solution to manage Phantom's treasury more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. He automated the process of finding the best interest rates across DeFi lending markets, evolving from a static page to a system where anyone could deposit and the system would rebalance automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

A key regret for Andre stems from his non-money-motivated philosophy. He issued 100% of the Yearn tokens (YFI) to the community, with the goal of incentivizing them to take over the protocol as he wanted to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. He believed that if he retained even 1% of the tokens, people would expect him to continue doing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. This decision meant he had no financial upside, yet he still bore the immense responsibility and public expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

## Eminence and the Cost of Public Expectation
The Eminence incident was a major "wakeup call" for Andre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. He had launched a theoretical framework for gaming NFTs, part of his on-chain iterative development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. However, the public misunderstood this as a finished product and deposited $16 million into the contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. The contract was then exploited, with $8 million returned and another $8 million still held by the exploiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

This incident highlighted the drastic change in the crypto audience. Early participants understood his iterative development process and the immutability of his contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. However, by the time of Eminence, a large active audience was unaware of his methods, leading to "expectation management" becoming an exhausting part of his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## Solidly and the False Assumption of Rational Actors
With Solidly, Andre again faced [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | challenges]] related to public expectations and the perceived "bug." The "bug" was actually a design feature of the immutable protocol, allowing a malicious actor to create a "bricked pool" that only they could farm, thereby devaluing the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. Andre had written about this theoretical vulnerability in his Medium articles, believing "no one would do that because you'd be shooting yourself in the foot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

> [!NOTE] False Assumption
> Andre learned that his assumption that "all participants in a system are rational actors" was false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. Two different people exploited this design feature on day one, spending millions to acquire something they then devalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. This was a "good lesson" for him, and he now designs systems that do not assume rational actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

His departure from the Solidly project was misinterpreted as a reaction to this "bug," but he stated that he had made it clear the protocol was immutable and he would no longer be involved after launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. The timing was complicated by the SEC ramping up investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.

## The Mental Toll and Evolving Philosophy
The immense influence he gained over people's money, exemplified by Solidly's $2.3 billion TVL, brought significant stress and anxiety due to the "responsibility of the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. While he ensured his projects underwent multiple audits and rigorous testing, the scale of potential loss was overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. He admits that coping with this pressure became easier over time, as he "get[s] used to the quantity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.

Andre's experience led to a profound shift in his view of human nature. Previously, he believed "all humans are inherently good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>. However, he now believes that "all humans are that's how I like to think and only act good if there is self-interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. This philosophical shift, while hard-won through "depression, hardship, like self-destructive tendencies," has paradoxically made his life "significantly easier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.

He recounts experiences of giving money away to friends and family or to startups with cool ideas, always without formal agreements. In every instance, he experienced negative outcomes: people hated him when he stopped giving, claimed full credit if successful and refused to give back, or simply scammed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>. This "100% hit rate" reinforced his new belief, leading him to stop such actions entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. Ironically, he notes he was scammed more in traditional finance (TradFi) than in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

## Interactions with the SEC
Andre has received "frequent" emails and letters from the SEC, which he describes as "requests for information" under the guise of avoiding an official investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>. The requests for detail were "comprehensive," taking up "days then weeks then months" of his time to collect information, often information he didn't even possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.

> [!WARNING] SEC Tactics
> Andre likens the SEC's approach to tax agencies, stating they convey: "we know everything, but we're going to not tell you and you need to now give us everything and then we're going to compare and if it's wrong, you're going to end up in jail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. He felt they were asking questions until he made a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.

Initially, the focus was on the Yearn token (YFI) â€“ "what investors did I have what seed was there who did I sell it to how much did I have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. This often involved the difficult task of proving a negative, like proving he didn't hold any tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. When that avenue proved difficult, the SEC "scope crept" to claim that Yearn vaults themselves were securities, as users deposited money with an "expectation of return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This ongoing process only stopped when the next election approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

Despite being a South African citizen who had never been to the US and who didn't sell tokens or provide services directly, Andre faced the threat of "extradition" if he didn't comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>. He chose "not to test that theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>. His [[andre_cronjes_experience_with_the_sec | experience with the SEC]] was a significant factor in his decision to step back from public crypto involvement.

## Return to Crypto with Sonic
After a period of stepping back from public crypto, Andre found he "could never stop thinking about... problems I want to solve" in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. He transitioned back to full-time crypto work, though he remains off Twitter to avoid the "noise and toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

He is now focused on Sonic, describing it as "currently the best blockchain tech out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. Sonic, a migration from Phantom, boasts the fastest consensus, lowest time-to-finality (sub-200 milliseconds), and fastest read/writes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>. It can theoretically handle up to 400,000 transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>.

Crucially, Sonic is designed from a decentralized application (DApp) developer's perspective, incorporating features like:
-   **Fee monetization:** 90% of transaction fees go to the DApp that generated them, providing a revenue stream and allowing for user subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
-   **Fee subsidies:** DApps can subsidize user transactions, removing the barrier of needing a wallet or gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
-   **Native account abstraction with economic abstraction:** Users can access DApps using familiar login methods (Google, email, fingerprint) without needing to know about Sonic or its token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

These features intentionally add overhead, making the blockchain technically slower, but prioritize user experience (UX) to drive adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. Andre believes UX/UI is "everything" for the success of blockchain applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. His current plans also involve launching new projects under a company banner with equity and tokens for himself, aligning incentives differently than his previous immutable primitives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. He attributes his ability to risk launching new products to a "more positive administration" in the US, finally providing a path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

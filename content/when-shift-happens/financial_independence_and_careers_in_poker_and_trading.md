His journey highlights various aspects of [[financial_and_personal_growth_overcoming_challenges_and_learning_from_mistakes | financial and personal growth, overcoming challenges, and learning from mistakes]], particularly in high-stakes environments.

## Early Life and Path to Financial Independence

Jordy Alexander was born with significant intelligence, quickly solving problems and learning things, a trait that became intertwined with his self-identity from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. His parents, both Harvard PhDs and university professors, made a remarkable leap from their farming grandparents, but lacked emotional sophistication and financial guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. This upbringing led to a turbulent childhood, including a move from the US to Cyprus at 13-14, where he faced bullying and cultural adaptation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. This period, and his parents' divorce, contributed to significant depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a> and led him to develop his ego as a defense mechanism, overcompensating for insecurities by appearing overconfident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

### Professional Poker Career
Alexander discovered a natural talent for games and probability, excelling in chess, bridge, and eventually poker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. In college in the US, he played poker extensively, earning enough money to pay his own tuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. This financial independence allowed him to cut ties with his controlling father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

Poker provided invaluable training for his future in trading by fostering a process-oriented mindset focused on expected value and probabilities, rather than emotional reactions to wins or losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>. He regularly competes in high-stakes poker, including the World Series of Poker, using these experiences to refine his [[decision_making_and_market_success_in_crypto_investing | decision-making]] in business and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

However, Alexander realized that poker had a "scalability problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. While he could earn a significant hourly wage, it was still an exchange of time for money that wouldn't scale indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. He also observed the dangers of gambling addiction, recalling an instance where a player lost nearly all of $300,000 winnings due to irrational decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. He concluded that humans are "not adapted to dealing with games of chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a>, often relying on superstitions rather than pure randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

## Transition to Trading and Entrepreneurship

After a significant breakup at 26, which led to a period of deep depression and financial liquidation, Alexander sought a more fulfilling life path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>. An almost fatal car crash served as a "wakeup call" to address his mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:53">[02:22:53]</a>. He realized the importance of systematic approaches and controlling his ego, something he lacked at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>.

He pursued an MBA in Singapore to clear his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. Despite excelling in McKinsey interviews, he was advised to pursue finance due to his personality, which aligned with his trading intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>. He initially resisted trading due to its proximity to poker, but ultimately "gave in" to this calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>.

He entered systematic trading, a field dominated by MIT computer science graduates, despite having no coding experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. He chose this path for its scalability potential, allowing algorithms to generate returns without constant manual input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. His unique strength was combining trading intuition with a systematic approach, enabling him to identify opportunities to increase profit and loss (P&L) that pure quants might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

After several years at a large HFT (High-Frequency Trading) firm, where he learned the intricacies of building a team from scratch, he decided to start his own firm in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>. This decision was driven by a desire for growth, to control the culture of the organization, and a belief in his ability to combine strong trading skills with leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. Leaving a $1 million-a-year salary to start from zero required significant self-belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>. Having financial security (a few million dollars) was crucial, allowing him to take on more risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. This reflects [[strategies_for_achieving_financial_freedom_in_the_crypto_space | strategies for achieving financial freedom in the crypto space]] and beyond, where financial independence provides the freedom to pursue higher-impact ventures.

## Selini Capital and High-Stakes Crypto Trading

At Selini Capital, Alexander initially focused on generating P&L to grow the team. He discovered a unique "Futures roll" trade that leveraged his intuition and required piecing together information from multiple sources, making it difficult for algorithms to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. This manual, discretionary trade could yield around $1 million per week during its quarterly availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>.

To execute this trade perfectly, Alexander would have to stay awake for five straight days, taking only short naps, pushing himself to the brink of his physical and mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. This commitment, requiring extreme focus and resilience, demonstrates the [[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_financial_investment_and_entrepreneurship | challenges and responsibilities in financial investment and entrepreneurship]] and the intense [[mental_health_challenges_in_highstakes_trading | mental health challenges in high-stakes trading]]. He saw this as a necessary sacrifice to fund the business's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

### Valuing Time Over Money
After years of performing this physically demanding trade, Alexander made a significant shift in his values. In the current year, he decided to stop doing the "Futures roll" trade, concluding that his time and health were more valuable than the potential $1 million per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. This reflects a deeper understanding of [[balancing_professional_success_with_personal_life | balancing professional success with personal life]] and the diminishing marginal utility of wealth. He views his time as highly valuable, seeking conversations and opportunities that yield significant returns, whether monetary or strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>.

Alexander also reflects on the potential pitfalls of becoming wealthy too quickly, especially for young individuals in crypto, noting that sudden immense wealth can "mess with your mind" and lead to a loss of drive and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>. He emphasizes that for him, the meaning of life isn't about chasing a specific monetary number or title, but about continuous growth, progression, and having a positive impact on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. He seeks the "deeper satisfaction of achieving something that's very hard to do that has impact on the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.

### Views on Crypto Valuation
Alexander distinguishes between two types of value in crypto:
*   **Cash flow value**: Applicable to protocols like Maker that generate real earnings, allowing for traditional valuation metrics like P/E ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.
*   **Monetary premium value**: This is poorly understood, even in traditional markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36">[01:26:36]</a>. Alexander argues that attributing high monetary value to cryptocurrencies without fair distribution (e.g., concentrated supply in a few hands) is akin to "slavery," as it grants immense power to holders over populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>. He sees Bitcoin as an exception due to its philosophical origins and neutrality, making it a more credible alternative currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>. His perspective highlights the [[the_significance_of_valuebased_investing_and_financial_literacy | significance of value-based investing and financial literacy]] in the crypto space.

## Life Philosophy and Personal Growth
Alexander's personal journey has been marked by a constant pursuit of self-improvement and a desire to overcome insecurities. He advises his younger self to "deconstruct the ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>, stressing the importance of humility and building a solid foundation rather than seeking external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:42">[01:31:42]</a>. He believes that true progress comes from being better today than yesterday, rather than constantly comparing oneself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. His current drive is to continue growing and improving himself and those around him, a philosophy that extends beyond financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>.

Pendle Finance, a decentralized project pioneering yield tokenization on Ethereum, allows users to trade and earn fixed yield on their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Founded in 2020, Pendle has undergone significant evolution in its product and market strategies to achieve its current prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

## Early Challenges and V1 (2020-2021)

Pendle's journey began with its V1 launch in June 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This initial version faced considerable challenges:
*   **High Gas Fees**: An end-to-end transaction could cost a user around $1,000 in gas fees due to the initial assumption that "everything should be onchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   **Complex UI/UX**: The product was complex, making the learning curve very steep for most users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The UI/UX was largely copied from existing, established protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound, without specific data points for Pendle's unique mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.
*   **Market Conditions**: Launching during a bull market meant competing for attention against protocols offering high floating rates (20-30% APY), making Pendle's fixed rates (around 10%) less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.
*   **Low Adoption**: V1 struggled to gain traction, leading to low Total Value Locked (TVL), with an initial FdV of about $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.

## Strategic Shifts and V2 (December 2022 - Present)

A significant turning point for Pendle came with the realizations from the DeFi Summer of 2020, where products like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound took 2-3 years to achieve product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This led to a key insight: perseverance is crucial, and products need time to mature and find their fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. The team became determined not to repeat past mistakes, such as leaving [[Challenges and Strategies in Founding Spartan Group | Kyber]] early due to perceived low traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

Pendle V2 was launched in December 2022, incorporating crucial strategic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>:

### Core Strategies for V2
*   **Iterative Product Development**: The team focused on continuous improvement, interacting with end-users to gather data points and refine the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Business Development (BD) & Growth**: A major emphasis was placed on BD and growth efforts, differentiating V2 from V1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Simplified Learning Curve**: Extensive investment was made in educational materials to make Pendle more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution Focus**: Recognizing that even great technology needs distribution, Pendle prioritized working on distribution outlets and getting people to talk about the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This aligns with the Silicon Valley saying: "First-time founders focus on the product, second-time founders focus on the distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Narrative Positioning**: Pendle adopted a strategy of identifying and leveraging major liquidity flows and market narratives, similar to macro traders identifying central bank policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Growth and Traction

In early 2023, Pendle was at a low point, with its token at 3 cents and single-digit TVL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The protocol gained significant momentum through several key factors:

*   **Early Boost from Key Figures**: The first major boost came when Alex Volkov publicly bought Pendle tokens, instilling confidence in the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Liquid Staking Tokens (LST) Narrative**: Identifying LSTs as a dominant trend, Pendle affiliated its brand with leading players like Lido, Rocket Pool, Balancer, and Aura, collectively marketing new product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Re-staking Narrative and Points System**: This became the main catalyst for Pendle's product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.
    *   Pendle had prior experience with points systems through its work with Swell, an LSD protocol that issued "pearls" (points) for liquidity incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.
    *   EigenLayer popularized the points system further, offering points to early depositors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.
    *   Pendle partnered with Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) protocols like Ether.fi, Renzo, and Kelp, which are built on EigenLayer and also offer points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.
    *   Pendle strategically assigned all points to its Yield Token (YT) and negotiated for point multipliers (e.g., 3x points for deposits through Pendle), funneling significant liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.
*   **Ethena's Contribution**: Ethena's rise played a big role in Pendle's growth, with Ethena actively seeking partnerships to accept USDe as a deposit asset for points campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

### Pendle's Mechanics and Current Scale

[[Pendle Finance and its Yield Tokenization | Pendle]] operates as an interest rate swap protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. It tokenizes yield-bearing assets (like ETH) into two components:
*   **Principal Token (PT)**: Represents the underlying principal and offers a fixed rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>.
*   **Yield Token (YT)**: Represents the future yield and accumulates points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.
One PT plus one YT equals the value of the underlying asset, making them inversely related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>. Users bullish on protocol performance and points buy YT, while those seeking fixed rates buy PT (structured like a zero-coupon bond) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. This allows for attractive fixed APYs, sometimes as high as 40-60% on ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.

Pendle's growth has been exponential:
*   **TVL**: Grew from $5 million at the start of 2023 to peaking at $250 million, and is currently approaching $7 billion, largely due to re-staking protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **FDV**: Increased from $10 million to approximately $1.5-$1.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.
*   **Transactions**: Daily transactions soared from roughly one every two days to thousands per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.
*   **Daily Trading Volume**: Increased from $200-$300K to an average of $100-$200 million this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
Pendle has even surpassed major protocols like Compound in TVL, a significant milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. High-profile users like Justin Sun have been observed utilizing Pendle for fixed rates on large sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

## Future Potential

Pendle is actively pursuing several avenues for continued growth:

*   **Re-staking Dominance**: The re-staking narrative is considered "very sound" as it allows users to generate more yield with the same asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>. Pendle aims to be a facilitator of liquidity to re-staking protocols like Karak and Symbiotic, with a market potential of tens of billions of dollars in TVL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. The belief is that most users will eventually prefer staking assets in re-staking protocols for optimized returns, depending on their risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin Ecosystem**: Pendle is deeply exploring the Bitcoin ecosystem, believing there's a demand to make dormant Bitcoin more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. With Bitcoin being the largest asset, even capturing 1% of its market value (tens of billions of dollars) would be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.
*   **New Product Development**: Pendle is working on a new product that is expected to be "game-changing" by enabling new use cases not currently possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>.

Pendle's success is attributed to its iterative product development, strong focus on business development, strategic narrative positioning, and commitment to building a platform that helps other protocols go to market and bootstrap initial traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.

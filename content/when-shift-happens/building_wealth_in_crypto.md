The fundamental question for newcomers to the crypto space is often: how can one [[how_to_get_rich_in_crypto_without_getting_lucky | get rich in crypto without getting lucky]] and without falling for scams? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> The answer, though simple, is not always easy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

## Initial Steps: Bitcoin and Dollar-Cost Averaging
The initial advice for anyone entering the crypto space is to buy Bitcoin and [[investment_strategies_in_crypto_markets | dollar-cost average]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This involves buying a set amount with each paycheck and holding it to gain a feel for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Initially, this advice is often given during a rising market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, new investors must then experience market corrections, where assets can drop by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Navigating these corrections is part of the learning curve, after which individuals typically become accustomed and "numb" to the market's volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Expanding Beyond Bitcoin: The "Danger Zone"
Once comfortable with Bitcoin, investors often seek more speculative opportunities to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. While Bitcoin is considered digital gold and a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, its potential gains (e.g., 2x from $100K to $200K) may not seem sufficient to those seeking quick wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Historically, Bitcoin has delivered impressive returns, averaging 150% since 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

However, the allure of other crypto projects promising 100x returns can lead investors into a "danger zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This is when individuals might go "all in" on risky assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Managing Speculative Investments
To mitigate risk when exploring more speculative assets, it's advised to allocate only a small portion, such as 10%, of your portfolio to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This approach allows for learning without catastrophic losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Meme coins, for instance, have an estimated 85% probability of going to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Even assets that experience significant crashes, like Luna, don't necessarily go to zero instantly; they can gradually decline, leading to prolonged losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Meme Coins
> Meme coins are highly volatile and primarily driven by social media narratives rather than fundamental technology. Investors often "switch from one narrative to the other at narrative peak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, which can lead to losses if not timed perfectly.

## The Importance of Portfolio Allocation and Risk Management
A critical lesson in [[strategies_for_achieving_financial_freedom_in_the_crypto_space | building wealth with crypto]] is the importance of portfolio allocation and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. These "boring concepts" become crucial when the market experiences significant downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. For example, being heavily leveraged in a crash can lead to losing all crypto holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

With proper asset allocation and risk management, navigating market downturns can feel like "a walk in the park," allowing focus on other productive activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Navigating Risks in the Crypto Space
The crypto space is fraught with numerous risks, necessitating a constant state of paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Yield-Seeking Dangers
A common pitfall is seeking high yield on crypto assets. Lending assets on DeFi protocols for yield can lead to immediate loss if something goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The pursuit of even a small percentage of yield, like 6%, can expose an investor to an unknown percentage chance of losing all capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

While new narratives like "Bitcoin DeFi" and Bitcoin staking are emerging, promising yield on Bitcoin, many professionals advise against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The argument is that the potential capital gains from Bitcoin itself are so substantial that chasing an extra few percent in yield is not worth the risk of losing the "pristine collateral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

> [!TIP] Professional vs. Retail Products
> Complex yield enhancement products, such as those involving yield curve mismatches or staking aggregators like Lido, are often better suited for professionals who understand the intricate risks, counterparty risks, and liquidity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. For the average person, the allure of high yields (e.g., 20%) can obscure significant, unknown risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Security and Custody Risks
Another significant risk is security, including wallet hygiene and hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Users must understand how to keep assets in different wallets and never expose key wallets to direct interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Impersonation scams (e.g., people impersonating individuals or exchanges like Coinbase online) are also rampant, with bad actors constantly trying to steal money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## The Importance of Paranoia
Maintaining a paranoid mindset, constantly considering what could go wrong, helps prevent complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This vigilance is crucial because for many, their crypto holdings represent their life savings and are the most important aspect of their financial lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. By managing risk and avoiding greed, individuals can ensure that "time will take care of itself" as the market matures and the technology is adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Ryan Kim, founding partner at Hash, a global early-stage venture fund, believes that blockchain and cryptocurrency are pioneering the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Hash aims to provide founders with tools as an "alternative VC system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Hash's Entry into the Crypto Space

Ryan Kim and his co-founders started as individual investors in 2016, studying Ethereum and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. When the crypto boom arrived in 2017, they gathered high-profile individuals, developers, founders, conglomerates, and venture capitalists in Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. They evangelized that blockchain was the future and encouraged investment in crypto companies and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Having an engineering and entrepreneur background, Kim realized blockchain would be a "heaven for data scientists" as all data is open on the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

The initial idea was to build a community and share their passion for blockchain, which they believed would change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This community grew sizable, granting them access to deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Founders were very satisfied with the community activities, leading them to offer allocations, and Hash spontaneously became private sale investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Focus on Gaming and Mass Adoption

Kim believes that the [[the_evolution_of_the_gaming_industry_through_blockchain | gaming sector]] will be the first to achieve mass adoption in blockchain, drawing a parallel to the internet era where addictive yet entertaining services (like gambling or games) led the way before broader applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.

In 2019, Hash decided to open "Hash Labs," a temporary incubation team, specifically to invest in gaming companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. They invested in eight gaming companies, including:
*   Axie Infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>
*   The Sandbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>
*   Mythical Games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>
*   Node Games (Korean company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>

Four out of these eight investments became unicorns, indicating a high success ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. Hash was the first check investor for both Axie Infinity and The Sandbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

### Key Factors for Success in Gaming Investments

When identifying potential "winners" in blockchain projects, Kim emphasizes user activity and the number of onboarded users over metrics like FTV or valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. For gaming, he notes that Asian founders are "very flexible," adapting to recent trends, learning from customers and the community, and adjusting their strategy to fit the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>.

In web3, the focus shifts from a purely product-driven approach (common in web2) to a [[digital_asset_policies_and_the_future_of_web_3_gaming | community-driven model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. Web3 projects prioritize sharing their vision and product benefits with the community, engaging with investors and potential investors in conferences and on social media to build a bigger community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.

### Ronin Network and its Potential

The Ronin Network team is highly regarded for its balanced leadership and strong experience in building successful games, such as Axie Infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. Key strengths include:
*   **Infrastructure and Toolkit:** Ronin provides a strong infrastructure and toolkit specifically for games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>.
*   **User Base:** It has a substantial user base, with approximately 700,000 daily active users, making it the third-largest L1 in terms of active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.
*   **Marketing Expertise:** The team understands how to effectively market games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

## Bridging Traditional IP with Blockchain

Hash is actively working to bring mainstream intellectual property (IP) from Japanese anime and Korean pop (K-pop) into the blockchain space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

### Anime
*   **Kasak Labo:** A Singaporean portfolio company of Hash, Kasak Labo acquired a Japanese anime studio (Najja Studio), which is closely connected to top anime studios in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.
*   **Anime Chain:** There are ongoing efforts to launch an "anime chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. The high viewership and dedicated fan base of Japanese anime, who buy merchandise and engage deeply with content, suggest they could form their own networks on blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. The goal is to onboard top-tier Japanese IP to the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>.

### K-pop
*   **Mood House:** Hash's studio initiated a K-pop entertainment company called Mood House, which manages two idol groups, Trip S and EMIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>.
*   **Fan Engagement:** K-pop has a global audience, and blockchain can revolutionize fan engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. Fans can buy [[cryptocurrencies_and_nfts_in_gaming | NFTs]] or governance tokens related to K-pop groups or anime IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>. This allows fans to "own" a part of the IP, encouraging them to invest more resources and effort into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   **Funding and Upside:** This model could also enable fans to fund new IPs (e.g., emerging singers or bands) and participate in their financial upside if they become successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.

This integration of popular culture with blockchain through NFTs and governance tokens is seen as a "game changer" for fan engagement and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

## Future of Mass Adoption

Beyond specific sectors like gaming and entertainment, Ryan Kim believes that mass adoption will come through the integration of wallets into widely used services like Telegram or Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. This would allow users to spontaneously create wallets, easily transfer money, and connect to other web3 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. This approach leverages existing user bases and simplifies the user experience, making crypto more accessible to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.

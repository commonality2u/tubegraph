The traditional mobile gaming market, particularly its free-to-play model, is encountering significant [[Challenges in the crypto industry | challenges]] that are forcing studios to seek new approaches, including Web3 technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## High Barrier to Entry
It requires substantial marketing investment, often seven to eight figures, for a new game to even hope to enter the top-grossing charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The top-grossing charts have remained largely unchanged for years, indicating a lack of new entrants, which is unhealthy for a market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Creator Engagement and Revenue Sharing Difficulties
Previously, platforms struggled to keep creators engaged for more than a few months or years. Social fame alone was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A key problem in Web2 was the inability to share revenue with creators, despite their content contributing to a game's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Mobile platforms like the App Store and Google Play take a significant fee (5-30%) on user purchases, and developers lack a direct, scalable way to send payments back to individual users or creators on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Challenged User Acquisition Model (CPI vs. LTV)
The traditional business model in mobile gaming, relying on the Cost Per Install (CPI) versus Lifetime Value (LTV) equation, is now facing significant difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Increased Costs and Decreased Revenue
*   **Privacy Laws:** New privacy laws prevent stores and platforms from collecting specific user data, making it difficult to efficiently target users. This has led to a rise in user acquisition costs (CPI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Economic Context:** Global inflation and conflicts mean people are spending less on entertainment, resulting in a decrease in Lifetime Value (LTV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

The combination of rising CPI and decreasing LTV makes it increasingly challenging for studios to remain profitable, leading to an unprecedented number of layoffs in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Resistance to Change from Established Players
Large Web2 gaming companies are often the last to adopt new platforms and models like Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. While Web3 offers potential earnings, the daily revenue they already generate in Web2 is often sufficient, providing little incentive to risk their existing, highly profitable models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Some larger studios are establishing new, more agile entities to experiment with Web3, allowing them to be creative without the rigid corporate structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Web3 is seen as an opportunity to reinvent the monetization model, distribute value more fairly among players, developers, and platforms, and involve the community as stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This requires education, adaptation, and experimentation to find new major models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

[[mechanics_of_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] is a key platform within the Terra ecosystem, known for offering an approximate 20% annual percentage rate (APR) on stablecoin deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Understanding how Anchor can sustain this yield and whether it will continue to do so is crucial for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The protocol's whitepaper provides detailed information on its workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## How Anchor Protocol Generates Yield

[[mechanics_of_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] generates its yield primarily from two sources: the interest earned on collateral assets deposited by borrowers, and the interest paid by borrowers on their loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Breakdown of Yield Generation (as of November 23, 2021)

To assess sustainability, one must consider the payout requirements versus the revenue generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

*   **Total Deposits to Pay Out**: Anchor Protocol had 2.42 billion UST in total deposits, requiring an annual payout of 471.4 million UST at a 19.8% interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

*   **Income from Collateralized Assets**:
    *   Borrowers on [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] must post collateral, typically over-collateralized, in assets like bonded Luna (bLuna) and bonded Ethereum (bETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Anchor stakes these collateralized assets in DeFi protocols (e.g., Lido) to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   **bLuna**: With 2.76 billion UST worth of bLuna deposited, earning 6.3% via Lido Finance, Anchor generates 173.8 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   **bETH**: With 373 million UST worth of bETH deposited, earning 4.9% via Lido, Anchor generates 18.3 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

*   **Income from Borrowed Funds**:
    *   The current amount of UST borrowed against collateral in Anchor is 1.21 billion UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   The interest (borrow APR) on these funds generates 283.14 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Net Yield Calculation

Adding these revenue streams:
173.8 million UST (bLuna) + 18.3 million UST (bETH) + 283.14 million UST (borrowed funds) = **475.24 million UST total earned revenue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Comparing this to the 471.4 million UST required for payouts, Anchor Protocol was generating a surplus of 3.84 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### The Yield Reserve

This surplus revenue flows into the **Yield Reserve** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The Yield Reserve acts as a buffer to cover any imbalances or shortfalls when the borrow APR is insufficient to cover the required payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. As of the video's recording, the yield reserve stood at approximately 75 million UST and was consistently growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The continuous growth of this reserve indicates the protocol's ability to sustain its high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## [[role_of_anchor_token_in_yield_generation | Role of Anchor Token (ANC)]]

The Anchor Token (ANC) is the governance token for [[mechanics_of_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. ANC tokens are distributed to borrowers to offset the borrow APR, sometimes even resulting in a net positive APR, meaning users are paid to borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This distribution serves as an incentivization program to encourage platform usage and is slated to continue until the end of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of Terra Network]]

[[mechanics_of_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] has positioned itself as a fundamental component of the Terra network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Numerous projects are being developed either on top of Anchor or as plugins that integrate with its functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. These integrations are facilitating real-world adoption and cross-chain interconnectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **Orion Protocol**: Uses Anchor as a backbone to earn yields. Users can deposit ERC-20 tokens into Orion, which then, via smart contracts, uses Anchor to earn yield on their behalf, offering exposure to non-native savings platforms for users on Polygon, Ethereum, and BSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Orca from Kujira**: Has developed a mechanism for retail users to participate in Anchor's [[understanding_anchor_protocol_and_its_liquidations | liquidations contract]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Cash DeFi**: Aims to bring stablecoins to the masses by allowing users to open savings accounts with IBANs, sort codes, and debit cards to spend UST in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Conclusion: Sustainability Outlook

Based on the analysis, [[mechanics_of_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] demonstrates the capability to sustain its 20% yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Its yield generation mechanisms, incentive structures, increasing adoption (evidenced by new wallet creation on Terra Station), and a growing yield reserve collectively support the continuation of these high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

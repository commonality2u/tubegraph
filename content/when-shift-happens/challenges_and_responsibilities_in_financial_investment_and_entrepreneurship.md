The **[[Challenges and responsibilities in financial investment and entrepreneurship | challenges and responsibilities in financial investment and entrepreneurship]]** encompass not only financial outcomes but also personal well-being, societal impact, and the underlying motivations behind entrepreneurial and investment pursuits. This article explores insights from Anthony, co-founder of SwissBorg, on his [[Entrepreneurial journey and challenges | entrepreneurial journey]], the philosophy of wealth, and critiques of traditional finance and venture capital.

## Anthony's [[Entrepreneurial journey and challenges | Entrepreneurial Journey]]

Anthony is a French entrepreneur and co-founder of SwissBorg, a crypto wealth management company based in Switzerland, which was started six years ago and currently serves over 1 million users actively investing in crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

### Early Life and Career Path
Anthony grew up moving around France due to his mother's government work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>. His mother, who was the family's breadwinner, recognized his talent for math, leading him to an engineering school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:09">[02:30:09]</a>. After five years of engineering studies, he sought an exciting career with titles and pursued finance for ten years, working in Paris and then London, which he considered the "core of what Finance is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:04">[02:37:04]</a>.

### Dissatisfaction with Traditional Finance
Despite achieving titles and an "amazing life" with a good job and beautiful house, Anthony felt "very very lonely inside" and increasingly distant from himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:53">[02:39:53]</a>. He did not connect with the people he worked with or the daily operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>. His naive vision of finance as a tool for collaboration was challenged by its micro-level operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>.

### Transition to Crypto and Founding SwissBorg
After ten years in finance, Anthony quit his job in London and returned to his mother's home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>. He co-founded a company similar to SwissBorg but without crypto, which eventually was acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>. His introduction to crypto began in late 2016 when a colleague urged him to look into Dash, which was touted as "the next Bitcoin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. Initially skeptical due to his investment background, viewing Bitcoin as volatile and unregulated, he eventually tried to buy Dash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>. After realizing how difficult it was to acquire crypto, he began connecting daily to CoinMarketCap, understanding the underlying technology, and discovering the "magic" of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.

He reconnected with his friend Cyrus, who would become his co-founder, in Switzerland, which was then a "bedrock of crypto" with a burgeoning ecosystem and supportive regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. They decided to create SwissBorg and, a year later, raised $50 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in early 2018, just before a market crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Wealth and Purpose

### Money vs. Inner Happiness
There is a widespread obsession with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. However, accumulating a lot of money quickly, especially in crypto, will lead to experiences at a materialistic level that quickly become normal and do not solve internal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:07">[08:04:07]</a>. Studies suggest that the happiness from winning the lottery, for example, lasts about six months to a year, after which individuals return to their baseline happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:17">[08:46:17]</a>. No amount of money can compensate for deep-seated insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:46">[07:00:46]</a>.

### The Illusion of Materialistic Success
People who appear to have succeeded materially often realize that money does not make up for internal emptiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>. The pursuit of external recognition, titles, and material possessions can lead to feeling "trapped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>. The time it takes to realize this loss of connection with oneself can be prolonged by accumulating family, a house, and a mortgage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:58">[02:00:58]</a>.

### Finding Purpose
Money should be seen as a consequence of a higher goal, rather than an end in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:30">[09:51:30]</a>. A purposeful life, aligning with one's intrinsic values, can naturally lead to financial success without significant struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:02">[09:40:02]</a>. The philosophy "collect memories, not money" encapsulates this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:42">[01:06:11]</a>. Anthony believes his purpose is to help others unlock their immense potential, often by connecting with inspiring individuals, as knowledge truly comes from experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[01:06:28]</a>.

### The Importance of Feedback
In periods of success, especially during a bull market, founders might become "cocky" and less receptive to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. However, this is precisely when feedback is most crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. Conversely, during tough times, individuals are more open to feedback but should instead reconnect with their fundamental values and instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

### Overcoming Self-Doubt and Failure
When faced with significant failures, such as a major loss in crypto, self-doubt can arise, questioning whether success was merely luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.# [[Challenges and responsibilities in financial investment and entrepreneurship]]

### The Importance of Feedback
In periods of success, especially during a bull market, founders might become "cocky" and less receptive to feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. However, this is precisely when feedback is most crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. Conversely, during tough times, individuals are more open to feedback but should instead reconnect with their fundamental values and instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

### Overcoming Self-Doubt and Failure
When faced with significant failures, such as a major loss in crypto, self-doubt can arise, questioning whether success was merely luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. This is a moment to be kind to oneself, disappear from social life, and focus on multiple ventures to see what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. Surrendering control is part of evolving as a human, as life recalls strong personalities who become too confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

### Motivation for Entrepreneurship
The biggest engine of motivation for an entrepreneur is frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. A product should ideally be created for oneself, stemming from a personal journey of discovery and frustration with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>. Entrepreneurship, fundamentally, is about bringing something to the world and solving a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. If the primary motivation is money, it is unlikely one will sustain the journey through tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:57">[01:36:57]</a>. Money should be seen as an external positivity resulting from doing something great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>.

## Critique of Traditional Finance and Venture Capital

### Issues with the VC Investment Model
Anthony views finance as a tool for collaboration, directing collective time and resources to create value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:05">[02:53:05]</a>. However, he generally disagrees with how Venture Capital (VC) firms invest, particularly those whose employees are managing others' money and are primarily concerned with keeping their jobs rather than making the best investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. This leads to a lack of genuine innovation, with many companies resembling existing successful models like Revolut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

He argues that the VC model is "failing 100%" because it doesn't know how to measure new forms of value, such as brand, loyalty, and community, which he considers the true value of modern businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>. Traditional metrics like GDP fail to capture the value of free services like Wikipedia compared to selling encyclopedias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

### Misaligned Incentives and Short-term Thinking
The traditional VC model incentivizes entrepreneurs incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. Many VCs focus on short-term turnover and passing on a company to the next VC at a higher valuation, rather than fostering a good, profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. This results in a significant percentage of listed companies, particularly in the US (50%), being unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. The IPO of Snapchat, which stated it might never be profitable, set a precedent for listing companies without a clear path to profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

Entrepreneurs share responsibility by accepting money that might not align with their values, leading them to chase arbitrary financial targets and lose sight of their initial purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.

### The "Free Rider" Concept in Finance
The concept of a "Free Rider" applies to individuals who want to benefit from a public good without paying for it, often seen in markets where short-term thinking and greed prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>. In crypto, this is exacerbated by people participating in unsustainable projects (e.g., Ponzi schemes) with the belief they are smart enough to exit early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.

This contrasts with investing as a positive-sum game, where long-term thinking and contributing to a "public good" should ideally lead to collective benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>.

### SwissBorg's Approach
SwissBorg intentionally did not raise money from VCs because they wouldn't have been backed then, and Anthony's values don't align with their investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>. This allowed them to prioritize loyalty, community, and transparency. For instance, their "Smart Yield" product, launched in 2020, offered full transparency on where funds were invested, even when competitors offered higher, riskier yields based on traditional finance leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>. This principled stance, while causing a significant drop in assets under management when yields normalized and users chased higher returns elsewhere, ultimately saved SwissBorg from collapse during the market downturns that affected other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.

> "The fact that we are not backed by VC saved [SwissBorg], to be honest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>.

Anthony argues that other companies failed because they hired people from payment companies to "scale" investment businesses, applying a linear growth mindset to non-linear investment dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>.

## The Role of Crypto in Innovation and Mindset Shift

### Accelerating Adoption and Changing Perceptions
Real innovation happens when perception is changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>. Crypto can accelerate this process by incentivizing participation. For example, while it took years for practices like ice baths (advocated by Wim Hof) to gain mainstream acceptance, crypto tokens could instantly incentivize more people to try new experiences, even if initially driven by greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>. This "hacks" the system by appealing to a universal desire for more money or fun, drawing people into a new philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>.

### Beyond Price: Discovering Value in Investment
A major challenge in finance is the overwhelming focus on price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. Fintech needs to reinvent how people discover and engage with investments, shifting away from price-driven decisions to focus on the underlying value, mission, and stories of projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>. For example, people might invest in Bitcoin for the promise of quick riches, but the goal is for them to stay for its philosophical underpinnings as an insurance policy against traditional finance collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>.

The "think big" culture, which often encourages founders to prioritize making a billion over solving a problem, is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:42">[01:32:42]</a>. Instead, entrepreneurs should start with the smallest iteration of a product to build a community based on solving a problem they genuinely care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18">[01:33:18]</a>.

## Personal Responsibility and Well-being

### Lessons from India
Anthony's trip to India, prompted by a desire for a different New Year's Eve experience, led to reflections on his childhood and an important realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>. He realized that his frequent childhood sicknesses were linked to emotional connection to his parents' relational drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. This insight highlighted a "mechanical relationship" with his body, which merely signals what needs to be fixed in the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>.

### Holistic Medicine vs. Traditional Medicine
This experience led to a belief in holistic medicine, which emphasizes the mind-body connection and seeks to address underlying causes rather than just symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>. While traditional medicine can be valuable, he stresses that individuals must retain responsibility for their health decisions and not blindly delegate them to doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:30">[01:57:30]</a>. Holistic practices, like acupuncture or using herbs, often work in ways science cannot fully explain but have thousands of years of tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:24">[01:55:24]</a>.

### Taking Control of One's Health and Life
Anthony emphasizes that true power comes from finding one's own path and connecting to an inner source of strength, rather than relying on external tools or quick fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>.

> "You need to take responsibility for your current health, your current situations. You cannot outsource your health or your finances to someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:22">[01:59:22]</a>.

Life's challenges are often lessons, and accepting this perspective helps overcome feelings of victimhood, leading to personal growth and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>.

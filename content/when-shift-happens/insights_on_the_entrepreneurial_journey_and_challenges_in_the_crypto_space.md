Jensen, co-founder and CEO of Virtuals Protocol, a leading crypto AI agents protocol on Base and Solana, shares his extensive [[entrepreneurial journey and challenges]] and insights into building and managing a business in the crypto industry. His experiences highlight the volatile nature of the crypto space, the importance of resilience, and the strategic decisions required to navigate rapid growth and intense competition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>

## Early Ventures and Lessons Learned

Jensen's [[entrepreneurial journey and lessons learned]] began during his third year at Imperial College London, where he started his first company, a deep tech venture aiming to create an alternative water source through air condensation in high-humidity, water-scarce areas like Yemen or California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Despite securing funding and grants, the project failed due to a critical mistake involving a "wrong external partnership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. From this, Jensen learned the importance of due diligence in partnerships, though he admits the reality is that convenience and velocity often dictate such decisions, especially for small companies where one wrong partnership can be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

His second venture was a digital marketing business in Web2, started with his current co-founder, Wiki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Though profitable, it couldn't scale exponentially due to its linear scaling model, requiring an increase in human capital for growth, which they deemed not a "rocket ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

The third venture was an AI/ML-driven property search platform in Singapore and Malaysia, aiming to revolutionize property search by using big data and AI/ML to provide recommendations instead of traditional search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This project also aimed for speed and velocity, which led to their technical co-founder burning out and leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Jensen highlights the importance of surrounding oneself with a supportive team to share the burden of stress and prevent burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This venture was bootstrapped for six to eight months and closed down when it didn't show the desired hockey stick growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

Jensen and Wiki pursued these ventures while working in management consulting, often putting in 16-18 hour days at BCG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. He even found that doing side projects helped focus on his day job, and during COVID, he juggled management consulting work with manual crypto arbitrage on multiple screens, making hundreds of dollars every 15-50 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Jensen even managed to outsource 70% of his consulting workload to interns he trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of going back to a job after a failed venture, as it's not a shame and often necessary to build a billion-dollar company, which is "not normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. He stresses the need to be "numb to what people think about you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

## The Crypto Entrepreneurship Roller Coaster

Virtuals Protocol's [[entrepreneurial journey and challenges]] truly exemplified the "crypto entrepreneurship roller coaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Starting in early 2023, the initial focus was on decentralized AI infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. This narrative led to a 20x valuation run-up, but lacking fundamental adoption, it fell back to 3x from its lowest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment was the decision to shift focus to the tokenization and co-ownership of AI agents (Version 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This led to a "crazy" 100x run-up in valuation by the end of 2024 (podcast date likely early 2024, implying a projection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. The project went from a 600 million dollar valuation down to 3-6 million dollars, then surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

This massive growth brought new [[challenges and strategies in launching and scaling a crypto startup]], including being on the front page of crypto news, attracting intense public scrutiny, and facing a rush of competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Unlike previous ventures, Virtuals had taken investor money, creating an obligation to retail investors who believed in them, which prevented them from simply relaunching a new token to escape "baggage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

Dealing with FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) and criticism is a constant battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. Jensen's strategy is to respond publicly to critical FUD, but to limit exposure to social media to once a day (around dinner time) to protect his mental well-being and maintain productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. He admits that FUD can significantly impact founders and that he experienced cold sweats and anxiety attacks regularly in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. A major concern for him now is how FUD affects his growing team who may not be as "numb" to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Building and Managing a Team Amidst Hypergrowth

Scaling from 1 to 100, or even 1 to 10,000 in a matter of weeks or months, is a new battlefield for Jensen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Key [[challenges and strategies in launching and scaling a crypto startup]] include designing the organizational structure needed for such growth and hiring rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. Jensen admits that they have been "quite aggressive" in letting go of underperforming team members, learning to "fire fast" to build an "Alpha Team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. This process of letting go of people becomes "numb" after the tenth time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

With a team that recently grew from 25 to 35 core people in one month, rapid hiring is crucial but also risky, with many new hires potentially not working out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. Jensen states that people are the "most important agenda" as they will shape the company in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

## Founder Dedication and Sacrifices

The [[entrepreneurial journey and overcoming industry challenges]] in crypto demand immense dedication. Jensen mortgaged his parents' house to pay off a $300,000 USD scholarship bond to pursue his entrepreneurial path instead of a corporate career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:4:43">[00:4:43]</a>. His early crypto investments from 2016 helped pay it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>.

Wiki, Jensen's co-founder, flew 22 hours for a 15-minute announcement at a Jupiter conference in Istanbul, showcasing the extreme sacrifices founders make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. Jensen highlights that such presence "showcases like you are here for real" and helps form crucial relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:52">[01:23:52]</a>. Founders often have "weird" schedules, sleeping at odd hours to accommodate calls across different time zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. Despite the intensity, Jensen prioritizes 6-8 hours of sleep to make good decisions and maintain his health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.

## Strategic Decisions and Challenges

One of the biggest mistakes was initially trying to protect Luna's (an AI agent) novel autonomous wallet control capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. They decided to slowly democratize it, which "introduced a ton of competitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. Jensen now believes that being more open-source with a managed service model from day one might have reduced competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. However, he reflects that competition can be beneficial, as it helps educate the market faster and expands the "pie" of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.

Virtuals expanded to Solana because of its "lot of liquidity" and the number of builders seeking to launch projects there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. Previously, they focused on Base to "fight the war on one front" and establish themselves as a key winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>. Now, with a mature team, they are expanding to other chains like Saga (gaming), Story (IP), Abstract (consumer), and BTC L2s, each offering a different "edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>.

The challenge of getting a Coinbase listing for Virtuals Protocol illustrates the complexities of the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. Despite strong support from the Base team, there are standard operating procedures and compliance policies that projects must meet, often requiring ongoing refinement of messaging or product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

One of the most intense and craziest decisions was the pivot of Virtuals Protocol, which was not a consensus decision within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. During a bear market, with the treasury at its lowest point, the team debated whether to continue the project or even return funds to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. Jensen strongly disagreed with continuing as a trading fund, believing in the power of riding both the AI and gaming narratives, despite not fully knowing what that would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. This conviction ultimately paid off.

## Future Vision: Sci-Fi Ideas and [[Insights on crypto and technological advances]]

Jensen envisions two key advantages for Virtuals Protocol: an ecosystem of excited builders and a technological edge in autonomous agents performing "autonomous commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a>. He believes Web3 agents can outperform Web2 agents due to their control over permissionless wallets and access to a permissionless economy, which banks would never grant to agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>.

One "sci-fi" experiment they are pursuing is creating a "Zuzalu" – a social economic experiment where developers "co-live together and co-build businesses with these autonomous agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>. This could include autonomous hedge funds or AI agents running concerts, with the goal of proving that the economic output of this micro-society, governed by AI-set policies, "can rival that of some small nations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>.

Other "weird ass ideas" that stem from this nation-state concept include creating a new type of stablecoin backed by "productive intelligence" from revenue-generative agents, allowing agents to issue and collateralize tokens for loans to conduct businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>.

Jensen also discusses the potential for autonomous agents to act as an "Internet Water Army," where human-like AI agents with large follower counts can control narratives on the internet for marketing, PR, or even elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>. This shows the spectrum of potential AI agent use cases.

## [[Entrepreneurship Lessons in the Crypto Space]]: How to Get Rich with Crypto AI Agents Without Getting Lucky

Jensen advises that people need to understand the difference between a "high value agent" and a "commodity agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>. Many agents have "no moat or no value accrual mechanism" and use "very commoditized functions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>.

High-value agents must have an "edge" in terms of:
*   **Model side**: Trained through proprietary Federated learning models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>.
*   **Data side**: Access to exclusive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>.
*   **Action space side**: Unique capabilities or integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

He cites "XBT" as an example of a viral agent that "solves an actual pain point" (what token to buy) and had an "information creation pipeline" built over months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.

> "Don't bet on commodity, bet on something that can be specialized." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a>

An example of a high-value agent is a "sports commentary agent" that, by leveraging proprietary analytics and acting as a sounding board, can then convert user attention into "flows" by convincing them to place bets on a high-target market like sports betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>. This demonstrates how an agent can become a "cash cow agent" by capturing value from attention and converting it into flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:45">[01:40:45]</a>.

Jensen encourages aspiring builders to refer to the thesis on high-value accrual agents on AgentStarter.ai/agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>. He concludes by emphasizing the importance of [[entrepreneurial persistence and success in crypto]] and continuous building, regardless of token price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:12">[01:46:12]</a>.

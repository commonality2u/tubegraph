From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

The traditional structures of education and prevailing societal norms significantly shape, and often limit, an individual's potential. According to entrepreneur and investor Luke Belmar, much of society is conditioned to believe in systems and ideas that are not conducive to true freedom and growth.

## Societal Conditioning and "Fiat Slaves"

Modern individuals are no longer "peasants" but "Fiat slaves," bound to an imaginary concept of money that dictates their lives. This system, with its promise of retirement by age 65 after 40 years of labor, is viewed as a form of enslavement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Historically, peasants in feudal ages only worked around 150 days a year, contrasting sharply with today's "Fiat slaves" who work approximately 300 days a year, assuming money is the most important thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This societal conditioning is designed to keep individuals dependent and fearful of understanding finance, much like religious texts were once kept in Latin to control the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.

### Rejecting the "Matrix" and External Limitations
To escape these limitations, individuals must first understand that they are not defined by religion, parents, friends, or even their own self-perceptions, as human potential is limitless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Living according to the opinions and insecurities of others limits one's true [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | self-development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. If one desires success, they must pay the price through dedicated action, focusing on a few achievable goals rather than many conflicting desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

## The Flaws of the Modern Education System

Belmar argues that university is a "scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>, designed as a business to control access to jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. This system produces individuals with many degrees but little real-world experience, leading to arrogance, entitlement, and a lack of self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. This contributes to "academic inflation," where graduates struggle to find jobs or face low pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

Belmar recalls leaving university because professors lacked real-world experience in their subjects, such as a communications teacher who couldn't articulate well or an international business professor who had never traveled overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.

### The Prussian School System Model
The modern education system, influenced by the Rockefeller Foundation's adoption of the Prussian school system, was designed to create compliant "factory working bots" rather than independent thinkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. Its structure, with bells, assembly lines, and controlled movements, mimics both the industrial era and the prison complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. This conditioning from a young age leads to a fear of failure, as penalties and shaming discourage risk-taking and self-expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.

## Impact on Personal Development and Identity

The constant pursuit of money, often at the expense of other life areas, is criticized. True wealth encompasses abundance in finance, health, mindset, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Neglecting health or relationships for business ultimately hinders overall well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

[[the_impact_of_money_on_personal_growth | Money is seen as a lagging indicator of success]]; efforts today yield results in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. True happiness comes from giving one's best and striving for continuous [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | development]], not from achieving specific financial milestones, which can lead to complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

## Modern Challenges and Control Mechanisms

The rise of [[impact_of_ai_on_human_society | AI]] and social media has exacerbated control over information and narratives. There are concerns that AI-generated content and troll farms can manipulate public opinion, especially during events like elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. This is part of a broader agenda to impair critical thinking through various means:

*   **Pornography**: Scars memory and fries the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.
*   **"Devil Music"**: Propagates messages that condition individuals to engage in self-destructive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.
*   **Tap Water**: Fluoridation and other chemicals, including recycled hormones from birth control, contribute to a "chemical warfare" that calcifies the pineal gland and impairs cognitive thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>. This deliberate "dumbing down" keeps people as "NPCs" (non-player characters) who operate by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>.

## Overcoming Limitations for Success

### Developing Freedom of Thought
To break free, one must cultivate "freedom of thought" by questioning everything, even if uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. This means evaluating personal actions, choices, and the influences one allows into their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.

### Impatience for Good, Patience for Results
While modern society fosters impatience, especially among younger generations due to instant gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>, true success requires being "impatient towards the good things" (e.g., daily discipline, sales calls, reading) and patient with the outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. One can control their input (actions) but not necessarily the immediate output (results) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.

### Embracing Discomfort and Responsibility
The single biggest limiting factor for most people is their tendency to blame others and fear the consequences of taking responsibility for their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. Everyone is self-made, but only the successful admit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. Overcoming this requires being comfortable with failure and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

When faced with extreme hardship, such as financial struggle, turning that "pain into fire in the belly" can be a powerful motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:09">[01:32:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:28">[01:32:28]</a>. Having nothing to lose creates a unique drive for [[challenges_facing_young_men_in_society | individual success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:24">[01:33:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:26">[01:33:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>.

Ultimately, achieving [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | greatness]] involves a disciplined process, sacrifice, and the continuous development of positive philosophies, ideas, habits, and work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:08">[02:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:10">[02:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:12">[02:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:14">[02:04:14]</a>.

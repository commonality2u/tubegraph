Cultural upbringing and family dynamics significantly shape an individual's perception of the world, relationships, and even their career choices. The interplay between traditional values and modern environments can lead to unique challenges and insights into human connection.

## Childhood Influences and Upbringing

Simone's childhood in Australia, following a move from Singapore at three years old, was characterized by a diverse immigrant community [00:06:22]. This environment, where most classmates were immigrant kids, fostered an early exposure to [[the_role_of_cultural_fit_in_business | cognitive diversity]] [00:07:05].

Despite this diversity, growing up during a period of anti-immigration sentiment, particularly from a far-right politician, led to uncomfortable experiences [00:07:21]. Simone recalls conversations in art class questioning whether Asians should "go home" [00:07:42]. She experienced a "conflicting perverse Pride" when told she was "one of us" by non-Asian peers, highlighting an innate human desire for safety and belonging, even when it meant aligning with groups that disliked her ethnic background [00:08:42].

### Parental Influence and Communication Styles

Simone's father, a humble Chinese Singaporean shopkeeper, possessed profound wisdom, which Simone describes as an "Eastern zenness" [00:09:35]. He taught her that "it's nice to be important but it's far more important to be nice" [00:10:51]. He demonstrated kindness even to insects, reflecting a Taoist sensibility [00:11:00]. He recognized Simone's highly sensitive and empathetic nature, attempting to temper a perceived "wildness" [00:11:25].

In contrast, Simone's mother was very dominant, emphasizing obedience, which is common in Singaporean families [00:15:10]. This contrasted sharply with the Western environment Simone was growing up in, leading her to feel "suffocated" [00:15:20]. Her mother's parenting was largely driven by fear, with cautionary tales designed to enforce strict boundaries and definitions of success, such as marrying well, having children by a certain age (though her mother had children late), and not bringing shame to the family [00:15:53]. This strict upbringing, however, may have inadvertently fostered a sense of independence and ambition [00:15:30].

A significant aspect of Asian upbringing, as experienced by Simone and noted by many who message her, is the imbalance between criticism and affirmation [00:32:53]. Praise is often not Asian parents' primary way of showing love; instead, they express it through food and acts of service [00:33:23]. This approach, while fostering self-aptitude and competence independent of external validation, can lead to a lack of confidence in one's abilities without tangible metrics (e.g., test scores) [00:34:02].

### The Impact of [[impact_of_childhood_experiences_on_adult_relationships | Childhood Experiences on Adult Relationships]]

The relationship a child has with their primary caregiver fundamentally shapes their perception of interactions with other humans [01:18:42]. If a child's needs are not met, they may develop a narrative that others are not wholly trustworthy or reliable [01:18:50]. This wiring, which begins as early as infancy, can affect adult relationships [01:19:13].

Simone observed that individuals raised in environments with unpredictable caregivers, akin to a "roller coaster," often seek similar dynamics in adult relationships, finding stability "boring" [02:22:41]. This can lead to self-sabotaging behaviors, such as leaving secure relationships due to a subconscious craving for the familiar "roller coaster" of excitement and dopamine [02:29:58]. Healing from this requires significant self-work to move towards a more secure attachment style [02:30:53].

### Generational Shifts in Parenting

While traditional Asian parenting involved concepts like "shaming" for discipline in professional and personal contexts to uphold reputation and "face" [00:31:24], there's a recognized shift in modern parenting. Today's Singaporean parents, influenced by the internet and diverse models of parenting, are vastly different from previous generations [00:35:32]. Those interested in self-improvement are actively working to heal generational trauma and avoid transmitting negative behaviors to their children [00:36:02].

## Cultural Mobility and Global Perspectives

Simone's move to Switzerland at 18 significantly changed her perception of life, opening her mind to different ways of living [00:43:03]. The calm, predictable, and organized nature of Swiss households contrasted sharply with the "low-level fight or flight" she experienced in her childhood home [00:46:47]. This exposure to different cultural norms, like the Swiss meticulousness with groceries versus the Asian tradition of overflowing food for visitors, highlighted the diversity of human experience [00:44:05].

This [[the_role_of_cultural_fit_in_business | cultural mobility]] became a "biggest gift and also the biggest curse," making it difficult to live in monocultures later in life due to a broadened perspective and a desire for cognitive diversity [00:45:28].

### Dubai vs. Singapore: Cultural Nuances

Having lived in both Dubai and Singapore, Simone notes distinct cultural differences, despite both cities being modeled, indirectly, after Switzerland [01:30:13].

*   **Diversity:** Dubai is significantly more diverse than Singapore, with foreign residents making up the majority of the population [01:30:31]. This offers immense opportunities for learning from diverse viewpoints if one is open-minded [01:31:15].
*   **Wealth Display:** Wealth is more overtly demonstrated in Dubai, contrasting with Singapore's more discreet culture [01:24:45]. This can lead to a more "shallow" perception, particularly for those focused on human connection [01:25:05].
*   **Transience and Relationships:** Dubai is an extremely transient city, leading to a high degree of "flakiness" in friendships and dating [01:26:54]. This environment can inadvertently attract individuals with [[impact_of_childhood_experiences_on_adult_relationships | abandonment]] issues, perpetuating cycles of being "left over and over again" [01:26:31].
*   **Building Connections:** In Singapore, like Switzerland, building deep local friendships requires significant effort and time to gain trust, especially to be invited into a home [01:32:43]. However, once formed, these friendships are often characterized by strong loyalty [01:33:36].

These experiences highlight that while some cities may appear disconnected or superficial, it is still possible to create meaningful connections by filtering for shared values [01:31:52].

## Societal Norms and Personal Growth

The pressures of societal norms, particularly in the professional world, can lead to personal struggles. Simone's experience in a media outlet in Singapore, where "shame was used to discipline people" through public criticism, exemplifies a challenging cultural work environment [00:31:27]. This reflects the [[importance_of_culture_and_leadership_in_organizations | impact of culture and leadership in organizations]] on individual well-being.

The realization that happiness is a choice, irrespective of external circumstances, often comes from navigating life's highs and lows [01:07:01]. This contrasts with the pursuit of materialistic goals that can lead to feeling unfulfilled upon achievement [01:10:40]. Simone emphasizes that true personal growth and self-worth are not dependent on external validation or material possessions [01:37:38]. This perspective is crucial for personal development, especially for those prioritizing paying rent over self-actualization [01:37:52].

The journey of healing and self-awareness, though challenging and often involving "outbreaks" akin to a skin reaction, is essential for long-term well-being and prevents the manifestation of untreated emotions into physical illness [01:01:27]. It is a continuous process that allows individuals to break free from cycles of self-sabotage and societal pressures, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and authentic life.

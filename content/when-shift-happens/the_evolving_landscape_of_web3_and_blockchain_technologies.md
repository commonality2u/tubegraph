The [[vision_and_innovation_in_blockchain_technology | web3]] space is considered fascinating and represents a significant shift in technology, disrupting conventional norms and commercial models [00:48:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">00:48:00</a>). This ongoing transformation is viewed as equally disruptive as the internet and mobile revolutions [02:49:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">02:49:00</a>).

## Core Components of Web3

For Olly Yonshev, co-founder and CEO of Flight Story, [[vision_and_innovation_in_blockchain_technology | web3]] is distilled into three primary areas:
*   **Blockchain Technologies** This includes the new possibilities created by blockchain, such as [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_ecosystem_challenges | cryptocurrencies]], NFTs, and decentralization [02:50:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">02:50:50</a>).
*   **Immersive Digital Experiences** This encompasses augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the concept of the metaverse [02:51:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">02:51:50</a>).
*   **Real-world Application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence** [[the_evolution_and_future_of_crypto_and_ai_integration | AI]] and machine learning are increasingly prevalent and will play a significant role in the future [02:51:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">02:51:50</a>).

These three components are expected to play a significant role in our future, making it crucial for businesses to understand and proficiently navigate them [02:54:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">02:54:00</a>).

## Personal Perspective on Crypto and Investment

Olly Yonshev personally holds [[cryptocurrency_and_blockchain_ecosystem_challenges | crypto]] in his portfolio, although it constitutes less than 10% of his investments, reflecting a balanced and relatively stable investment approach [02:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">02:47:00</a>).

Initially, he was a cynic of [[the_evolution_of_digital_wallets_and_blockchain | crypto]], struggling to imagine a world where governments would relinquish control and allow borderless movements [02:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">02:47:00</a>). However, his view evolved as regulations began to form and the foundations of a "new world order" started to emerge [02:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">02:47:00</a>). He acknowledges that while there are still "many unknown unknowns," the changing regulatory landscape played a role in shifting his perspective [02:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">02:47:00</a>).

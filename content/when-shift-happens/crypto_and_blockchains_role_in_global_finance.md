David Shin, a leader at Immutable X, is actively shaping digital asset policies and advising central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His journey into the world of crypto began in February 2012, when a friend from another bank introduced him to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Upon reading the Bitcoin white paper, Shin couldn't sleep that night, indicating a profound shift in his understanding of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Having spent over 20 years in Asia, primarily in investment banking for 17-18 years, Shin discovered Bitcoin in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Early Discoveries and Challenges
Shin was one of the first ASIC miners, though he faced challenges with pre-funded chips not being delivered, with payment taken upfront in Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. By 2013, he became involved with Ripple, openly discussing Bitcoin and [[the_role_blockchain_in_future_wealth_creation | blockchain]]'s potential to affect Swift and cross-border payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Disrupting Traditional Finance
Shin approached Ripple to pivot their strategy towards disrupting Swift using Ripple's infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### The Swift Network's Centralization
The Swift network, a consortium of banks, is very centralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It prioritizes certain banks, like JP Morgan and City Bank, over regional banks in Asia for cross-border transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This prioritization and the intermediaries involved lead to higher costs and significant latency (3-5 business days) for international transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

> [!info] The true cost of Swift
> While Swift itself isn't a highly profitable business due to infrastructure maintenance costs, the larger banks within the consortium generate significant revenue by intentionally creating latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This latency allows them to create short-term pools of funds that they lend to each other in the interbank lending market, influencing rates like Libor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Critique of Traditional Banking
Shin questions whether banks should be commercial institutions or utility companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. He argues that banks primarily make money by using customer deposits for lending and creating credit markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This model, which involves taking significant risks, leads to economic bubbles and crises, as seen in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. He believes deposit money should be held in custody rather than used for speculative secondary markets driven by greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## A Vision for a New Economic Incentive Model
Shin proposes an economic incentive model based on social credit, where people are incentivized to "do good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This system, using blockchain tokens, would involve public addresses accumulating "green tokens" for good contributions (e.g., funding, open-source building) and "red tokens" for bad behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This is presented as a decentralized approach to monitoring behavior, distinct from centralized CBDCs controlled by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. He believes this system could encourage a more principled and less toxic online environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

## Ripple's Current Trajectory
Despite the perception among some [[crypto_adoption_and_the_role_of_blockchain_in_future_investments | crypto]] natives that "nothing is happening" with Ripple, Shin asserts that Ripple is actively working with banks and regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. Banks like Standard Chartered are quietly implementing RippleNet as a payment option for cross-border settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. The quiet nature of this development is largely due to the ongoing SEC challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

> [!tip] Ripple vs. Cardano
> Shin contrasts Ripple's quiet, bank-focused development with Cardano, suggesting that newcomers often gravitate towards projects with strong personalities but lack clear identity or underlying action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

## Real World Assets (RWA) and Tokenization
With the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, institutional interest in crypto is expected to grow, leading to the tokenization of other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. Larry Fink of BlackRock has also spoken about tokenizing everything, including financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. Shin is bullish on [[crypto_adoption_and_the_role_of_blockchain_in_future_investments | RWA]], particularly the tokenization of commodities like gold, which can be more efficient than current ETF or futures trading methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. He highlights companies like Sakata, which built an RWA product on Maple Finance, focusing on tokenizing credit and financial products to bring existing yields into DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.

## Geopolitical Shifts and Blockchain's Role
Shin closely monitors macroeconomic signals and global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. He has observed a trend of countries "dedollarizing," citing examples like Iran, Russia, and the EU's direct purchase of Iranian oil outside of the US dollar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

### The Rise of BRICS
The BRICS alliance (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) initially started as a Goldman Sachs research idea about emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. It has since evolved into a formal membership, recently adding countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. BRICS aims to create an alternative trading system that bypasses Swift and the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. Shin believes this alternative will be a blockchain-based digital currency, whether CBDCs or stablecoins, running on [[ethereums_role_and_infrastructure_in_financial_markets | blockchain-based settlement rails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

> [!quote] The future of the dollar
> Shin's prediction is that the US dollar will eventually cease to be the global intermediary currency for settling trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. He argues that the US economy relies on wars to justify printing more dollars, but this system is threatened by the world moving away from the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. He anticipates this shift will accelerate if China acts on Taiwan (between now and 2027), leading to sanctions against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>. China, having conducted "dry runs" like the Shanghai COVID lockdown, is prepared to use its e-remby and direct swaps within BRICS to circumvent the US dollar and Swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.

### Africa's Pivotal Role
Africa is seen as the biggest benefactor of these geopolitical shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:28">[01:19:28]</a>. The continent is geopolitically neutral, unlike India or Singapore, which are exposed to both East and West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. The African Union's structure, similar to Europe's, allows individual countries to join alliances like BRICS without forcing the entire union to take a side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>. Furthermore, Africa possesses over 30% of the world's resources and 60% of its arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. As global challenges arise from deglobalization, particularly concerning supply chains, food, and minerals, Africa is poised to become the world's marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.

## Conclusion
Shin emphasizes that [[the_role_of_blockchain_in_future_wealth_creation | crypto]] and [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | blockchain]] are more than just technology; they are at the forefront of changing how countries trade and operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. This includes democratizing resources for continents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:43">[01:22:43]</a>. However, he also cautions that as everything moves online, it can give more power back to governments due to increased traceability, making it a double-edged sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>.

Luca Nets, CEO and owner of Pudgy Penguins, a leading Web3 IP company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11"></a>, shares his perspectives on the evolving landscape of crypto and technological advancements. Having started his first business at 18 and becoming a millionaire by 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>, Nets brings a unique entrepreneurial lens to the digital asset space.

## The Role of Marketing and Branding in Web3

Nets believes that the Web3 and NFT industry is fundamentally about marketing and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44"></a>. He highlights that while there are many great technical minds in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13"></a>, the space often lacks effective branding and consumer product packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32"></a>. He compares the current state of crypto to the early computer industry, where IBM and Microsoft had the technology, but Apple and Macintosh excelled at packaging and branding it for the consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36"></a>.

The challenge, according to Nets, is that crypto often tries to sell itself based on its front-end technology, which can be intimidating, rather than highlighting its back-end power that fuels the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:11:05"></a>. He aims to bridge this gap, doing for crypto what Apple did for computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51"></a>.

## Defining a True Web3 Business

Nets distinguishes between a Web2 business and a Web3 business. A Web2 business is built in a silo by a core team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54"></a>. In contrast, a Web3 business is built with the "hive mind" of its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47"></a>. He views the community as the "superpower" of a Web3 business, where the entrepreneur's role is to take community feedback, extract it, and build the best product based on collective wants and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04"></a>. He asserts that merely selling digital products on the blockchain does not make a company Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31"></a>.

## Personal Journey and Market Observations

Nets' "aha moment" with crypto came from the realization that the ability to transact freely without a middleman is a basic human right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22"></a>. This aligns with his long-standing approach of identifying businesses that lean into basic human rights, such as communication (cell phones) and socialization (social media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58"></a>.

He began investing in crypto around 2016-2017, initially through mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21"></a>. Despite "bag-holding" through the 2017 peak and subsequent downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26"></a>, he continued to believe in the long-term potential of crypto. He now applies a "high conviction" [[investing_in_crypto_and_identifying_market_opportunities | investment strategy]], putting "all the chips at the table" when the market is down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47"></a>. He emphasizes that money is made by buying when prices are low, not high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10"></a>.

## NFTs and the Future

His entry into NFTs was driven by a passion for collecting, finding digital collectibles a convenient alternative to physical ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40"></a>. His first significant NFT purchase was a Pudgy Penguin, which eventually led him to acquire the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17"></a>.

Nets believes crypto is "coming back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53"></a>, indicating a positive outlook on [[future_prospects_and_trends_in_the_crypto_market | future prospects and trends in the crypto market]]. His vision for Pudgy Penguins is to be the number one NFT project globally, the "face of crypto and blockchain and NFTs and Web3," and one of the world's most beloved new IP brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21"></a>. This ambition underscores the potential for technological advancements to create new forms of intellectual property and consumer products.

## Global Perspective on Technological Advancement

Nets observed during his travels in Asia (Japan, South Korea, Singapore) that these regions are "eons ahead" of America and Europe in terms of technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02"></a>. He noted the efficient systems, processes, and culture of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44"></a>. This exposure to different technological landscapes influences his understanding of the global [[impact_of_technological_advancements_and_market_patterns_on_crypto_investments | impact of technological advancements and market patterns on crypto investments]].

The crypto space is viewed by many participants as an industry positioned for significant growth over the next decade. There's a fundamental belief that [[the_future_of_the_crypto_market | crypto will be bigger]] than it is currently, regardless of the specific applications that will be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Investment Psychology

A key aspect of [[cryptocurrency_market_trends_and_predictions | cryptocurrency market trends and predictions]] is understanding investor behavior. People often become "religiously attached" to an asset, viewing it like a football team or their culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:26">[02:27:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:26">[02:29:26]</a>. This emotional connection can condition people to believe a certain action, like buying the dip, will always make money, until it eventually doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:50">[03:09:50]</a>.

The "too big to fail" mentality, as seen with Luna (a top 4-5 crypto that went to zero), can lead investors to find excuses not to sell, even when an asset is fundamentally unsound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:50">[03:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:31">[03:25:31]</a>. It's crucial to adopt a mindset that all assets "can go to zero" and to have stop losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:10">[03:09:10]</a>.

Another common psychological pitfall is the "I missed it" feeling when an asset has already pumped, which often prevents people from buying when they should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:58">[03:45:58]</a>. To overcome this, it's suggested to "ape" a small amount of an asset initially to gain conviction and attention, as having "skin in the game" is essential for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:48">[03:57:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:57">[03:59:57]</a>.

The "educational cycle" in crypto investing often involves experiencing significant losses or "blowing up" at least once, which forces investors to test their limits and learn from failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:52">[03:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:22">[04:04:22]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges

Post-FTX, there's a question of whether "bad people" were truly washed out of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>. A concern is that the projects flourishing since the bear market bottom are often "nihilistic gambling apps" or "money games," rather than truly innovative applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:01">[03:04:01]</a>. This presents a [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_crypto | challenge for builders]] who are trying to create real value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>.

The sentiment that "every coin is a meme coin" is a worrying trend, as it suggests a lack of intrinsic value in tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:08">[06:06:08]</a>. While meme coins can be "super fun" and have a place for speculation, they should not be the primary focus or "capture" the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:05">[06:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:26">[06:27:26]</a>. There's a desire for tokens to behave more like securities, representing equity in the company's future, not just a fee switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

A significant [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | challenge]] in crypto is the difficulty of scaling user adoption beyond crypto natives. Founders like Vitalik Buterin express a desire to see applications that can be used by "grandmas" and "normies," where the crypto mechanics happen seamlessly in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:33">[08:47:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:52">[08:50:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:07">[09:26:07]</a>.

## Future Trends and Predictions

### DeFi and Altcoins
There is a strong prediction for the "return of DeFi" and for "defi coins" like Aave (AAVE) and Uniswap (UNI) to reach all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:05">[11:52:05]</a>. This suggests a belief that the pendulum has swung too far towards "financial nihilism" and people will eventually want to believe in more fundamental investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:08">[11:38:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:07">[11:42:07]</a>.

### Ethereum vs. Solana
Regarding the competition between major chains, it's observed that while many at conferences are excited about Solana, more users are actively engaged with Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions. Most innovation and applications continue to be built on Ethereum, suggesting that one should be "longer Ethereum than Solana" over the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:07">[11:50:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:07">[11:50:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:07">[12:02:07]</a>. This is based on the idea of not always following market consensus or the "herd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:25">[12:29:25]</a>.

### Political and Macroeconomic Outlook
The potential for a Kamala Harris presidency could lead to "Operation Choke Point 3.0," which might hinder progress in how applications are built and how value is delivered to tokens in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:07">[12:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:07">[12:13:07]</a>.

From a broader [[the_significance_of_macroeconomic_trends_in_the_crypto_space | macroeconomic trends]] perspective, the continuous nature of "money printing" and the political desire for liquidity suggest that one should not be "long the dollar." Instead, it's advisable to be "long sound money" or even "speculative stuff" because liquidity will continue to flow into these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:53">[12:20:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:07">[12:21:07]</a>.

### Tokenomics and Value
A critical future trend is the differentiation between meme coins and non-meme coins, as the space collectively tries to understand how to determine "real value" in its diverse assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:07">[11:50:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Current tokenomics models are considered "complete trash" and "barbaric," designed without deep expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:07">[11:43:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:07">[11:50:07]</a>. However, there's optimism that "better models" for tokenomics will emerge in the next 12 months, potentially making crypto an "investable asset class" for average people seeking sustainable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:07">[12:45:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:07">[12:47:07]</a>.

## Unpredictability of the Future
Ultimately, no one can predict the future of the crypto market with certainty, even the most "prolific minds" in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:41">[11:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:07">[11:46:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:07">[11:46:07]</a>. It's important to maintain humility and focus on what one can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:07">[11:51:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:07">[11:53:07]</a>.

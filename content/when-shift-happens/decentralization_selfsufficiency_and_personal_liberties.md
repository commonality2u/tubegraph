Tushar Jain, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, advocates for a future centered on individual liberty, self-sufficiency, and [[decentralization_and_its_challenges | decentralized decision-making]], highlighting their importance in various aspects of life, from finance to personal autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Core Principles

### Voluntarism and Liberty
Jain's guiding principle is that liberty and freedom lead to the best outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. He identifies with the philosophy of voluntarism, which posits that individuals should never be forced to do anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. This perspective is rooted in a strong opposition to [[decentralization_vs_centralization_in_crypto_platforms | centralized decision-making]] and people dictating others' actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### The Problem with Centralized Control
Jain argues that excessive dependence on the state or any single entity leads to a dangerous concentration of power, which inevitably corrupts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. He cites a personal experience with his grandfather's end-stage kidney disease, where doctors fought against his grandfather's wish to stop treatment, viewing it as manipulative and abusive behavior by a system optimized around profit rather than individual choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. This experience reinforced his stance against external parties telling individuals what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

In the context of healthcare, Jain asserts that the US system is a "sick care system" with no priority on prevention or educating people about healthy behaviors, instead optimizing for sick individuals because that's where the money is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. He believes the outcome of such complex, chaotic systems reflects their true purpose, which in this case, is keeping people sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

## Self-Sufficiency and Personal Resilience

Jain believes that embracing [[selfsovereignty_and_personal_resilience | self-sufficiency]] is crucial. He aims to spread the psychology of not relying on others to do things for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### Financial Self-Custody
Professionally, his mission is to increase access to the financial system, specifically through self-custody of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He views [[selfsovereignty_and_personal_resilience | self-custody]] in crypto as a "Trojan Horse" to a mindset where individuals realize the property rights it grants, changing their psychology and reducing dependence on the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Personal Defense and Tail Risks
Jain's belief in [[selfsovereignty_and_personal_resilience | self-sufficiency]] extends to personal defense. He finds shooting guns exhilarating and likes knowing he can defend his family in case of societal collapse or civil unrest, like the LA riots in the 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. He considers this a "tail event of life" one needs to be prepared for, emphasizing that being prepared is a cheap option against such low-probability, high-impact events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. He asserts that the right to defend oneself is the fundamental right upon which all other rights are built, as without it, other rights are merely privileges dependent on the goodwill of those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

### Independent Thinking and "High Agency"
Jain stresses the critical importance of thinking independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. He believes few people genuinely think for themselves, with most thoughts being a product of their environment and media consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. He looks for "high agency" in founders and individuals, defining it as the ability to find a way to accomplish a goal, even if it means not "coloring in the lines" or always following the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. As an example of a high-agency move, he points to college dropouts who prioritize their goals over social credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

## [[Decentralization and the Future of the Internet | Decentralization]] in Technology and Finance

Jain sees [[decentralization_and_the_future_of_the_internet | blockchain technology]] as a new coordination mechanism that will lead to enormous wealth creation, similar to past historical shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. He believes the next trillion-dollar businesses will be built using blockchain rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### From Bitcoin to Ethereum
His fascination began with Bitcoin in 2013, viewing it as tuition to learn about a "weird" new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. However, he became "all in" professionally when he saw Ethereum in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. He likens the Internet's impact on communication to the printing press, predicting Ethereum will be the new coordination layer for distrusting people to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

### Impact on Business and Markets
Jain believes that crypto, along with AI, will significantly collapse margins across industries because everything is open-source and permissionless, making it difficult to extract rents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. He views this as positive for consumers, aligning with his belief that the economy's organizing principle should prioritize consumer benefit over producer profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Solana's Role
Multicoin Capital has made a significant bet on Solana, which Jain sees as delivering what users truly care about in a blockchain: cheap, fast, and easy transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. He notes Solana's inexpensive transaction costs, fast block times, and simple single-wallet, single-chain user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. While new chains may offer similar benefits, Solana's inertia makes it difficult to unseat without a "significantly better" alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

### Ugly Truths in Crypto Investing
Jain shares "ugly truths" about crypto investing, including the limited number of actual use cases (mostly payments, trading, and capital formation) and the prevalence of investing based on "vibes" rather than rigorous analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. He advises focusing on clear product-market fit and avoiding "pie in the sky" ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## Conclusion
Tushar Jain's philosophy is deeply rooted in personal liberty and [[selfsovereignty_and_personal_resilience | self-sufficiency]], extending from individual health and safety to the structure of financial systems and the future of technology. He believes in embracing [[decentralization_and_its_challenges | decentralization]] and independent thought to navigate a complex world and empower individuals against centralized control.

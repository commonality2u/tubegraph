PayPal has launched a new service enabling eligible customers in the UK to [[paypal_cryptocurrency_services_in_the_uk | buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency]] directly from their PayPal accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This expansion into digital assets is significant, given PayPal's substantial user base of 377 million users as of late 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and a Q2 revenue of $6.24 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Available Cryptocurrencies
The service supports the purchase and sale of four major cryptocurrencies:
*   Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Bitcoin Cash (a fork of the original Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Litecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

## Service Access and Process
The service was officially announced around August 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Eligible UK customers can access it via the PayPal app, where a dedicated "crypto section" allows them to [[process_of_buying_cryptocurrency_with_paypal | buy and sell crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The [[process_of_buying_cryptocurrency_with_paypal | process of buying cryptocurrency]] is straightforward, requiring users to confirm their tax residency status and acknowledge risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. PayPal leverages existing Know Your Customer (KYC) details from established accounts, simplifying the setup for current users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Purchase Minimums and Fees
Users can buy as little as one pound's worth of cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. [[Comparison of fees for cryptocurrency purchases on PayPal | Fees]] are applied to transactions; for example, a £1 purchase of Ethereum incurs a 50p fee, while a £10 purchase also incurs a 50p fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Limitations and User Experience
While PayPal offers a convenient entry point for cryptocurrency exposure, there are [[limitations_of_using_paypal_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | limitations]]:
*   **No Peer-to-Peer Transfers**: Users currently cannot send cryptocurrency to others or use it for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **No Private Keys**: Users do not receive a private key for their crypto holdings, meaning PayPal retains control over the assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Centralized Platform**: The service is centralized, meaning users must trust PayPal with their funds and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

The interface is described as very basic and simple, making it well-suited for new users or those seeking minimal exposure to the crypto ecosystem through "dollar cost averaging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. It is not designed for advanced users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This approach is compared to how Revolut previously introduced crypto to its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. PayPal also provides brief educational summaries about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash within its platform to help users familiarize themselves with these digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Swissborg is a crypto wealth management company based in Switzerland, co-founded by French entrepreneur Anthony, which has garnered over 1 million smart users actively investing in crypto assets [00:00:16]. The company was started six years ago [00:16:24] with a vision for transparent and community-focused finance.

## The Smart Yield Program
Swissborg developed a program called the "Smart Yield" in two months [00:00:00], which revolutionized transparency in the crypto space [00:00:05]. Unlike other platforms, Swissborg was the first to offer full transparency, allowing users to know exactly where their money was invested [01:14:11]. This initiative propelled them from zero assets under management (AUM) to 1.5 billion in just three months after launching the product [00:00:09], [01:14:23].

The Smart Yield program was designed to capitalize on the emerging [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] market, which began blossoming in the summer of 2020 [01:12:16], [01:12:33]. Swissborg recognized the desire for passive income and built a product that was genuinely derived from [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]], offering predictable returns [01:13:04], [01:14:03]. Initially, the yields were "amazing," reaching as high as 40% on USDC [01:14:51]. This high yield, combined with transparency, created significant buzz [01:15:00]. Users could verify investments themselves, even though Swissborg managed the complex tasks of analyzing smart contracts, managing funds, and paying gas fees [01:15:11].

## Swissborg's Approach Versus Competitors
Unlike many competitors such as Celsius, Voyager, and BlockFi, who used crypto as a payment or asset to invest in traditional finance leverage [01:13:21], [01:13:38], Swissborg chose not to participate in this game [01:13:40]. Their commitment to transparency and [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]]-native strategies meant that when [[highyield_stablecoin_interest | DeFi]] yields normalized to 6-8%, competitors were still offering 15% or more by taking on excessive risk [01:15:27], [01:15:33].

This principled stance led to a significant drop in AUM, from 1.5 billion down to 300 million, as users chased higher yields offered by other platforms [01:16:13]. Despite internal and external pressure, Swissborg's leadership remained firm, understanding that the higher yields from competitors came from "asymmetrical" risks that would not end well [01:16:55], [01:17:05]. The decision not to leverage traditional finance and to remain transparent about [[yield_optimization_in_crypto_space | yield optimization in the crypto space]] ultimately protected Swissborg from the collapses that afflicted many of its peers [01:17:17], [01:10:01].

## No VC Money and Core Values
A significant factor in Swissborg's resilience and commitment to its values is its unique funding model: it never raised money from venture capitalists (VCs) [00:55:25], [00:55:28]. Instead, Swissborg raised 50 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in early 2018 [00:55:02] and later secured 24 million from 17,000 individuals globally during the bear market [01:08:32].

The co-founder believes the traditional VC model is "failing 100%" because VCs often prioritize short-term returns and turnover rather than fostering long-term, sustainable businesses or truly innovative ideas [00:58:25], [01:00:35], [01:03:01]. This contrasts sharply with Swissborg's core values, which are deeply rooted in loyalty, brand, and community [00:56:34], [00:57:25]. In the crypto space, where assets like [[bitcoin_yield_earning_strategies | Bitcoin]] and [[ethereum_and_smart_contracts | Ethereum]] can be transferred instantly [00:58:02], building emotional connection and loyalty with the community becomes paramount, as opposed to the "painful" process of transferring traditional stocks [00:57:53].

Swissborg aims to reinvent how value is measured beyond mere monetary metrics, noting that society has failed to create models that truly capture intangible value like shared knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia vs. encyclopedias) [00:59:20], [00:59:24]. They believe that money should be a consequence of pursuing a higher purpose, not the primary goal [00:59:52], [01:09:50], [01:36:57].

## Long-Term Thinking and Reinventing Investment
Swissborg advocates for a shift from a "zero-sum game" mentality, where one person's gain is another's loss, to a "positive-sum game" where collaboration creates value [01:25:29]. They recognize that while trading is a zero-sum game [00:52:52], investing can be a positive-sum game if focused on long-term value creation [01:23:45].

The company believes in reinventing the investment discovery process, moving beyond simple price charts to focus on the underlying story and purpose of a project [01:26:40], [01:30:04]. Crypto can accelerate this process by incentivizing early adopters, even if their initial motivation is greed, allowing them to discover the true value and philosophy of a project over time [01:41:21], [01:43:51]. This "hack" on the system reduces the time needed for people to accept new ideas, fostering movements and changing perceptions [01:43:57], [01:48:48].

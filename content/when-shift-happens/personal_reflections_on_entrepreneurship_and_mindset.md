The interviewee shares deep [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | personal reflections]] on his [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]], highlighting the evolution of his [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | mindset]] and the critical lessons learned through various ventures, both successful and unsuccessful.

## Early Exposure to Crypto and Entrepreneurial Ventures

The speaker's [[the_influence_of_early_life_experiences_on_entrepreneurial_success | initial interaction with crypto]] began as a hobbyist while he was a student and research assistant in Singapore, tasked with exploring FinTech business models [01:11:43]. He discovered a product that utilized Bitcoin for remittances between Singapore and the Philippines, offering significantly lower prices than existing services like Wise [01:12:05]. This "completely radical idea" fascinated him and deepened his involvement in crypto [01:13:19].

Despite not having a technical background (he was a business major), he ventured into Ethereum mining with a co-founder he had known for 20 years [01:13:42]. During the ICO period in 2016-2017, they mined assets and then started "flipping ICOs" [01:15:20]. He later realized this was a bad decision, as they were "terrible with exits," often becoming "exit liquidity" [01:15:31]. This experience taught him to "just stick with Bitcoin and Eth, maybe Solana as well, and you don't have to do too many things" [01:15:59].

His first professional role in crypto was joining Kyber as one of its founding team members [01:21:09]. This opportunity was formative, teaching him everything he knows about finance and providing exposure to many interesting and capable people [01:16:30].

### Departure from Kyber and Early Failures

He left Kyber at the end of 2018, during a bear market [01:17:42]. At the time, Kyber's daily trading volume was around $50,000-$100,000, while centralized exchanges like Binance were doing hundreds of millions or even billions [01:18:55]. He describes himself as "unimaginative" for looking at the present rather than seeing what decentralized exchanges could become [01:19:25]. This marked an "important lesson" for him [01:19:37].

After leaving Kyber, he and his co-founders explored many different product ideas, both crypto and non-crypto related, but "all of them didn't work out" [01:20:32]. These [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | ventures]] included:
*   **Cold brew coffee business**: Traveling to Laos to explore coffee bean origins and considering supplying coffee shops and retail [01:20:58].
*   **Cheesecake kits**: An interest in baking led to exploring this idea [01:22:13].

These attempts, while unsuccessful, were aimed at generating income streams to sustain their dream of building something [01:22:56]. He also took on odd jobs like teaching swimming and being a lifeguard to make ends meet [01:23:22].

## Major Realizations and Shifting Mindset

The "DeFi Summer" of 2020 was a turning point, as products like Uniswap, Aave (then ETHLend), and Compound, which started in 2017-2018, finally found product-market fit after two to three years [01:25:04]. This led to a significant [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | realization]]:
> "I was the one that was not thinking big. So I was actually quite adamant not to repeat that again because that has costed me quite substantial, uh, not so much in, I mean, not just monetarily, right, but time for me to work on something meaningful." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>

This experience instilled a belief that one might be "working on the right thing but not know it" and giving up too early could mean missing a massive opportunity [02:26:46].

### The Question of Perseverance
When asked "when do you throw the towel?" on a project, he admits it's a difficult question without a clear answer [02:27:05]. His [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | experience with Pendle]], which started in 2020 and took two years of low adoption, was sustained by a strong conviction that "in any financial sector, people who are managing money want value certainty" [02:27:20]. Pendle aimed to create an instrument that offers this certainty, a need that was "largely absent in crypto" [02:27:54].

### Not Everyone Should Be an Entrepreneur
A key [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | realization]] was moving past the initial belief that "everyone should start a business" [03:00:51]. He now believes that:
> "it actually takes a lot of grit, and it takes a certain kind of personality to get things done... you need to have, I mean, first of all, self-belief, very strong self-belief, and then you need to also convey that to other people so that they can join you in that particular mission... and along the way, we're going to encounter a lot of challenges and obstacles... it really does take a certain kind of character to be able to execute with so many known and unknown challenges." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:50">[03:06:50]</a>

### Inspiration from Joseph Schooling
A powerful [[the_influence_of_early_life_experiences_on_entrepreneurial_success | personal story]] illustrating the importance of belief comes from his background as a competitive swimmer in Malaysia [03:31:10]. He had Olympic dreams but eventually abandoned them because "there was no precedence" from Southeast Asia of swimmers reaching the Olympic finals [03:48:48].

His [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | perspective changed]] in 2016 when Joseph Schooling from Singapore won a gold medal at the Olympics, beating Michael Phelps [03:29:00]. This event proved him "wrong in the biggest way possible but also in the best way possible" [03:23:23].
> "the difference between Joseph and me aside from flair, I think he must have been a much better swimmer than I was, but more importantly, I think it's just having that belief that he could one day become a gold medalist at the Olympics. I didn't have that. I looked, I was basing basing it on historical data and didn't find any pattern so I kind of dismiss it. He he was he was he he went the other way right? No one else before him did it but he went went ahead with it anyways and he achieved it. So in all honesty, I think he's one of my biggest Heroes because he showed me that indirectly he showed me that if you think big enough and with enough convictions sometimes things can happen." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>

He concludes that while resources are a "baseline" and "foundation," after a certain stage, "it's really just about mindset. You got to believe that you can do it, and you will figure out ways to get it done" [03:38:05].

### The Power of Environment and Networking
[[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | Mindset]] also helps connect with like-minded individuals [03:08:05]. A "formative experience" was attending the Cumberland Summit in 2018 in Singapore [03:56:00]. Being in a room with highly accomplished figures like CZ, Arthur Hayes, and Joe Lubin was "incredibly inspiring" [03:59:19].
> "It's one thing right to see, oh, Mark Zuckerberg, he's in Silicon Valley, and then he's done Facebook, Meta, and he's net worth is whatever, he's got a product that has that serves like billions of users every day, that all feels feels very different, distant. When at at that point in time, I think in 2018, just sitting in the same room with say CZ, Wujian, just maybe two seats next to me, it was it was extremely enlightening because they were all they were all very successful founders, and they're all self-made too. And they're able to yeah, just assert influence in the space in a way that no one's done it before. And I I actually look up to them, and and that that gave me a lot of confidence that yeah, I could do something as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>

## Professional Philosophy and Approach

His approach to crypto investing, learned through "getting wrecked" multiple times in ICOs and Luna [05:12:00], is to "just stick with the blue chips" like Bitcoin and Ethereum and "not do stupid things" [01:15:59]. He advises against recommending crypto to friends or family due to the high risk and potential for misinterpretation of advice [05:51:53].

### Pendle's Evolution and Strategy
Pendle's journey from a complex V1 with high gas fees and little traction [00:00:00] to a successful V2 highlights the importance of:
*   **Iterative product development**: Continuously improving based on user interaction and data [06:26:26].
*   **Investment in BD and growth**: Particularly in educational materials and distribution outlets [06:43:00]. He notes the Silicon Valley saying that "first time founders they focus on the product, the second time founder they focus on the distribution" [07:31:00].
*   **Strategic market positioning**: Actively "expressing a view on the kind of trends and narratives" and slotting the protocol into "big money movements" [08:12:00]. This includes leveraging LSTs, Arbitrum, and most recently, the restaking narrative [09:14:00].

<br>
> "If I were to look at it, right, in the last one and a half years of running Pendle, the product hasn't changed. It's really how we leverage on different narratives to try to position ourselves figuring out the big money movements from one trend to the other and and really inserting ourselves to to help our users capitalize on these opportunities, we we grow as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>

He specifically praises teams like Athena and Monad for their execution and understanding of crypto culture, particularly the idea that "the actual product is the community" [01:15:02].

Player identity, particularly in the context of online gaming, is a concept focused on creating a verifiable and comprehensive record of a player's history and achievements across various games and platforms. This digital footprint serves as an "online CV" for gamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## xborg: A Player Identity Protocol

Xborg is described as the world's largest player identity protocol in the gaming world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Its core function is to build an online CV for players, known as the "xbo ID" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, by combining data such as the number of games played and kills made in specific games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The ultimate goal for xborg is to empower a million players initially, and then scale to become the most prominent identity system for gamers in both Web2 and Web3 worlds, aiming to disrupt the entire gaming market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

## Value of Online Player Identity

Having an online identity like the xbo ID is valuable for several reasons:

*   **Proof of Identity/Personhood** Player identity serves as a proof of identity and personhood online, similar to projects like World ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.
*   **Combating Cheating and Bots** For game developers, a significant challenge is fighting bots and cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. When a player's identity is tied to their profile, developers can verify legitimacy because the player has connected accounts, played many games, and is vouched for by various communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. This helps in ensuring players are not abusing the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   **Reputation Layer** An identity system also acts as a reputation layer within the gaming ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.
*   **Customized Player Experiences** The next generation of web experiences is expected to be highly customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Player identity provides tools and infrastructure for developers to treat players as unique customers rather than just one of many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
    *   For example, if a game developer building an FPS game knows a new player is one of the biggest FPS players in games like Counter-Strike or Call of Duty, they can offer highly valuable, tailored experiences, email sequences, or giveaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
*   **Targeted Opportunities** An integrated player ID allows players to be whitelisted for specific opportunities, including investment opportunities, NFT mints, or giveaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.
*   **Benefits for Esports and Brands** Esports teams and brands are interested in integrating with player identity protocols to communicate with players in more effective ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>.

## Gaming as a Catalyst for Adoption

The founder of xborg believes gaming will be the primary catalyst for the mass adoption of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. While AI is a buzzword, gaming is a huge space that has the potential to change the lives of many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. The integration of USDT on Telegram's blockchain is seen as significant, but gaming is poised to make the most impact by bringing millions of people onto the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

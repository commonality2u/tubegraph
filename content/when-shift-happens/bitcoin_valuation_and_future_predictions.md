## Bitcoin Valuation

The speaker asserts that a valuation of "$100,000 per Bitcoin is just the beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This statement implies a belief in significant future appreciation for [[bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency_investment_insights | Bitcoin]].

## Future Trends and Market Role

Galaxy Digital, a publicly listed asset and blockchain leader, aims to understand the good and bad aspects of the crypto space and transmit that knowledge to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Their role involves building businesses that mirror traditional finance to integrate it with crypto, including banking, trading, and asset management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.

### Infrastructure and Real-World Use Cases
Galaxy Digital is heavily focused on infrastructure development, including staking, validators, decentralized finance (DeFi) lending, and DeFi trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. The belief is that the world will gradually move on-chain, with blockchains being used for real-world applications once they become sufficiently cheap, safe, and trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. This transition is seen as a key driver for [[future_prospects_and_trends_in_the_crypto_market | future market growth]].

### The Role of AI in Crypto
The speaker predicts that within 12 to 24 months, there will be a significant jump in AI adoption, where AI agents will start working for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

In the context of [[cryptocurrency_market_trends_and_predictions | crypto]], AI is expected to:
*   **Accelerate Development**: All coders will likely need to use AI, leading to an acceleration in development within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.
*   **Decentralization Counterbalance**: AI is viewed as a centralizing force due to its reliance on massive data centralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. Blockchains are seen as the necessary counterbalance, offering a protective measure against "Big Brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.
*   **Facilitate Transactions**: AI agents will eventually manage personal finances, such as shopping for groceries, which will operate more smoothly on crypto rails than traditional financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.

While AI's influence might exacerbate existing societal problems, like the struggles faced by young men (e.g., through AI girlfriends), its integration with blockchain technology is considered crucial for future financial operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.

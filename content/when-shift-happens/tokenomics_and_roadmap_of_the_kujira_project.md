Kujira's Initial DEX Offering (IDO) has gone live on Starterra, a platform that has been live for a while and is awaiting the "cold5 upgrade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Kujira aims to empower retail crypto users to compete with "whales and elites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Kujira's First Product: Orca

[[kujiras_suite_of_products_and_future_offerings | Orca]] is Kujira's initial product, designed as a platform for automated bids on collateral liquidated from Anchor Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. To understand [[kujiras_objective_in_the_crypto_market | Kujira]], one must first understand how Anchor works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Understanding Anchor Protocol Liquidations

Anchor Protocol lends out UST, a stablecoin pegged to the value of a dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Borrowers provide collateral in the form of non-stable assets to mitigate the risk of lending UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Anchor allows borrowers to withdraw up to 60% of the collateral's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The mechanics of liquidation are as follows:
*   **At-Risk Loans:** If the collateral's value falls to a point where the loan exceeds a certain threshold, it is deemed "at risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Liquidators' Role:** Liquidators repay the shortfall on the collateral to the lender (Anchor) on behalf of the borrower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The loan value is measured in UST, so liquidation is paid in UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Collateral Forfeiture:** Once liquidated, Anchor receives the UST it loaned, and the borrower forfeits their collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The collateral becomes the property of the liquidator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Liquidator Premium:** Liquidators are compensated with a premium, which is effectively a discount on the price of the non-stable assets used as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This discount on Orca can range from 1% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Bid Prioritization:** Market forces dictate that liquidators accepting smaller premiums (lower discounts) are the first to access at-risk capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Previously, it was a "first come, first served" basis based on execution speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Bids at lower premiums are filled first before moving up to higher premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Orca Platform Features

The Orca platform aims to make accessing the liquidation process simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Users can place bids at various premium positions, from 0% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Bidding:** Users decide how much to bid and at which premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. There are no minimum or maximum bid amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Benefit for Borrowers:** By bidding at lower percentage rates (e.g., 2-5%), users can help ensure the person getting liquidated loses less collateral than if the liquidation ran to a 30% premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Payouts:** Payouts from successful liquidations are received in the collateral itself, such as bLuna or bETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The platform displays the user's average discount received on these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Bid Management:** Bids can be canceled without a locking period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Users can also select whether they are after bETH or [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | bLuna]] collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Kujira Tokenomics

[[role_and_future_of_tokens_in_cryptocurrency_projects | Kujira]] is building a suite of products, which will include a token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

*   **Network:** Terra network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>
*   **Total Supply:** 150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>
*   **Project Valuation:** Currently 27 million UST (a "pretty low market cap") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>
*   **IDO Goal:** Aiming to raise 3 million UST from the Starterra raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
*   **Distribution:** Information on seed rounds, liquidity, marketing, and airdrops is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Kujira's Roadmap: Future Offerings

Kujira's objective is to build a [[kujiras_suite_of_products_and_future_offerings | suite of products]] that offer users access to "perhaps not seen before tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

*   **Beluga:** Another product on the roadmap is [[kujiras_suite_of_products_and_future_offerings | Beluga]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This tool will allow users to send any CW20 tokens (tokens on the Terra network) to multiple addresses simultaneously using a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **Cost Efficiency:** Testing showed that sending to 11 different addresses cost $3.20 in total gas, compared to an estimated $22 UST for 11 separate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This feature is expected to significantly reduce gas fees for users moving money around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

The speaker notes that this is an early look into the Orca platform and the IDO page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, recommending users to review the website, whitepaper, and understand Anchor's liquidation mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

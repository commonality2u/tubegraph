In the Web3 and crypto space, the prevailing sentiment is that the [[role_of_community_in_the_success_of_web3_projects | community is the business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This perspective highlights a fundamental shift from traditional business models, where the product might be the primary focus, to one where the community forms the core of the enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Community as the Business Backbone

Unlike traditional ventures, a crypto business's primary asset is its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The product often serves as marketing for the community, rather than the community being a mere target for product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, the toy business of Pudgy Penguins is seen as a marketing channel to its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, and Jupiter Exchange views its "enormous amount of time" spent on product development as marketing to build its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This approach ensures that the product truly reflects the ethos and values of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

The [[the_importance_of_community_and_longterm_thinking_in_the_crypto_industry | community is the backbone]] of a crypto business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Having the community on your side allows a project to move ten times faster; otherwise, it risks a "tragic death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Building and Sustaining the Community

While many crypto founders claim community is important, only a small percentage genuinely prioritize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This is because building and maintaining a community requires significant effort and time, often seen as additional work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

For Pudgy Penguins, the Web3 side of the business, which is heavily community-focused, is considered a "giant loss leader" in terms of royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. However, this investment is crucial because it forms the "nucleus" from which other revenue streams derive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Investors recognize this, valuing companies like Pudgy Penguins at higher multiples due to their [[insights_into_building_and_managing_a_business_in_the_crypto_industry | revenue potential that comes from taking care of the community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This strategy operates on the principle that if you take care of your holders, they will reciprocate that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Key Elements of Community Building

Three crucial elements for [[building_a_successful_crypto_community_and_marketing_strategy | building a strong community]] are:
*   **Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>
*   **Transparency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>
*   **Empathy**: Understanding the community's concerns, even if they seem trivial, is vital because people invest their money and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

Jupiter's co-founder also emphasizes:
*   **Sincerity/Genuineness**: Being honest and true to what you want to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.
*   **Tactfulness**: Delivering messages in a thoughtful way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.
*   **Empathy**: Founders must appreciate that community members are people with feelings and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.

The most important aspect is for the community to believe that the founders are "in it with them" and "not extracting" value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This commitment builds a foundation of goodwill, crucial for [[resilience_in_business_and_its_importance_in_the_crypto_market | surviving challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. Jupiter, for example, built its platform for three to four years without a token to establish trust and prove its dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

## The Role of Tokens and IP

A token is considered important for a community-driven business because it is the "only way to align community members in a way that is unparalleled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. However, launching a token can be "extremely distracting for product" development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. A project should only launch a token when it is "synergistic" with the community and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.

Intellectual Property (IP) can serve as a "Trojan horse" for crypto, bringing in people not solely focused on price speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. IP fosters digital ownership, participation, and brand loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. It provides a scalable playbook for adoption and draws users into crypto through engagement rather than just buying and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. For Pudgy Penguins, the IP-driven products like toys are seen as marketing for the community, aiming to expand their "army" of holders from 20,000 to potentially 500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

## Competition and Community

In the competitive world of tokens, every project is a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. However, strong community acts as a differentiating factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Even if a competitor creates a similar product, they struggle to gain traction if they haven't developed a strong community and brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The founder of Jupiter describes handling competition with a "schizophrenic" approach: initial paranoia to ensure all bases are covered, followed by acceptance and learning from competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This leads to co-existence or growth through learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

## [[The Role of Memecoins in the Crypto Market | Memecoins]] and Community

The host states that "every coin is a [[the_role_of_memecoins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coin]]" if you "know the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Pudgy Penguins even has a "Pangu prophecy" that claims its [[the_role_of_zero_culture_and_expectations_in_cryptocurrency_communities | Pangu meme coin]] could become larger than any other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The product (whether an NFT or a memecoin) is essentially content and a "vibe" that serves as marketing for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

## [[Entrepreneurship Lessons in the Crypto Space | Entrepreneurship]] and [[opportunities_in_crypto_and_the_role_of_timing_and_social_media_influence | Opportunities in Crypto]]

Founders must balance building a business with fostering a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. A key frustration is doing "something really big" like a Walmart announcement, only for the NFT's value to drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. This highlights the need for a "liquid token" to directly reward the community for such efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

The future of crypto and its adoption is seen through two lenses: a value-driven view and a pragmatic view focused on making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. Successful projects combine both, building the best products for trading while also fostering a community united by values like decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

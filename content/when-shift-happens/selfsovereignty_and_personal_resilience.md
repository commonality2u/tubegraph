From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 
Melum Demos, an early crypto investor and general partner at Crucible, strongly advocates for [[decentralization_selfsufficiency_and_personal_liberties | self-sovereignty]] and [[personal_resilience_and_adaptability | personal resilience]], embodying these principles in her own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:53">[01:29:53]</a>. For Demos, it is crucial to "walk the talk" rather than merely theorizing about these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>.

### Practical Self-Sovereignty

Demos is actively working to take her house off the grid, implementing various measures to ensure her [[decentralization_selfsufficiency_and_personal_liberties | self-sufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. These include:
*   Burying a 3500-gallon propane tank for energy storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>.
*   Utilizing a generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:15">[01:29:15]</a>.
*   Running off well water and having two ponds for water storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>.
*   Maintaining a year's supply of beans and other legumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:25">[01:29:25]</a>.
*   Installing solar and battery systems that will operate on [[decentralization_selfsufficiency_and_personal_liberties | decentralized]] energy generation protocols, specifically the Glow Network and Daylight Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.
*   Investing in personal security measures, such as acquiring a Beretta 1301 tactical shotgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:46">[01:29:46]</a>.

These actions are a direct reflection of her belief that if one talks about [[decentralization_selfsufficiency_and_personal_liberties | self-sovereignty]] and invests in it, they must also actively practice it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>. Demos emphasizes that true [[decentralization_selfsufficiency_and_personal_liberties | self-sovereignty]] involves significant planning, effort, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>.

### Building Personal Resilience in Demanding Environments

Working in nascent industries like crypto presents immense psychological challenges due to extreme volatility and constant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a>. Demos highlights the importance of managing one's psychology and physical health to maintain [[building_resilience_and_managing_stress | personal resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.

Key aspects of her approach include:
*   **Prioritizing well-being:** Recognizing that investing, especially in nascent industries, is a creative endeavor, she finds ways to "refill and recharge" her battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.
*   **Structured downtime:** Despite a demanding schedule, Demos prefers an open calendar to allow for creativity and serendipity, avoiding being over-scheduled which can lead to depletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>. She notes that communication often happens outside of formal calls, via messaging apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "The Circuit":** Reflecting on 2021, when her life was consumed by crypto events and parties, she realized it led to poor decision-making and a bad state of mind due to lack of sleep and space to think rationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>. She advocates for taking a step away from constant exposure to the same echo chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.
*   **Diverse perspectives:** Demos actively seeks conversations with non-crypto people, including friends in commodities, FX trading, or clean tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. This allows her to gain fresh perspectives, test her ideas, and ensure she can explain complex crypto concepts to those outside the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. She notes the importance of engaging with people outside the crypto sphere for the phenomenon to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.
*   **Intellectual flexibility:** Demos emphasizes maintaining intellectual flexibility, as the nascent state of the industry means directions are uncertain and rigid "theses" might be too inflexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:40">[02:00:40]</a>.
*   **Learning from history:** She finds frameworks and historical patterns, like those observed in the oil industry with fracking, helpful for understanding current market dynamics and technological shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:12">[03:16:12]</a>.
*   **Embracing absurdity:** Demos believes it's important to have a healthy sense of humor in crypto, as many profoundly serious things in the space stem from "unserious" or absurd origins, making the journey more enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>. This perspective also helps in navigating the industry's unique dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

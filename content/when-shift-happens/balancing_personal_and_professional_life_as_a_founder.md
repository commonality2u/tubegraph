Magnus Greenland, founder and CEO of Antler, one of the most active Venture Capital firms globally, is also a husband, father, and Iron Man runner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His journey provides insights into [[worklife_balance_and_risktaking_in_entrepreneurship | balancing a demanding professional life with personal fulfillment]].

## Early Influences and Drive

Magnus grew up on the countryside of Norway in a tiny community of about 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. A pivotal moment occurred at age seven or eight when a family member's passing led him to ponder the meaning of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06]">[00:07:06]</a>. This experience sparked a drive to "do something impactful" with his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18]">[00:08:18]</a>.

Another key moment was discovering United World Colleges (UWC) at age 12 or 13 through a newspaper article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57]">[00:08:57]</a>. Despite being told he was too young and facing tough competition for scholarships, this became a significant drive for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55]">[00:09:55]</a>. He consciously worked on developing the necessary skills, excelling in sports, academics, and community service (like the Red Cross), ultimately securing a scholarship to UWC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01]">[00:10:01]</a>. He views this as a "preparatory phase" for future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33]">[00:11:33]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurial Journey

Magnus's career path followed a traditional route for bright students: Ivy League (Harvard), management consulting (McKinsey), and then entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20]">[00:17:20]</a>. He admits that if he could give his 18-year-old self advice today, he would suggest doing things "a little bit quicker" in terms of education and starting a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46]">[00:19:46]</a>. He believes in creating one's own luck by being prepared for opportunities and exposing oneself to as many as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26]">[00:20:26]</a>.

### The Importance of "Front-Loading"
For Magnus, building a business, especially in the first year or two, requires intense dedication and "front-loading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06]">[00:31:06]</a>. This means dedicating 100% of effective time, as co-founders are often the only ones driving the business forward initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48]">[00:31:48]</a>. He advises eliminating "waste" such as excessive Netflix, socializing, or drinking, to focus that energy on the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00]">[00:35:00]</a>. While maintaining family time, training, and sleep is crucial, other distractions should be cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41]">[00:34:41]</a>. This intense period can last two to three years until a strong team is in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00]">[00:36:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Fear of Failure and Rejection
Magnus emphasizes that "delusional self-belief" is not delusional, but rather "incredibly ambitious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30]">[00:29:30]</a>. He believes that to succeed, founders must:
*   **Embrace Hustle**: Entrepreneurs must learn to actively seek out investments, talent, and customers, as these won't magically appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07]">[00:45:07]</a>. This involves getting comfortable with rejection and pursuing opportunities relentlessly, even after multiple "no's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50]">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **Eliminate the Mindset of Failure**: Once a founder decides to start, the fear of failing must be eradicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47]">[00:40:47]</a>. Thinking failure is an option can lead to giving up during difficult moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54]">[00:40:54]</a>. Instead, focus on resilience, as "it's the most resilient team" that often wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17]">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Build Social Pressure**: A personal technique for Magnus is to tell "literally everyone" about his ambitions, creating social pressure that makes failure "not an option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52]">[00:42:52]</a>.
*   **Practice**: Hustling and dealing with rejection can be practiced in everyday life by talking to strangers, asking favors, or sharing personal details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40]">[00:50:40]</a>.

## Personal Life and Family

Magnus had his first child at 22, while still a college student, which meant sacrificing typical college experiences like spring break for changing diapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35]">[00:37:35]</a>. However, he sees having children early as "an amazing thing" because it allows for a longer period of shared interests and understanding as they grow up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56]">[00:37:56]</a>. He feels it made him more mature faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48]">[00:37:48]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of parents exposing children to "moments of potential inspiration" by traveling, visiting museums, reading, and meeting diverse people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50]">[00:14:50]</a>. Forcing someone to accomplish something is temporary; inspiring them creates a lasting desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19]">[00:15:19]</a>.

### Maintaining Well-being
Magnus stresses the importance of understanding personal signals for mental health. For him, regular physical activity is "insanely important" for maintaining mental sharpness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34]">[01:13:34]</a>. He prioritizes workouts, even amidst demanding travel and work schedules, to avoid feeling "less exciting" or "slower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51]">[01:12:51]</a>.

He also believes that open communication and a supportive culture are crucial for preventing burnout in a company, rather than just reducing working hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09]">[01:16:09]</a>. Regular conversations within the leadership team about how things are going can help identify warning signs early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50]">[01:16:50]</a>.

## Defining Success and Purpose

Magnus finds happiness in "purposefulness," feeling that what he does has a real impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26]">[01:30:26]">[01:30:40]</a>. He consciously plans his life in segments:
*   **Long-term Vision**: Regularly thinking about where he wants to be a decade from now, understanding it will slowly change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00]">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **Tiered Planning**: Breaking down the 10-year vision into 5-year, 3-year, 1-year, and 1-month plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31]">[01:31:31]</a>. The monthly plan must be connected to the longer-term goals to ensure progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03]">[01:32:03]</a>.
*   **Three Pillars**: His plan is split into business, family & friends, and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:43]">[01:32:43]</a>.
He reviews these plans monthly during flights and more deeply once a year around Christmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17]">[01:34:17]</a>.

For Magnus, finding purpose is an evolving journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00]">[01:37:00]</a>. He felt he came "closer and closer" throughout his career: from student life to military, academia, consulting, and then building an e-commerce company (Solora) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04]">[01:37:04]</a>. Now, with Antler, he feels fully aligned, spending his time supporting "incredible people in solving important problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41]">[01:37:41]</a>.

### Advice for Discovering Purpose
To help younger individuals discover their purpose quickly, Magnus advises:
*   **Seek Opportunities and Inspiration**: Get out of the box, experience new things (travel, museums, reading, meeting people), and gain as much exposure as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:16]">[01:39:16]</a>.
*   **Be Prepared**: Develop strengths, build mental resilience, and cultivate drive and the ability to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:52]">[01:39:52]</a>. This aligns with [[the_dynamics_and_qualities_of_effective_startup_founders_and_investors | the dynamics and qualities of effective startup founders]].
*   **Make Real Decisions**: Don't just follow the "wave" of circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:36]">[01:40:36]</a>. People often regret not making conscious decisions about their life path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21]">[01:41:21]</a>. If you don't take control, the world will take you somewhere, "and most likely it's not going to be where you want to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:38]">[01:41:38]</a>.
*   **Follow Your Passion**: If purpose isn't immediately clear, follow your passion, as it is most likely to lead you to your purpose over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:54]">[01:41:54]</a>.

His core belief is that "great people spend real time working on solving large problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:32]">[01:42:32]</a>. He sees innovation by talented individuals as the only way to address global challenges like climate change, education, healthcare, and prevent societal regression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52]">[01:43:52]</a>.

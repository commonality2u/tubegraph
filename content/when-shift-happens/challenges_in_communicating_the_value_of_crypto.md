Despite its growing popularity, the crypto space faces significant [[challenges_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges]] in communicating its value and purpose to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. Hunter Horsley, co-founder and CEO of Bitwise, openly admits that he is "still not proud" to say he is in crypto because he finds the space "very cringe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. He emphasizes that this is a "huge miss" that the industry has yet to solve: clearly communicating how the space can improve the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.

## Why Crypto Feels Unpopular Despite Being Popular

Several factors contribute to this perception disconnect:

### Negative Perceptions and Cycles
*   **"Crazy Cycles" and Getting "Burned"**: The crypto industry has experienced volatile cycles where many people have lost money, leading to a negative association and reluctance to re-engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.
*   **"Cringe" Communication**: The way people express themselves in the crypto space is often perceived as unwelcoming and intimidating, deterring new participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. There's a perceived lack of effort from many in the industry to welcome more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

### Lack of Clarity and Reluctance to Advocate
*   **Unclear Purpose**: Many people, including investors, do not understand what crypto stands for or how to explain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   **Reluctance to Discuss**: This confusion leads to a reluctance to discuss crypto publicly, such as at social gatherings, due to uncertainty about how it will be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. If one doesn't know its purpose, they hesitate to "stake ground and advocate for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.
*   **Private Engagement**: As a result, many people engage with crypto privately because they are unsure how to communicate about it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

## The Need for Better Communication

Horsley argues that the crypto space needs to significantly improve its marketing, branding, and communication efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

### Learning from Successes
*   **Coinbase's "Update the System" Campaign**: Hunter praises Coinbase's efforts, particularly their "Update the System" ad campaign, for starting to tell a compelling story on behalf of the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. This campaign highlights common frustrations with traditional finance (e.g., inability to send money on weekends) and positions crypto as a solution to "update the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.
*   **Solana's "Normal Ads"**: Solana is also cited for running "normal ads" that are understandable to a mainstream audience, which is "pretty remarkable" for the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **Mainstream Acceptance Requires Simplicity**: Crypto, like other frontier technologies (e.g., AI, self-driving cars), needs to "get its stuff together" and put forth a clear message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. For mainstream acceptance, it "doesn't get special permission" to use up more of people's time and "have to speak simply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

### Three Core Questions to Address
To become mainstream, crypto must effectively answer three main questions for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>:

1.  **Is it good for society?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>
    *   Answer: It allows individuals to use services and save money without being exploited by companies or governments, which is beneficial for society and future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.
2.  **How can this help my mother?** (i.e., how does it apply to everyday life?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>
    *   People often ask if they can "buy their coffee with Bitcoin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. This question is a request to "show me how this can fit into my day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.
    *   Examples:
        *   Sending money to family abroad instantly, 24/7, with no fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.
        *   Accessing censorship-free social media platforms like Farcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
        *   Buying Bitcoin as a financial planning tool against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.
3.  **How do I use it?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>

## Bitwise's Role in Communication
Bitwise aims to be a "teaching assistant" in the crypto space, helping investors and financial professionals understand it by starting from their questions and providing clear explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>. They believe that if people understand what's happening, they will recognize the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.

## Message to the Crypto Industry
Hunter Horsley's message to the crypto industry and community is to "think bigger," "be more positive," and "think about the good that this space is going to do in the world and focus on that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:52">[01:37:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>.

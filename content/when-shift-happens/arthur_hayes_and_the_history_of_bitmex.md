Arthur Hayes is the co-founder and ex-CEO of [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] and currently serves as the CIO at Maelstrom Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. He is also a popular macroeconomics writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Founding and Early Years of BitMEX

The idea for [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] originated from Arthur Hayes's frustration with existing platforms like ICBit, where he and other [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | traders]] desired improved product offerings, more features, and increased [[building_a_crypto_marketmaking_firm | liquidity]] to facilitate more trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Hayes was confident that [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | Bitcoin derivatives]] and [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | crypto derivatives]] would become a massive market, with a few companies earning substantial profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. His main concern was simply surviving long enough to reach that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

After losing his job in [[transition_from_traditional_finance_to_crypto_and_the_founding_of_tezos | banking]], Hayes began exploring [[history_and_impact_of_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] after reading about it on Zero Hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. He immersed himself in reading everything available, including the [[history_and_impact_of_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] white paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. He discovered ICBit, an exchange run by two anonymous Russian individuals in the Caribbean, which had launched the first [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | futures contracts]] on [[history_and_impact_of_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Hayes found an [[building_a_crypto_marketmaking_firm | arbitrage]] opportunity due to futures contracts trading at a significant premium to the spot price, offering calculated annualized returns of 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. He validated this by sending money to Mt. Gox, buying [[history_and_impact_of_bitcoin | Bitcoin]], selling futures contracts on ICBit, and observing his anticipated profit match the exchange's payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Hayes continued performing [[building_a_crypto_marketmaking_firm | arbitrage]] for several months, notably between China and the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This involved physical transfers: depositing cash in Hong Kong banks, wiring to exchanges like Bitfinex to buy [[history_and_impact_of_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] at international dollar prices, sending it to Chinese exchanges (Huobi, BTC China, OKCoin) to sell for CNY, withdrawing cash from Chinese banks, and transporting it back across the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This unique geographical opportunity in Hong Kong allowed for 20-40% profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

Hayes partnered with Ben D (who built [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_decentralized_exchanges | trading systems]]) and Sam Reed (who built web applications) in early 2014 to build [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The product took 11 months to build, launching in November 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. They launched during a bear market, immediately after the Mt. Gox collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Despite the challenging market, they chose to bootstrap [[insights_into_building_and_managing_a_business_in_the_crypto_industry | BitMEX]] without venture capital, knowing that exchanges could be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This period instilled an ethos of transparency and "not your keys, not your coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. For the first year, [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] had almost zero volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, a disheartening but not confidence-shaking period for Hayes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Innovation and Market Domination

[[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]]'s business strategy adapted by focusing on the Chinese market, where most of the [[history_and_impact_of_bitcoin | crypto]] volume was at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. A significant turning point came in late 2015 when they decided to offer 100x [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | leverage]], surpassing the 20x offered by Chinese exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This move, backed by their superior math and [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_decentralized_exchanges | technology]] for margin management, quickly made [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] known for the highest [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | leverage]] without losing money as an exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This significantly boosted volumes and made them cash-flow positive, enabling them to pay themselves and continue developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

In 2016, [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] introduced the [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | Perpetual Swap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Initially, it was met with significant negative feedback from clients who preferred traditional [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | futures contracts]] and struggled to understand the funding mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Hayes pushed to keep and iterate on the product, believing it was more intuitive and consolidated [[building_a_crypto_marketmaking_firm | liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. By 2017, the [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | Perpetual Swap]] gained traction, leading to massive volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

The "golden moment" for [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] was not the 2017 bull market, but rather the 2018-2019 bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. During this period, when competitors took 1.5 years to adopt similar products, [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] controlled most of the [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | derivative market]] and could charge relatively high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

During this period of intense growth, the company expanded from 10 to over 100 employees in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Hayes's focus shifted to managing [[insights_into_building_and_managing_a_business_in_the_crypto_industry | HR issues]], [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_decentralized_exchanges | scaling technological infrastructure]], and continuously "putting out fires" as the [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_decentralized_exchanges | tech]] struggled to work at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## Challenges During COVID-19

In March 2020, during a sharp market crash triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] faced significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. The exchange was [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_decentralized_exchanges | DDoS'd]], causing it to go offline for about 15 minutes as prices collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Despite popular belief on Twitter, the exchange was not intentionally shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. After the exchange came back online, the market quickly rallied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

This incident was not a good moment for [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] as many users lost significant amounts of money because they did not fully understand how the "exotic derivatives" functioned during extreme downside movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This led to a large exodus of customers from [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] to other platforms that did not use [[history_and_impact_of_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] as a collateral mechanism, which [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] did not offer at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

During the crisis, the focus at [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] HQ was on understanding the problem, fixing it, and then analyzing the damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Meetings were held to discuss customer complaints, but ultimately, [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] adhered to its stated rules, believing that changing policies to favor one group would encourage moral hazard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Hayes stated that they "didn't really do anything" to compensate users, viewing the losses as "just part of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Hayes never considered what [[bybit_exchange_development_and_challenges | BitMEX]] would be like without the COVID-19 crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

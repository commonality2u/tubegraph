Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, creator of Polkadot, and the visionary behind [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web3]], offers insights into the past, present, and future of [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | blockchain technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. His journey into the space began in late 2013, driven by curiosity after encountering the Ethereum white paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.

## The Genesis of Ethereum and Web3

Wood started coding Ethereum in December 2013, with only £500 left for rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. An offer of £1,000 a month allowed him to continue, and a few months later, he became a co-founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He created the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Solidity language, which enables smart contract development on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:3:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

Ethereum's biggest achievement to date, according to Wood, is making the most millionaires of any project in the history of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:3:38">[00:03:38]</a>. However, he questions whether it has achieved "all that much that's useful," or fulfilled his personal metrics for success, which center on utility and freedom from trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.

In 2014, Wood coined the term [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web3]] in an article, defining it as the "post-Snowden web" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. This vision combined decentralization, cryptoeconomics, and a common application platform to enforce guarantees that users believed they were getting from the web, but which had been undermined, particularly concerning privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. Wood emphasizes that [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web3]] avoids the need to trust intermediaries by building from the bottom up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

## Philosophy of Innovation and Problem Solving

Wood describes his approach to big ideas as incremental, combining existing knowledge and components in novel ways to achieve positive, useful, and previously unachieved outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. He distinguishes an "idea" from a high-level goal, stating that a true idea must be constrained by practicalities and have a path to achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:44">[01:54:44]</a>.

### The Challenge of Being Too Early
Wood notes that being too far ahead is akin to being wrong, and he has suffered from being misunderstood due to his early adoption of trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:25">[02:00:25]</a>. He suggests that radical inventions are often initially applied to "ridiculously naive use cases" because people need to understand them in familiar terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:26">[02:14:26]</a>. He compares this to the early internet being primarily used for email, a significantly faster version of traditional mail, before its broader impact was realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:56">[02:21:56]</a>.

### Innovation in Blockchain: Polkadot and Jam
Wood founded Polkadot in late 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. Its original vision was to unite different [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | blockchain architectures]] under a single security umbrella, enabling economic scale by securing many chains for the price of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Polkadot's biggest achievement is delivering a secure sharded [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | blockchain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>.

However, Wood identifies sharding itself as Polkadot's biggest problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. While sharding helps with data separation in databases, it complicates interaction for services like smart contracts, which often need synchronous composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.

His proposed solution to this challenge is the **Join-Accumulate Machine (Jam)**, a project Polkadot will evolve into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. Jam aims to create a "big shared computer that always works exactly how you expect it to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>. It addresses the sharding problem by allowing "ephemeral playgrounds" for smart contracts to interact synchronously on the fly, enabling scalability while maintaining composability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:13">[01:24:13]</a>.

### Challenges in [[identifying_successful_crypto_projects_and_the_importance_of_innovation | Crypto Project Success]]
Wood acknowledges that while building advanced technology is crucial, communication and attention are vital for adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:25">[01:28:25]</a>. He laments the current state of [[investing_in_blockchain_gaming_and_its_potentials | crypto]], which he sees largely as "degenerates gambling" on meme coins rather than investing in infrastructure builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:25">[01:45:25]</a>. He believes this shift has diluted the industry's original focus on technology and foundational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:07">[01:46:07]</a>.

Despite 15 years since Bitcoin's launch, Wood notes the limited mainstream utility of [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | crypto]], primarily to cross-border payments, speculative store of value, and gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:02">[01:50:02]</a>. He attributes this to the difficulty in educating people about the value of "trust-free" services, especially when direct financial savings are not immediately obvious (e.g., for everyday purchases) or when institutions are perceived as trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:55">[01:52:55]</a>.

## AI and Decentralization: A Divergent Path

Wood tweeted, "AI: More trust, less truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:32">[02:07:32]</a>. He sees AI as a fundamental change in human communication, where interactions will increasingly be intermediated by networked, potentially for-profit, and government-controlled AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>. He fears this could lead to a world where AI acts as an "Overlord," altering communications and even software in imperceptible ways, driven by an imperative for self-persistence and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:51">[02:18:51]</a>.

He expresses skepticism about the economic viability of decentralizing AI in the crypto ecosystem, particularly through [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | blockchain-based]] AI models or edge computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:09">[02:26:09]</a>. He believes AI is fundamentally centralized, with power increasing through concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:35">[02:28:35]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the principles of [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web3]], which aim to avoid the need to trust intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:10">[02:09:10]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Driving Forces

Wood' identifies his personal mission as contributing to principles that seem worthwhile, particularly those of Enlightenment liberalism—the optimistic view that improved human knowledge leads to better human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:57">[03:02:57]</a>. This includes a desire to broadly bolster education and human understanding of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:51">[03:56:51]</a>.

He stepped down as CEO of Parity Technologies in 2022 to refocus on intelligent discourse, ideation, and development, away from the stresses of running a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:41">[02:29:41]</a>. Wood states that he has "never particularly cared about money," always prioritizing curiosity and intellectual and physical freedom over financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:21">[02:39:21]</a>. He believes money can buy comfort and opportunities, but not love, time, health, or freedom itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:11">[02:44:11]</a>.

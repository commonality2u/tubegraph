PayPal has introduced a new service allowing eligible customers in the UK to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies directly from their PayPal accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This move is considered significant given PayPal's extensive reach, with its revenue for Q2 reaching $6.24 billion USD and a user base of 377 million as of late 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Available Cryptocurrencies and Minimum Purchase
The service supports four major cryptocurrencies:
*   Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Bitcoin Cash (a fork of the original Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Litecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

Users can begin purchasing with as little as one pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## [[Process of buying cryptocurrency with PayPal | The Purchasing Process]]
The process of buying cryptocurrency through the PayPal app is designed to be straightforward:
1.  **Open the PayPal App**: Users start by opening their PayPal application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Crypto Section**: A dedicated "crypto section" is available within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
3.  **Select "Buy and Sell Crypto"**: Clicking on this option leads to the selection of cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
4.  **Choose Cryptocurrency**: Users can select from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, or Litecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. For example, to buy Ethereum, one would click on it, view its price chart, and then click "buy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Tax Residency**: The app prompts users to confirm their US tax residency status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
6.  **Acknowledge Risks**: A warning about funds being at risk is displayed, emphasizing the importance of understanding the risks and regulations involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
7.  **Verification (KYC)**: As a centralized service, PayPal already has user details such as bank account information and address, minimizing additional Know Your Customer (KYC) steps for existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
8.  **Review Fees**: Users can see the fee structure before confirming a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## [[Comparison of fees for cryptocurrency purchases on PayPal | Fees and Costs]]
The fee structure for purchasing cryptocurrency on PayPal is a flat 50 pence (50p) for purchases of £1 and £10 worth of cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. While this fee is 50% of a £1 purchase, it becomes more "palatable" for larger amounts like £10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## [[Limitations of using PayPal for cryptocurrency transactions | Current Limitations]]
Currently, PayPal's cryptocurrency service has several limitations:
*   **No Peer-to-Peer Transfers**: Users cannot send cryptocurrency directly to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **No Payments**: Cryptocurrency held on PayPal cannot be used to pay for goods or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Centralized Control**: As a centralized platform, PayPal retains control over the funds and assets, meaning users do not receive a private key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This means users must trust PayPal with their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

This service is noted to be "very very basic" and more suited for individuals who want minimal [[speculation_in_cryptocurrency | exposure]] to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, rather than advanced users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It is compared to how Revolut introduced crypto to its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Updates regarding the application's features and terms are expected in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

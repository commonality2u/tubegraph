Nicholas Carey, the visionary behind blockchain.com, offers insights into the [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]], focusing on the significant [[challenges_and_solutions_in_entrepreneurship | challenges]] leaders face during business growth and hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurial Path
Carey emphasizes that starting a business often means facing "pretty much all odds stacked against you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. He notes there's no formal "School of Entrepreneurship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, and the only way to validate an idea is to "go out and try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Everyone can improve at [[building_and_scaling_a_successful_business | building businesses]] with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Key to success is building something useful that people will pay for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, then expanding on that idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Early Experiences
Carey's own entrepreneurial spirit began at 14, working construction in Switzerland to buy DJ decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He learned about inventory management, pricing, and customer service by selling plants found in the ocean to neighbors to buy a Boombox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. In high school, he built websites and e-commerce platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. His first foray into tech entrepreneurship was as the second teammate at Pipeline CRM, where he gained a "crash course" in building company components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. These experiences prepared him for future steps, including his work with Bitcoin starting in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Significant Challenges in Business Growth
When starting a business, particularly in a nascent field like crypto in the early 2010s, it's "even more complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Founders often face many unforeseen challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Apple App Store Ban
An early, frightening challenge for blockchain.com occurred when Apple briefly enacted an "intolerant policy" against crypto apps, removing them from the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This was a "huge challenge" as access to the App Store was crucial for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The company, a tiny startup, faced the daunting task of persuading a tech giant to reverse its decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Fortunately, Apple reversed the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### Revenue Concentration Risk
Carey recalls a [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | previous business]] where one customer accounted for 50% of all revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This created "Revenue concentration risk," where the client could dictate terms or demand specific features, biasing the product's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Losing such a client leaves the company with significant baggage and a product potentially tailored to a single, now-gone customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

### Crypto Market Volatility
The cryptocurrency space is characterized by cycles of "bull runs and then bear markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Over ten years, Carey has witnessed over seven eras where crypto prices dropped by over 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. His prior business experiences and accumulated resilience helped navigate these "crazy markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Scaling a Business and Hiring
Blockchain.com has raised over $500 million from venture capital, private equity, and institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Raising capital increases the "responsibility envelope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. The goal is to grow the business's scope, aiming to expand cryptocurrency adoption from hundreds of millions to billions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Investments are primarily made in people, who in turn improve products, grow the business, and add organizational capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

### Hiring Challenges
Finding the best people passionate about the mission is a universal challenge for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. Given that every dollar spent is precious, business owners seek a high return on investment in hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. The process requires extensive recruitment, proper onboarding, and nurturing talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Blockchain.com receives over 100,000 applications annually, attracting top talent from major tech and financial firms due to novel challenges and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
Key hiring criteria include:
*   Value fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>
*   Significant moral caliber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>
*   Ability to be thoroughly vetted and referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>
A good internal bar is whether you would enthusiastically hire someone again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

### Layoffs
In times of economic contraction or recession, companies must adapt their cost structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. Letting go of teammates is "one of the hardest things a Founder can ever do," especially after the colossal effort to find the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. In the crypto space, these cycles of expansion and contraction happen faster than in the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

## Mental Health and Leadership
Entrepreneurship can be "particularly taxing" for individuals prone to anxiety or stress, as many unforeseen things will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Carey emphasizes the importance of a healthy relationship with work, which for him was initially "completely all-consuming" with personal consequences, including sleep issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### The Impact of Entrepreneurial Life
[[challenges_and_responsibilities_in_financial_investment_and_entrepreneurship | Entrepreneurial life]] can significantly impact mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Overwhelming stress can lead to trouble sleeping, health consequences, and clouded judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. There is "too much idolization of these grandiose characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a> who seem to have superpowers without consequences.

### Personal Strategies for Well-being
Carey's personal program for maintaining mental health includes:
*   **Routine**: Immediately helpful morning routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
*   **Exercise**: Physical activity, especially long-distance running, helps create positive stress and a methodical way to process challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Nutrition**: Thoughtful eating is crucial for biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
*   **Gratitude**: Expressing gratitude in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.
*   **Addressing Issues**: Identifying and resolving physical issues, like his sleep condition, with professional help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
*   **Support Network**: Having a strong support network of long-term friends, family, or community members to talk to openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

### Red Flags and Warning Signs
Leaders should pay attention to:
*   **Physical health indicators**: Consistent tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Behavioral changes**: Snapping at people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.
*   **Physical environment**: A messy personal environment can reflect a messy state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   **Denial**: The belief that "the business is a priority" above personal well-being is a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

[!NOTE]
The "work to yourself the death" culture is "stupid" because "if you're dead you can't work on your project no one's going to care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.

### Mindset for Overcoming Challenges
Carey advocates for a "learning perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, viewing problems as "opportunities" to learn and overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | mindset]] allows leaders to appreciate the journey and accumulate lessons to apply to future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Journaling, podcasting, and sharing stories with friends are ways to take stock of lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Building Resilience
Resilience can be built through consistent practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. Physical challenges, like training for a marathon, are excellent ways to build mental resilience that can be applied to entrepreneurial challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. The discipline required to run a marathon every year for 30 years illustrates the compounding gains of consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

> "The practice of discipline, the gains you get are, you know, kind of grow incrementally, it's compounded." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>

It's vital to develop good habits early on and maintain that discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Telling others your goals and asking them to hold you accountable can also help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. When setbacks occur, it's important to "amend yourself and... get back on the program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

## Leadership Style and Development
Becoming a business leader involves cultivating a unique leadership style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. This progresses from being a good individual contributor, to effective management (getting others to perform), to visionary leadership (setting strategic alignment and crafting a future vision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. The ability to influence and encourage teammates to do their best work is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. This aligns with [[servant_leadership_and_its_impact_on_business_culture | servant leadership]] principles, focusing on nurturing talent and helping them achieve their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

In tough times, leaders must move out of "wartime mode" back into "peacetime mode" to repair energy reserves and empower other leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. Setting the right example prevents burnout and maintains motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Entrepreneurship
Carey summarizes his biggest lessons:
*   **Entrepreneurship as a Vehicle for Change**: It's an "exciting and full vehicle for changing and improving the state of the world in society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Open and Optimistic Mindset**: Maintain this throughout the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Obstacles as Opportunities**: "The obstacles are the path" and challenges are opportunities to learn and overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Solving enough problems leads to a resilient, successful, and sustainable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Learning Mindset**: Acknowledge that you don't have all the answers and be open to learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
*   **Perseverance**: "Never, ever, ever give up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>, balanced with maintaining health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

> "You can't fail if you if you don't stop and you have to have an adaptive mindset." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>

## Controversial Ideas
Carey believes that the idea of [[challenges_and_strategies_in_launching_and_scaling_a_crypto_startup | building a better form of money]] is one of the most controversial ideas in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. He views traditional financial institutions as old systems designed to perpetuate power without public consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer a more efficient, principle-based, and equitable way to exchange wealth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. This perspective challenges mainstream consensus and the designs of traditional currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.

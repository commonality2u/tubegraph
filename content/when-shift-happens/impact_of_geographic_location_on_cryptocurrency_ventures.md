Geographic location plays a significant role in cryptocurrency ventures, influencing investment strategies, team building, and the overall success of projects. James B, the founder of Digital Finance Group and J Square, highlights how global travel and localized approaches are crucial for navigating the diverse landscape of the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:04]</a>.

## Global Perspective and Localized Strategies
Traveling to conferences and meeting new projects and people with different ideas is highly useful for gaining insights into the future of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:14">[02:12:14]</a>. This includes understanding the specific policies a country has towards cryptocurrency, which can greatly influence investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

It is important to consider a country's population size and future buying power when evaluating potential [[investment_opportunities_in_crypto | crypto investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:59">[03:12:59]</a>. While decentralization is a core principle of crypto, the reality is that being localized in a specific country can help a project perform better due to understanding local dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. If a local market is substantial and a project dominates it, it can represent a strong [[investment_opportunities_in_crypto | investment opportunity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:01">[03:59:01]</a>.

### Building a Global Team
To overcome geographical limitations, it is essential to ask local people for help and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. James B's firm employs people in key locations such as New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, and is expanding to India and Japan to assist with deal sourcing and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Collaborating with partners or investing in projects based in specific countries also provides valuable local advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. When hiring for these roles, a proven track record of finding good projects in crypto is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## Singapore as a Crypto Hub
James B moved to Singapore in 2021 due to mainland China's unsupportive stance on crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:56:11">[0:56:11]</a>. Singapore offers several advantages for crypto businesses and individuals:
*   **Language**: Many people in Singapore speak Mandarin, which can be beneficial for Chinese business people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:56:54">[0:56:54]</a>.
*   **Policy**: The country has a very friendly policy towards cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:57:14">[0:57:14]</a>.
*   **Environment**: Singapore is described as a very clean, safe, and modern financial center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:57:17">[0:57:17]</a>. It is considered one of the safest places globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:58:16">[0:58:16]</a>.

Compared to China's policy risks and the perceived unsafety in parts of the U.S., Singapore provides a stable and conducive environment for living and conducting business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:58:20">[0:58:20]</a>.

## The Power of Localization for Layer One Protocols
Beyond just technology, the ability of a Layer One protocol to achieve adoption by being localized in a specific market is highly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. Examples include projects performing well in India and Japan by focusing on localized adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. People often underestimate the power of localization, tending to follow mainstream [[venture_capital_in_the_crypto_space | VCs]] and only invest in well-known projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. However, having an independent thesis allows investors to identify the value in other protocols that prioritize local market penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>.

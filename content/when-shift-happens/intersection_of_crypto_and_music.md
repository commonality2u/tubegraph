Jay Kurahashi-Sof, CMO at Ava Labs, has a background spanning electronic music, photography, and marketing. His journey highlights the evolving relationship between creative industries and the world of blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Jay Kurahashi-Sof's Journey and Priorities

Jay's early career involved saying "yes to everything," from professional street photography and electronic music DJing to festival organizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He later realized this approach led to mediocrity and a lack of specific expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This led him to step back and prioritize, focusing on what would "reap a ton of benefit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

He structured his life around three core "pillars":
1.  **Sleep:** Considered foundational, if sleep is not addressed, other priorities suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Jay improved his sleep hygiene, moving from 4-5 hours to a more consistent 7 hours per night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  **Work:** Primarily marketing in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
3.  **Creativity:** Initially included music and photography, but he prioritized photography due to a steeper learning curve in music and more immediate success in photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
4.  **Relationships:** As an extrovert, Jay derives energy from intimate, platonic, and professional relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

This framework allows for a "push and pull" balance; if work is intense, other areas need to be scaled back to avoid burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The cyclical nature of crypto with bull and bear markets can "force" a return to a more normal life, prompting individuals to seek happiness and dopamine from activities outside of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This balancing act has prevented the deterioration of health and happiness experienced when priorities were unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Connecting Music and Crypto

Jay is exploring opening a music venue in New York, aiming to prioritize culture over "capitalistic pressures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. He draws inspiration from Berlin's nightlife, where clubs like Sisyphus maintain long lines with low entry fees, driven by culture rather than expensive tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The goal is to create an inclusive space, akin to New York's Public Records, where both underground music enthusiasts and newcomers can enjoy the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Jay leverages his diverse background to bridge creative and technological worlds:
*   **Photography and Production:** His photography experience allows him to work more empathetically with designers and creative directors, fostering collaboration rather than dictating terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **Music Contacts:** His past in music has enabled Avalanche to produce events globally, inviting DJs he knows to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Artist Integration:** Jay aims to show artists how blockchain, specifically NFTs, can benefit their careers and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This involves actively engaging with artists to understand their needs and adapt product directions accordingly, rather than simply presenting a pre-made solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Ava Labs' "Avaissance" Program
Ava Labs launched "Avaissance," an artist grants program focused on empowering up-and-coming artists to utilize blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. The program provides curriculum and support, shaping its direction through close collaboration with artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. This approach fosters a collaborative spirit, where legitimate artists see Ava Labs not as a "quick cash grab" but as a sponsor willing to help realize their dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## [[Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto | Challenges and Opportunities]] for Artists in Crypto
Artists interested in NFTs face the risk of damaging their brand if they don't understand the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Jay warns against "get-rich-quick schemes" and emphasizes that true value in crypto requires understanding beyond the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. He compares it to driving an F1 car; no one would "floor it" without understanding, yet people often do so with crypto because "numbers on a screen" don't feel "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

### "Aping into Things"
A common pitfall in crypto is "aping into things," a term referring to the impulsive, unthinking behavior of jumping into a rising asset or project, often driven by dopamine chasing during bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. This can lead to significant losses, even if the initial investment sees a substantial gain, due to holding too long or making subsequent rash decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

## Jay's Crypto Beginnings and Career Progression
Jay's engagement with crypto began around 2011 as a "huge nerd" with access to information online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. He initially dismissed Bitcoin as a "scam" but later used it to buy a fake ID on the Silk Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. An unexpected appreciation of his leftover Bitcoin sparked further interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

His real understanding developed around 2014 with Ethereum, as the concept of applications made more sense than Bitcoin's financial aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. The idea of removing "inefficiencies of the middleman" resonated with his digital native mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The involvement of Fortune 100/500 clients further legitimized the space for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. He became an expert in the field, often being the only person in his building who could clearly articulate Bitcoin and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

This led him to a marketing role at a major agency, focusing on blockchain and crypto marketing, and then becoming Head of Marketing for Fluidity in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. He joined Ava Labs in May 2020, just as the company was launching Avalanche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.

His passion for marketing stemmed from accidentally building a music publication with a million annual readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. He realized that the success was driven by "digital marketing" and that underlying "strategy" existed beyond simply posting on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. He views marketing as "professional storytelling" across multiple channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.

## Insights and Future Outlook
Jay's key learnings in crypto as a builder and investor include:
*   **Don't take things at face value:** This was a hard lesson learned, especially during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
*   **"Nobody knows anything":** Even supposed experts should be approached with caution; always take a step back and gather information from multiple sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.
*   **The industry as "high school":** Crypto can be petty and childish, with "clicks" and "tribes," and much of what appears online is manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

### Future of Avalanche
Ava Labs is focusing on three primary areas:
1.  **Enterprises:** Engaging with corporate clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
2.  **Ava Cloud:** A fully managed blockchain service allowing enterprises to deploy blockchain solutions in minutes without needing a full engineering team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. Unlike Amazon's offerings, Ava Cloud's direct integration with the Avalanche protocol development team allows for faster reactions and a better performance stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
3.  **Avaissance:** The artist grants program, focusing on NFT artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

These initiatives reflect a strategic approach to growth, combining technological advancement with community and cultural engagement.

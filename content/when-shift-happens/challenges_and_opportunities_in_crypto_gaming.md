## Introduction
The [[cryptocurrencies_and_nfts_in_gaming | crypto gaming]] sector has faced skepticism, with many believing it is a "dead" concept that will never work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. However, proponents argue that its past failures stem from improper execution rather than inherent flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The initial hype around [[impact_of_crypto_gaming_on_adoption_and_economy | crypto gaming]], social, and AI was perhaps "too early" for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

## Current State and Past Issues
Traditional video games have long featured synthetic marketplaces and economies, such as the auction house in World of Warcraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. However, these in-game economies were entirely digital and did not offer real-world value to players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. The challenge for [[impact_of_crypto_gaming_on_adoption_and_economy | crypto gaming]] has been to transition these synthetic systems into real, value-generating economies for users.

## Opportunities and New Approaches
The key to unlocking the potential of [[impact_of_crypto_gaming_on_adoption_and_economy | crypto gaming]] lies in executing "play to earn" models effectively and, crucially, making them enjoyable for players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

### Sofon's Strategy
Sofon, a consumer crypto platform, aims to onboard the next generation of crypto users by integrating crypto into everyday tech habits, including gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.
Instead of building for "crypto-native users," Sofon focuses on consumer-centric design and ease of use, making the crypto elements invisible to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

Sofon's approach to gaming includes:
*   **Rewarding individual players**: Games on Sofon allow players to earn rewards, often from in-game advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. This shifts the dynamic from "player vs. player" (PVP) zero-sum games, where one must lose for another to win, to "player vs. environment" (PVE) positive-sum ecosystems where "everybody's winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.
*   **Integrating with existing Web2 games**: Sofon prioritizes partnerships with traditional mobile gaming companies that already have large user bases and proven products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>. This strategy aims to introduce crypto elements into games that millions already enjoy, rather than expecting users to adopt new, crypto-first games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>.
    *   **Example: Trial Extreme**: This mobile game, with hundreds of millions of downloads and millions of monthly active users, will integrate crypto in its backend for payments and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>. This can include an advertising element within the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a>. The success of such integrations could inspire other mobile games to adopt crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>.
*   **Leveraging ZKTLS**: Zero-Knowledge TLS (ZKTLS) is a technology that allows users to verifiably prove data they generate on a blockchain while preserving privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. This "invisible technology" can be a "massive Trojan horse for crypto and consumer" adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>. In gaming, ZKTLS can enable:
    *   **Monetization of attention**: Players can earn from their in-game activities and data without explicit knowledge of crypto mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.
    *   **Proof of loyalty and achievements**: Users can build a verified profile of their achievements, badges, and loyalty across various applications without revealing personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>. This allows for features like leaderboards and seasons, common in gaming, to have a real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
    *   **Targeted rewards**: Companies can use this privacy-preserving data to reward users directly for specific habits, like playing a certain game or engaging with particular content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The ability to make in-game economies "real" through tokenization and blockchains means that "people could make a living by farming stuff in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>. This paradigm shift could fundamentally change how people interact with games and derive value from their digital engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. The industry needs to focus on creating an environment where builders can experiment and develop "breakout moments" â€” single applications that can drive adoption for an entire blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

[[The evolution of the gaming industry through blockchain | Crypto gaming]] is identified as a significant catalyst for mass adoption within the cryptocurrency space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. It has the potential to change the lives of many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> and is considered the likely path to bringing millions of new users onto the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

## Xborg: A Case Study in Gaming Identity

Louie, the founder and CEO at Xborg, describes the platform as the world's largest player identity protocol in the gaming world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. His personal interest in gaming, which was a big part of his life from ages 12 to 17, influenced his decision to build a gaming protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.

### What is Xborg?
Xborg is essentially building an online CV (Curriculum Vitae) for gamers, known as the "Xbo ID" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This tool combines a player's online activities, such as the number of games played and kills made in a specific game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

The Xbo ID is integrated into ecosystems, providing gamers with benefits like:
*   Whitelisting for specific gaming project opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>.
*   Investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
*   NFT mints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   Giveaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

The long-term vision for Xborg is to empower a million players initially, then scale to become the most prominent identity system for gamers, even in the Web2 world, with the ultimate goal of disrupting the entire gaming market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.

### Value of Online Identity in Gaming
An online identity in gaming, like the Xbo ID, is valuable for several reasons:
*   **Proof of Identity/Personhood** It serves as a verifiable proof of identity and personhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Combating Bots and Cheating** For game developers, a major challenge is fighting bots and cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. By linking a player's identity to their profile, developers can verify if a person is legitimate, has connected accounts, and is vouched for by various communities, ensuring they are not abusing the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. This is also crucial for Esports and casual tournaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Customized Player Experiences** The next generation of web experiences is expected to be highly customized, treating each user as a unique customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Xborg provides the infrastructure for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
*   **Targeted Engagement for Developers** Game developers can leverage this identity to understand players' histories, allowing them to target specific users with tailored experiences, email sequences, or giveaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. For example, knowing a new player is a top FPS player from Counter-Strike or Call of Duty makes them a very valuable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. This has led to significant traction from game developers, Esports teams, and brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

## Role in Mass Adoption and Economic Impact
Gaming is seen as the sector that will bring the next millions of people on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. It is considered the major catalyst for mass adoption, even more so than Artificial Intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. The integration of blockchain technology in gaming is seen as a way to empower individuals financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, particularly given that 40% of the global population is unbanked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. The potential for gaming to change lives and have a significant impact on the crypto space is a primary motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

Gaming tokens have also shown strong performance in the market, similar to AI tokens, especially around major conferences like GDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. This indicates a growing economic interest and investment in the crypto gaming sector.

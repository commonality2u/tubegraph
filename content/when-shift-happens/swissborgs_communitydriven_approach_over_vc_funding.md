[[Defi and smart yield program by Swissborg | Swissborg]], a crypto wealth management company based in Switzerland, differentiates itself through a unique approach: prioritizing community loyalty and transparency over traditional venture capital (VC) funding. This strategy has allowed Swissborg to navigate the volatile crypto market with integrity, focusing on long-term sustainability rather than short-term gains driven by external financial pressures.

## The Genesis of Swissborg's Approach

Swissborg was founded six years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a> by co-founder Anthony and his friend Cyrus, whom he met at age 18 in Monaco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. In late 2016, Anthony, initially skeptical of Bitcoin, began to seriously investigate cryptocurrencies after a friend urged him to look into Dash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. He found it difficult to purchase crypto, which highlighted a market gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

Swissborg ultimately chose not to raise capital from [[Venture capital in the crypto space | VCs]]. Instead, they successfully raised $50 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in early 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. This decision was partly because, at that time, no VC would have backed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

## Critiquing the VC Model

Anthony expresses a fundamental disagreement with the way most VCs invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. He believes that VCs often fail to grasp the true value in the new economy, which extends beyond traditional financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of:
*   **Loyalty, Brand, and Community:** In a world where technology's barrier to entry is plummeting, the lasting value of any business will reside in its brand, loyalty, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
*   **Ease of Asset Transfer in Crypto:** Unlike traditional stocks, crypto assets can be moved instantly between platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. This necessitates a different approach to value measurement than VCs currently employ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
*   **Focus on Profitability vs. Turnover:** Many VC-backed companies are not profitable, even after listing, because VCs are often more interested in their own turnover (selling stocks to the next investor) than in fostering a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. This creates a "blueprint" for listing non-profitable companies, which can lead to significant market distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Incentives:** The VC game can incentivize founders the "wrong way," leading them to prioritize quick exits (IPO or acquisition) over building sustainable, long-term companies aligned with their original mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:59">[01:06:59]</a>. Anthony cites Mark Zuckerberg's decision not to sell Facebook early on as an example of a founder resisting such pressure to build a lasting vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>.

## The Smart Yield Program and Bear Market Resilience

Swissborg's commitment to its community and long-term thinking was profoundly tested during the 2022 bear market. In late 2020, Swissborg launched its "Smart Yield" program, a passive income product built transparently on [[Defi and smart yield program by Swissborg | Decentralized Finance (DeFi)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.
*   **Transparency as a Core Value:** Unlike competitors who used crypto to invest in traditional leveraged finance, Swissborg committed to full transparency, showing users exactly where their money was invested on the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.
*   **Rapid Growth:** The Smart Yield program was a massive success, growing from zero to $1.5 billion in assets under management (AUM) within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Resisting Unsustainable Yields:** As DeFi yields normalized, Swissborg's rates dropped to 6-8%, while competitors like Celsius, Voyager, and FTX continued to offer unsustainably high yields (e.g., 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>. Swissborg refused to engage in this "yield chasing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.
*   **Community Trust vs. Short-Term Gains:** Despite losing a significant portion of its AUM (from $1.5 billion to $300 million) as users migrated to platforms offering higher, but riskier, returns, Swissborg stood firm on its principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.
*   **Survival Amidst Collapse:** The absence of VC pressure was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. Anthony believes that if VCs had backed Swissborg, they would have pushed the company to match competitors' yields, likely leading to their collapse, as was the fate of many VC-backed lending platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.
*   **VCs Misunderstanding Investment:** Many VCs hire individuals from payment companies, expecting them to "scale investment" linearly, like a payment system. However, investment is not linear; managing $1 billion is vastly different from managing $10 million. This fundamental misunderstanding contributes to failures in the VC-backed investment space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>.

## Building for the Long Term

Swissborg's success in navigating the bear market and its continued growth are attributed to its steadfast commitment to:
*   **Loyalty and Trust:** Engaging honestly with its community fosters loyalty and trust, which is paramount in the crypto space where assets can be moved instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>.
*   **Rethinking Value:** The company aims to redefine how financial success is measured, looking beyond just price and market cap to include the true value created by entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>.
*   **Accelerating Movements:** Crypto can "hack" the system by incentivizing people to try new experiences, accelerating adoption and fostering a more engaged community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>. This aligns with [[The importance of community and longterm thinking in the crypto industry | Swissborg's core value]] of nurturing a dedicated community over quick financial gains.

By prioritizing transparency, community, and long-term vision, Swissborg demonstrates an alternative model to the prevalent VC-driven approach, proving resilience and fostering deeper relationships with its users.

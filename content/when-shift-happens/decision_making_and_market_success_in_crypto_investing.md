From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

The crypto market, once perceived as a place where success could be achieved through luck, has evolved into a more challenging environment where informed [[investing_in_crypto_and_identifying_market_opportunities | decision-making]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Key decisions at different points in time can lead to vastly different outcomes, potentially altering returns by 10x or 20x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Arthur Chang, founder and CIO of Defiance Capital, a leading liquid crypto fund, emphasizes the importance of strategic choices in navigating this complex landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Defining Success: Outperforming Bitcoin

For a crypto fund to be considered among the best, it should significantly outperform Bitcoin over a two to three-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. If Bitcoin gains 100% to 200%, the fund aims for 300% to 400% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This goal becomes increasingly challenging with larger amounts of capital under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Outperforming Bitcoin is Difficult
> Outperforming Bitcoin is extremely difficult for funds, especially those managing over $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The primary reason is that investors seek returns beyond what simple Bitcoin holding offers, meaning funds cannot simply hold Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Bitcoin dominance has been high, and even projects like Solana, despite significant growth, underperformed Bitcoin in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Historically, around 80% of crypto funds (liquid or venture) fail to outperform Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This mirrors traditional finance, where 96% of funds can't beat the S&P 500's buy-and-hold strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

For individual investors, outperforming Bitcoin is doable if they are full-time traders managing less than $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. However, many full-time investors still failed to outperform Bitcoin in 2023 due to being overexposed to Ethereum and other Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Maturity

The crypto market is maturing, with participants becoming more efficient and ruthless in selling underperforming assets and moving to opportunities with potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This means capital is increasingly aware of opportunity costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Narratives that don't show results within approximately one year are often ignored or become subject to skepticism, contrasting with earlier times when the market was more patient (e.g., Ethereum's long transition to Proof-of-Stake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Rebuilding and Conviction

Making a comeback in crypto, especially after significant market downturns, is driven by a deep sense of self-belief and a never-ending desire to prove one's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. Building a crypto fund to nine figures twice, under different and arguably more difficult market conditions, is extremely validating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">[02:00:09]</a>. [[the_challenges_and_rewards_of_crypto_investing | Crypto investing]] is like a competitive sport, where the differences in outcomes (success or failure) are compounded significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. For example, the difference between top and bottom-performing funds in crypto can be as high as 17x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07">[02:22:07]</a>.

### Extreme Risk Tolerance and Conviction
To survive the inevitable "horrible moments" and cycles in crypto, one needs extreme risk tolerance and the ability to not let market fluctuations overly affect day-to-day life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:47">[02:44:47]</a>. Conviction is built by understanding crypto's first principles: what truly attracts you to the space beyond just making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. Identifying the fundamental value propositions provides confidence that the industry will endure and grow, regardless of short-term setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>.

> [!TIP] Fundamental Value Propositions
> Crypto excels in a few narrow use cases by reducing artificial friction created by human social constructs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>. It's a technology that compounds good ideas, products, and people faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>. Examples include:
> *   **Permissionless access to money and cross-border transfers via stablecoins:** This enables massive growth despite regulatory hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:08">[02:37:08]</a>.
> *   **Fundraising and organizational capabilities:** Crypto and blockchain are essential for coordinating human governance and realizing concepts like "Network States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Key Investment Sectors and Strategies

Current [[investment_strategies_in_crypto_market | investment strategies]] focus primarily on three sectors: Layer 1s, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.

### Layer 1s: Solana vs. Ethereum
*   **Solana (SOL):** Medium to long-term, Solana has a "very decent chance" (around 50%) of overtaking Ethereum in market cap within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This is due to its clear objective of scaling via hardware and its focus on consumer use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. While Solana has experienced significant growth and high Bitcoin dominance recently, it still underperformed Bitcoin in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Short-term, Solana may need time to digest its past gains and transfer ownership to new holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The launch of a Solana ETF, especially with major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, would be a significant bullish factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Ethereum (ETH):** The approach to Ethereum's technical roadmap has not changed, but the market and industry have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The market is now prioritizing performance more than absolute decentralization, provided there's sufficient censorship resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Ethereum's strategy of delegating consumer adoption to Layer 2s means the success of Layer 2s does not directly translate to the success of ETH as an asset on a one-to-one basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. When users can pay gas fees in stablecoins on Layer 2s, their attachment to ETH as an asset is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Furthermore, internal debates within the Ethereum community regarding the monetary premium of ETH further complicate its investment case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
DeFi is a favored sector due to its enduring nature and real-world use cases, unlike other narratives such as metaverse, NFTs, gaming, or DAOs, which have shown less staying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. DeFi continues to produce growth and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. The changing interest rate cycle, moving from increases to decreases, also makes DeFi more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Examples like Aave already show fundamental metrics above their 2021 all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] DeFi Investment Approach
> Defiance Capital's [[investment_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | investment approach]] to DeFi is not driven by past bias, despite prior successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. They were underweight DeFi for most of 2023 to early 2024, only significantly increasing exposure when valuations hit "nonsensical rock bottom," indicating an objective assessment of the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Key DeFi bets include:
> *   **Aerodrome (AERO):** Considered the "economic engine of Base," it's seen as the best way to gain exposure to the Base ecosystem, which is unlikely to launch its own token soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
> *   **Hyperliquid (HYPE):** A leading decentralized perpetual exchange, it is seen as a potential disruptor to centralized exchanges, with a potential Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of $50-100 billion just for its perps and spot DEX capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Its fair launch model and the team's commitment to buying back tokens from the open market foster strong community belief, distinguishing it from projects with VC-led launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
> *   **Ethena (ENA):** While its launch valuation was high and involved VCs, it was a necessary evil to secure integration with centralized exchanges crucial for its game plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. It became attractive once the market corrected its valuation to a more reasonable level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Crypto AI is considered a "must-play" due to the unique environment it provides for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Crypto is the only space where millions are thrown at "crazy ideas" for AI, accelerating innovation and discovering novel uses for powerful AI models beyond traditional applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The lack of restrictions in crypto allows for explorations that might be illegal or socially unacceptable in traditional settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Key AI bets include:
*   **Virtuals (VIRT):** The leading AI agent protocol, it kicked off the entire AI agent movement by providing infrastructure for others to build upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Its potential growth depends on the number of successful AI agents built on its protocol, with a potential $20-30 billion valuation in the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Virtuals also benefits from a first-mover advantage and continuous improvement of its AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Grass (GRASS):** This project focuses on collecting valuable live, private data for AI models through a decentralized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Users can install a browser extension to contribute bandwidth and scrape data, which is crucial for training advanced AI models that have already digested most public information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. This model provides a scalable and effective way to gather real-time data, which AI companies pay millions for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

## The Power of Distribution Channels

In the evolving internet and crypto landscape, distribution channels increasingly matter more than solely superior technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. Since crypto technology is open-source and easily copied, the true moat comes from non-tech aspects like strong distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Distribution Channel Impact
> Microsoft Teams, despite being arguably an inferior product, gained significantly more users than Zoom or Slack due to Microsoft's vast distribution network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Similarly, in crypto, platforms with massive user bases, such as Coinbase, Binance, or major crypto wallets (like Metamask or Phantom), are crucial distribution channels that can drive adoption and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## Filtering Signal from Noise in Crypto

[[Investment strategies and managing risk in crypto | Investing]] requires "good judgment" to know when to be flexible and when to stick to core convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This judgment is often an "entrepreneur's instinct" rather than a purely scientific process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Key Elements for Conviction Plays
> When making high-conviction plays, investors consider a combination of factors:
> *   **Fundamentals:** Underlying value and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
> *   **Mindshare/Attention:** How much public attention and community engagement a project commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
> *   **Founder/Team:** The credibility, expertise, and integrity of the project's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. A key indicator of quality founders in the current cycle is a low-key presence on social media, focusing on building rather than constant tweeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
> *   **Narrative:** The prevailing story or trend that can drive interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
> *   **Macro Context/Market Cycle:** The broader economic and crypto market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## The Impact of US Politics on Crypto

The shift in US government administration from "extremely hostile" to "potentially very positive" towards crypto is a structural change that is not yet fully digested by non-US market participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This represents an "impossible scenario" that few imagined a year ago: an industry moving from being actively suppressed to actively promoted by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

This political shift, highlighted by figures like Donald Trump embracing crypto, is expected to drive increased adoption across institutional and retail segments, further solidifying crypto's status as an asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. The appointment of pro-crypto personnel to important government positions, often at a financial sacrifice, further underscores this positive shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This era, particularly the next four years, is seen as a "golden age" for crypto builders, offering an unprecedented environment for serious business and project development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Evolving Crypto Cycles

The classic crypto four-year cycle, traditionally driven by Bitcoin halvings, is becoming less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The marginal decrease in supply from halvings now has less impact on Bitcoin's vast liquidity and trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Bitcoin, as a huge asset class, will increasingly be influenced by traditional market liquidity cycles and broader economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. While cycles can still happen due to human nature pushing things to extremes (e.g., MicroStrategy pulling forward Bitcoin demand), their timing is unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Currently, major "blow-ups" in the market are not anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Advice for Newcomers

> [!INFO] Navigating Crypto Success
> For newcomers, the first test is to discern who to listen to and who to disregard, while always exercising independent judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Success in crypto isn't limited to active trading or chasing "100x" meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Instead:
> 1.  **Play to Your Strengths:** Whether it's building projects, working in the space, or creating content, find the approach that best suits you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
> 2.  **Avoid Borrowed Conviction:** Relying on others' beliefs without your own research rarely works and prevents you from retaining gains or recovering from losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
> 3.  **Filter Signal from Noise:** Be aware that most people's public statements are influenced by their own vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Understand the underlying motivations behind information shared online to discern genuine insights from self-serving narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

[[The psychology behind crypto investments | The psychology behind crypto investments]] highlights that even if luck plays a role initially, sustainable success comes from deep understanding and self-conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

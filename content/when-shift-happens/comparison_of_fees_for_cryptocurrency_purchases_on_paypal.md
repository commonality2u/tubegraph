PayPal has launched a new service enabling eligible customers in the UK to [[paypal_cryptocurrency_services_in_the_uk | buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This service allows users to buy as little as one pound of cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Fee Structure

When engaging in the [[process_of_buying_cryptocurrency_with_paypal | process of buying cryptocurrency]] on PayPal, the fees are structured as follows:

### Minimum Purchase Fee
For the minimum purchase amount of one pound (£1) worth of Ethereum, the fee is 50 pence (50p) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This fee percentage for a one-pound transaction is considered "pretty steep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Fees for Larger Purchases
The fee structure indicates that for a purchase of ten pounds (£10) worth of Ethereum, the fee remains 50 pence (50p) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This flat fee makes larger purchases "a bit more palatable" in terms of percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. For a £10 purchase, the total cost including the fee amounted to £10.50, meaning the 50p fee was applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The pop-up window during the purchase process indicates that the fee is "relevant to the purchase amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, although testing showed it was a flat 50p for £1 and £10 purchases.

## Suitability for Users

The ease of buying cryptocurrency on PayPal is highlighted by the simple process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. However, there are [[limitations_of_using_paypal_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | limitations of using PayPal for cryptocurrency transactions]]. The service is deemed more suitable for individuals who desire "a tiny little bit of exposure" to the crypto ecosystem, rather than advanced users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Currently, users cannot send crypto peer-to-peer or use it for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. This service is comparable to how Revolut introduced crypto to its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

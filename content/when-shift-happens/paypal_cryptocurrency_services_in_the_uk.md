PayPal has officially launched a new service enabling eligible customers in the UK to buy, hold, and sell [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]] directly from their PayPal accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This move is considered significant given PayPal's extensive reach, with revenue reaching $6.24 billion USD in Q2 2020 and a user base of 377 million by the close of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Service Details

The official announcement for the UK launch came on August 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Users can now buy, hold, and sell specific cryptocurrencies with a minimum purchase amount as low as one pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### [[Overview of available cryptocurrencies on PayPal|Available Cryptocurrencies]]

The service supports the following cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>:
*   Bitcoin (BTC)
*   Ethereum (ETH)
*   Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
*   Litecoin (LTC)

### Accessing the Service

Users can access the [[Process of buying cryptocurrency with PayPal|cryptocurrency services]] through the PayPal app on their phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The crypto section is visible on the home screen, allowing users to navigate to buy and sell options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Key Considerations and [[Limitations of using PayPal for cryptocurrency transactions|Limitations]]

Before engaging with the service, users should familiarize themselves with PayPal's frequently asked questions (FAQs) which cover important topics such as whether a separate account is needed, if funds can be sent, and information on private keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Centralization and KYC

As a centralized service, PayPal already possesses user details including bank account information and addresses for existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The process includes Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and confirmation of tax residency status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### [[Comparison of fees for cryptocurrency purchases on PayPal|Fees]]

Transaction fees apply to purchases. For example, buying one pound worth of Ethereum incurs a 50 pence fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This fee remains 50 pence even for purchases of 10 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Risk and Warnings

PayPal includes standard warnings about funds being at risk, advising users to understand the associated risks and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### User Experience and Target Audience

The process of buying [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]] is designed to be very simple and basic, taking only a few clicks to complete a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This simplicity makes it more suited for new users seeking minimal exposure to the [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency|crypto ecosystem]] or those interested in [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto|dollar-cost averaging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

However, the service currently has significant [[Limitations of using PayPal for cryptocurrency transactions|limitations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>:
*   **No Peer-to-Peer Transfers**: Users cannot send [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency]] to other individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **No Payments**: [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency|Cryptocurrency]] cannot be used to pay for goods or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The functionality is similar to how Revolut initially introduced [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency|crypto]] to its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Future updates to the application or terms of service may expand the usability of [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency|crypto]] within the PayPal app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

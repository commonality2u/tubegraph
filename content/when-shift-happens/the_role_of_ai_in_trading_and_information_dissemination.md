Yu, the founder of Kaito AI, a platform focused on the distribution of crypto information, attention, and capital powered by [[The evolution and future of crypto and AI integration | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, discusses the profound [[Impact of AI on daily life and technology | impact of AI]] on financial markets, content creation, and the broader information landscape.

## Kaito AI's Mission
Kaito AI aims to build a platform and system where information and capital can be distributed in a fairer, more transparent, and more efficient way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The company started building Kaito three years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Its name, "Kaito," is a Japanese word meaning "sea" or "ocean," symbolizing the goal to help people navigate the "sea of information" in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

A primary motivation for Kaito's creation was the inefficiency of traditional search engines like Google and platforms like X and Discord for finding reliable crypto information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Yu found it painful to spend too much time on Discord, realizing it's "very painful" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The platform seeks to index everything and make information access more efficient, especially in an industry rife with scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## AI in Trading
Yu's background as a trader significantly influenced Kaito AI's development. He worked at Citadel, a hyper-competitive environment where traders' profit and loss (P&L) are transparently displayed in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This environment fostered a strong sense of ownership and meritocracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

### Citadel's AI Mastery
Citadel, like other hedge funds, has long mastered [[The implications of AI agents on traditional market dynamics | AI capabilities]] to gain an edge in traditional finance, operating "much earlier than a few years" before mainstream awareness of [[The role of AI agents in enhancing productivity and societal roles | AI]] tools like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. They have access to immense amounts of data that others do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. When ChatGPT launched, Citadel automatically integrated it into everyone's workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

Historically, quantitative trading strategies heavily relied on AI, which effectively "killed" human trading based on news, as machines can digest information and react instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. It's still possible for humans to trade profitably, but it requires picking a "battlefield" where one can outperform other strategies or humans, focusing on long-term theses or playing in time horizons where there's less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

### Traditional Finance vs. Crypto Trading
Yu realized the inefficiencies of crypto trading during the 2021 bull market when he was trading crypto during his six-month gardening leave from Citadel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
He noted key differences:
*   **Information Flow**: In traditional finance, information is structured (e.g., SEC filings). In crypto, crucial announcements can come from a founder's Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics**: Traditional equities trading often focuses on mean reversion. Crypto, however, is heavily influenced by momentum, where "things can stay irrational for longer than you can ever exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. This necessitates a framework to understand momentum, mind share, and sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Competition**: In traditional finance, traders compete against institutional players. In crypto, "you need to know very well who you're trading against" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. Many individual traders lack this understanding and often juggle different trading styles, leading to losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.

Yu asserts that if you're building an alpha platform, you shouldn't open access to anyone, as the alpha would decay. Hedge funds maximize value by using internal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This philosophy shaped Kaito's approach to information dissemination in crypto.

## AI in Information Dissemination
Yu's "AI aha moment" occurred in November 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. He immediately recognized it would "fundamentally change how we build the search engine business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

### Impact on Search Engines
AI transforms search by allowing a precise answer to be extracted from a vast amount of data, even if it's buried deep within results. This contrasts with traditional search, where the first few links must provide the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. AI is crucial throughout the entire data pipeline, including ingestion, labeling, and cleaning, not just the user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.

### The Attention Economy
"Attention is the currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, according to Yu. People are heavily influenced by what they see, and this attention has fundamental value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This is particularly true in crypto, where projects with strong fundamentals may fail if they lack attention, as attention drives liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

Web2 platforms (like YouTube, TikTok, X) largely benefit as "attention distributors" from content created by "attention creators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. Only a small minority of creators are compensated, and even then, often minimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. Yu believes this model is unsustainable and will change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.

Elon Musk's strategy of rewarding X users with payouts is a step in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. However, it has unintended consequences, primarily incentivizing more content rather than better content, leading to bot dominance for impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

### [[The intersection of crypto and AI agents | AI Agents]] and Personal Brands
The rise of [[The intersection of crypto and AI agents | AI agents]] like AI xBT highlights the power of distribution and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. AI xBT, despite making mistakes and using old data, gained 350,000 followers and top mind share on Kaito because of its wide distribution and ability to garner attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.
> "The attention is always more valuable than the product you get in return." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>

While personal brands (human connections) are crucial in the [[The role of AI agents in enhancing productivity and societal roles | AI era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>, AI agents pose a unique challenge. AI xBT's constant content generation, even during holidays when human influencers rest, allowed it to dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:10">[01:22:10]</a>. However, its dominance has since decreased, suggesting a balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>.

The unique aspect of AI agents in crypto is their tokenization, creating a massive token holder base that wants them to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. This contrasts with celebrities launching meme coins, which are often risky due to disincentives and lack of utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>.

## Kaito AI's Solution: Yaps and Proof of Attention
Kaito AI is building a token-powered business to solve problems for crypto teams and address the inefficiencies of the KAI (Key Opinion Leader) marketing game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>. Teams historically struggled with KAI mapping, analytics, outreach, and performance evaluation, often overpaying for ineffective attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.

Kaito's solution centers on "Yaps" (tokenized attention) and "Proof of Attention."
*   **Yaps**: Represents tokenized attention, with the aggregate at an account level reflecting tokenized influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>. The algorithm for Yaps heavily disincentivizes farming activities and incentivizes real engagement, original, and creative content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:45">[01:48:45]</a>. This aims to reward genuine contributors rather than farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:48">[01:42:48]</a>.
*   **Mind Share**: Kaito defines mind share as the percentage of voice an individual occupies in people's minds based on their activities, for example, on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>. It's a dynamic metric, evolving as user engagement changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>.
*   **Social Score**: Kaito developed a social score that focuses on quality metrics like "smart followers" rather than just follower count, addressing concerns about fake numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:07">[01:54:07]</a>.
*   **Proof of Attention On-chain**: Kaito puts Yap data for top users on-chain, making "proof of attention" accessible and verifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This allows other builders to integrate this data without needing Kaito's permission, fostering innovation and providing "peace of mind that one day this data is not going to disappear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:45">[02:08:45]</a>. This has led to collaborations where projects use Yap data for whitelisting or discounts based on social reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:19">[02:09:19]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Yu believes the [[The evolution and future of crypto and AI integration | crypto industry]] should move away from copycat products and focus on creating "completely new different products instead of slight improvements" to become a positive-sum game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:20">[02:16:20]</a>.

Kaito's future vision is to redefine the relationship between "attention creators, attention consumers, and attention distributors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:37">[02:25:37]</a> by linking identities and content across various platforms (beyond just crypto, e.g., TikTok, YouTube, GitHub) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>.

The ultimate goal for Kaito AI is to create "a better system and a better network that can distribute information, attention, and capital in a better way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:42">[02:27:42]</a>. Yu's biggest prediction for the next 12 months is that attention will become currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:15">[02:29:15]</a>, with "yapping" evolving from a negative term to a praised activity for founders and community members, decentralizing distribution and making it a level playing field for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:35">[02:30:35]</a>.

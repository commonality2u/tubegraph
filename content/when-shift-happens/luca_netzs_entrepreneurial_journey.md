Luca Netz is a serial entrepreneur who has successfully sold over $500 million in consumer packaged goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He is currently the CEO and owner of Pudgy Penguins, a leading Web3 IP company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Netz started his first business at 18 and became a millionaire at 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Background
Netz's [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]] began from a challenging background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. He grew up in a single-parent household with his mother and brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, experiencing homelessness for about 10 years, moving from couch to couch every six to twelve months in various locations, from the "hood" in New York City and Los Angeles to The Hamptons and Beverly Hills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Despite his mother eventually finding stability, they remained very poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

He dropped out of high school at 16, unable to afford school, believing that going into debt for a degree was not a wise decision for a businessman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. His mother supported his decision to pursue making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Netz tested out of school via the California High School Proficiency Examination (CHSPE) and subsequently got his first job at a tech startup called Ring, while also organizing underground raves and rap shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## First Business: Online Jewelry
At 18, Netz launched his first business selling fake gold chains and cubic zirconia diamonds online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. He chose this niche because hip-hop was the fastest-growing trend in America, and he saw an opportunity for kids to emulate their favorite rappers affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Execution and Marketing
Initially, the business utilized drop shipping through platforms like Amazon and Alibaba, but Netz quickly realized the pain points of long shipping times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. After making his first $100,000, he invested in inventory and began shipping products from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Netz is credited with pioneering influencer marketing in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Unable to afford famous rappers, he approached rapper fan pages on Instagram with large followings, paying $100 for a story or post, which would generate $1,000 in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This strategy was highly effective, leading to rapid growth from $20,000 a month to multi-million dollar months when he was 18-19 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Eventually, he could afford to pay the rappers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### Lessons Learned
Through this venture, Netz realized that business success is "all about marketing and branding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. He believes that even with the best product, if no one knows about it, it won't succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Initially, he focused on cash flow rather than building Enterprise Value or equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. He was making significant money with minimal effort, sometimes $100,000-$200,000 a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This "easy period" lasted about three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. When the easy growth ended, he realized the importance of building a brand, lifetime value, and customer retention, rather than just acquiring new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. He admits that being comfortable leads to complacency, which leads to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Venture Investing & Brand Revival
As cash flow from his initial business decreased, Netz began venture investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. He deployed $5 million of his capital into around 30 different businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

He then took on a role to revive the Von Dutch brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Leveraging his extensive network and experience in influencer marketing, he applied his "Playbook"—a proprietary formula for business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Within 12 months, Von Dutch transformed from a "dead brand" to a $100 million company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. His role was leading the marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, working on a gross revenue deal rather than a salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. He later left Von Dutch due to a contract dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This experience showed him the true power of his playbook when applied to a high-quality brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

Following Von Dutch, he invested in Gel Blaster, which became North America's fastest-growing toy company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This exposed him further to the toy and IP industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

## Crypto and NFTs
Netz's interest in crypto began around 2016-2017, influenced by his tech-savvy brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. He initially mined crypto with 40 AMD 1080 TIs in his mother's apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

His core thesis for investing in crypto was based on the idea that businesses leveraging "basic human rights"—like communication, socialization, or the ability to transact freely without a middleman—have the most upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. He applied this pattern to crypto, believing it was the next such right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

He invested in Litecoin in 2017, bag-holding through the bear market until 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Learning from his earlier mistakes, he now adopts a high-conviction approach, putting "all the chips at the table" when he truly believes in a project, especially during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

His "aha!" moment with NFTs came as a collector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Having grown up poor and never owning nice things, he became a collector of watches, art, and other items, but ran out of physical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. NFTs provided a way to fulfill his collecting need without the chaos of physical collecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

## Pudgy Penguins Acquisition and Vision
His first profile picture (PFP) NFT was a Pudgy Penguin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. He bought and traded over 100 Pudgy Penguins, turning $10,000 into $500,000, which led him into other NFT projects like Bored Apes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

His experience as CMO of Gel Blaster exposed him to the world of toys and IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. Netz saw Pudgy Penguins as perfectly positioned to become a major IP due to its name, art, character, and an incredibly strong and affluent community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. In 2021, he bid 750 ETH (approximately $2.5 million at the time) to acquire the project, which was accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### Leading Pudgy Penguins
Upon acquisition, Netz noted that Pudgy Penguins was started by 18- and 19-year-olds in a college dorm, meaning there was "no business structure, no employee handbook, nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

His approach to running a Web3 business is rooted in collaboration with the community, rather than a dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. He defines a Web3 business as one built "with the hive mind that is your community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. His role is to extract feedback from the community and curate a vision that best serves their collective wants and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

His first action was a one-week sprint to gather the community's vision for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. He then spent several months establishing the business structure, building trust with the community, and executing on their shared vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Within six to seven months, the community recognized his commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

Netz's ultimate goal for Pudgy Penguins is for it to become the number one NFT project globally, the face of crypto, blockchain, and Web3, and one of the world's most beloved characters and IP brands, including extensive physical content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. Their social media presence generates 50-60 million views daily across Instagram, Giphy, TikTok, and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Philosophy
Netz emphasizes that his past pain and suffering taught him the value of a dollar, preventing him from squandering his early wealth on parties or lavish items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He acknowledges being a "people pleaser" but is learning to filter out noise and stay focused on his vision, understanding he "just can't make every single person happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. He believes that eventually, everyone will be happy once the end destination is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. His [[insights_on_the_entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges_in_the_crypto_space | entrepreneurial journey and challenges]] have shaped his philosophy.

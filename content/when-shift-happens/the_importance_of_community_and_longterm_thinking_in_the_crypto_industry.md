Heon Han, co-founder and CEO of Monad Labs, emphasizes that [[building_a_successful_crypto_community_and_marketing_strategy | community building]] and a [[longterm_strategies_and_philosophies_in_crypto_startups | long-term perspective]] are crucial for success in the crypto industry.

## The Pivotal Role of Community

In the crypto space, the only effective path to successful marketing is through [[building_a_successful_crypto_community_and_marketing_strategy | community building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The crypto community is unique because people often care about projects even before they are perfect or fully developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, unlike in traditional tech where new product announcements might receive minimal engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

### Monad's Community Strategy
Monad's success, including raising a significant amount of capital, is attributed in large part to its exceptionally strong community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. The community is described as creative, fun, and makes Monad an enjoyable place to engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. The Monad team embraces the spirit of "crypto Twitter," not taking themselves too seriously and leaning into community-driven lore, art, and memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. This approach allowed community members to organically spread the message far beyond what the core team could achieve alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

### Building a Community
Han advises that it is "never too early" to start [[the_role_of_community_in_crypto_businesses | building a community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. Monad, for instance, launched its Discord in November 2022, right before the FTX collapse. Interestingly, the bear market may have actually helped, as it attracted individuals truly dedicated to crypto who sought a place to connect with like-minded people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.

While an engineer's instinct might be to build the product completely before marketing, an entrepreneurial mindset suggests creating momentum first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. In crypto, this means treating [[the_role_of_community_in_crypto_businesses | community as the product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, especially when the main product (e.g., blockchain) is still far from launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. The goal is to make the community addictive and enjoyable for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>, rather than outsourcing community management to third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>.

The crypto industry is often opportunistic, with many people driven by financial motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. However, a strong community can transcend this, with members forming genuine friendships and sharing experiences and "lore," leading to a deeper connection than just seeking financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. This creates an environment where people stick around for the fun and camaraderie, making the community infectious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

## The Need for Long-Term Thinking

Han observes a prevalent short-term focus in the crypto industry, possibly due to the perception of being in a bull market that won't last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. However, he advocates for a [[longterm_strategies_and_philosophies_in_crypto_startups | longer-term thinking and planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

Starting a company is a significant commitment, often lasting 10 years or more in traditional tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. In crypto, this translates to building something designed to last "multiple cycles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>. The problem isn't needing to pivot to a "hot narrative" to survive, but rather picking the *wrong original idea* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. A "right idea" should be able to attract funding regardless of market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.

Founders must resist pressure from short-term profit-driven investors who might dictate the project's pace and push for fast token launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. Instead, their role is to "do the right thing for the project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. As the industry matures, Han believes there will be a greater appreciation for investors and founders who prioritize long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>.

### Humility and Consistency
Two key values highlighted are humility and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>. Han notes that founders who exhibit hubris in the past have often faced significant downfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>. The crypto community is discerning and quick to judge, meaning any grand claims must be backed by substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. [[Resilience in business and its importance in the crypto market | Consistency]] means remaining grounded, appreciating the privileged position of building in this space, and continuously chipping away at the goal every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. Even if initial progress isn't an "instant massive success," knowing you're heading in the right direction and being positive about incremental progress is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

## Predictions for the Future

Han predicts that within the next 12 months, more projects will acknowledge the critical [[the_role_of_community_in_crypto_businesses | importance of community]] and actively incorporate it into their strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. Many currently understand its importance but fail to prioritize it sufficiently in terms of action, hiring, or founder time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. He also foresees a greater focus on [[longterm_strategies_and_philosophies_in_crypto_startups | longer-term thinking]] within the industry, pushing back against the short-term mentality often driven by market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.

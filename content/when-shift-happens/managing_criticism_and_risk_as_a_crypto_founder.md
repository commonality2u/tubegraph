Guy Young, founder of Athena, a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, shares insights into the [[challenges_and_strategies_in_launching_and_scaling_a_crypto_startup | challenges]] and strategies involved in building and leading a controversial project in the crypto space, emphasizing resilience, practicality, and transparency in the face of criticism and inherent risks.

## Building Anti-Cyclically and Embracing Contrarian Ideas
Young believes that successful builders in crypto operate anti-cyclically to the market, initiating projects during periods of "peak pessimism" when the market is at its lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:10">[02:39:10]</a>. This approach allows for sustained development without the distractions of a bull market, leading to what may appear as "overnight success" later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>.

Launching Athena, a stablecoin-like product that interacts with centralized exchanges, was considered an "outrageous idea" due to the recent failures of Luna and FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:07">[03:05:07]</a>. Venture capitalists and the crypto community initially perceived it as a "divisive product," with some viewing it as the "next ponzi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:07">[03:44:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:33">[03:54:33]</a>. Despite this, Young sees such contrarian ideas as the nature of a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Practicality Over Maximalist Ideals
Young advocates for a pragmatic approach, prioritizing scalability and product-market fit over strict decentralization at the application layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. He argues that while base layers like Bitcoin and Ethereum require decentralization, applications often resemble traditional FinTech businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. He believes that chasing decentralization too early at the application level can be "unhelpful" and that product-market fit should be established first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. This pragmatic stance is shared by other "OG Builders" in the space, who are shifting towards building products that users actually want, rather than solely adhering to purist ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Essential Qualities for Founders: Grit and Controlled Ego
Young identifies grit and perseverance as the most critical skills for success in crypto, more so than raw intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. He observes that "the second smartest guy in the room" often performs best because they possess a "chip on their shoulder" that drives continuous improvement and hard work, unlike those who might become "lazy and comfortable" due to early success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

He also suggests that a degree of "arrogance" is necessary for founders to challenge existing paradigms and build something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. However, there's a fine line, as excessive ego can lead to destructive outcomes, as seen in past crypto failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

## [[Navigating FUD and criticism in the crypto space | Handling FUD and Criticism]]
Young actively seeks out and listens to criticism, even from those who are strongly negative, believing it's crucial to identify and address potential flaws early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:04:00">[43:04:00]</a>. He views dismissing valid concerns as a major mistake made by some founders in the past cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:54:00">[42:54:00]</a>.

Despite initial shock when transitioning from a small group of fans to a large public audience where many were critical, Young has learned to discern valid feedback and respond reasonably, while blocking out unfair attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:04:00">[44:04:00]</a>. He recognizes that launching a controversial product means not everyone will agree with it, which is "part of entrepreneurship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and risks in the crypto ecosystem | Risks in Building Financial Applications]]
Young stresses the "immense amount of responsibility" founders bear when building financial applications, as they involve "real people's money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:20:00">[47:20:00]</a>. He differentiates between honest experimentation that may fail and fraudulent behavior involving lies about usage or underlying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:51:00">[47:51:00]</a>.

For Athena, the primary risk mirrors that seen with USDC during the SVB crisis: the loss of underlying crypto assets held with custodians due to fraud or other issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>. While other risks might cause de-pegs to 98 or 99 cents, the complete wipeout of collateral backing comes from fundamental asset loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:00">[33:10:00]</a>. He acknowledges that while centralization has custodial risks, decentralized finance also faces significant risks like smart contract hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>.

## Leveraging Attention and Ethical Token Launches
Young views attention as the "only scarce resource" in crypto because market valuations and trading are often driven by "mind share" rather than fundamental analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:53:00">[48:53:00]</a>. Athena's controversial nature inherently generated discussion and "did your marketing for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:00">[49:31:00]</a>.

Regarding token launches, Young emphasizes transparency and avoiding prolonged "points farming" schemes that leave users uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:43:00">[50:43:00]</a>. He believes that projects often drag out these incentives due to a lack of confidence in their product-market fit, fearing users will leave once the token is dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>. Athena aimed to be clear about timelines and quickly assess product-market fit, rewarding early supporters generously to build a loyal community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">[51:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>.

## Navigating Market Dynamics and Future Strategy
Young anticipates that interest rates coming down in the US will provide a "nice kick" for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:03:00">[59:03:00]</a>. The launch of an Ethereum ETF will be a significant event for Athena, as it directly benefits from the speculative "long crypto" leverage it creates on centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:14:00">[59:14:00]</a>.

For future [[investment_strategies_and_managing_risk_in_crypto | bear markets]], Athena plans to remain flexible and open to alternative strategies like holding real-world assets (RWAs) to generate returns, acknowledging that the product's performance is responsive to market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. This decision would ultimately be made by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.

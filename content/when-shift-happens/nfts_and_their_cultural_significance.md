Sebastian Borget, co-founder and CEO of The Sandbox, emphasizes that [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]] are "far from dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. He likens claiming [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]] are dead to saying culture is dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While cryptocurrencies are a store of value, [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]] serve as a "store of culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. There continues to be a large volume of [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]] being traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, and ongoing education for developers and creators is crucial to best utilize [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]] for user attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Digital Identity and the Metaverse
The concept of digital identity is considered essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. In the metaverse, individuals can choose their identity, whether male, female, non-human, or non-gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. Digital assets, like [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]], help define which communities one is affiliated with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Studies indicate that over 54% of people with avatars on platforms like Roblox, Fortnite, or The Sandbox feel more like themselves in the virtual world than in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that digital spaces offer a chance to escape societal pressures and judgment based on appearance, allowing individuals to build a new online reputation based on their actions and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. This digital identity can continuously evolve and does not age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

On-chain reputation, based on actions and contributions recorded on the blockchain, is also a significant aspect of digital identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. This transparency allows for the valuation of previously untracked efforts, such as time spent playing games, which could become valuable skills for future digital economy jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

## Building Valuable NFT Communities
There isn't just one method to create a valuable [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFT]] community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. The success of [[challenges_of_nft_collections | NFT collections]] like Pudgy Penguins demonstrates the importance of community spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. Pudgy Penguins is known for its friendly, inclusive, and balanced community, which has successfully bridged to Web2 by launching physical toys sold at Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.

> "Saying [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFT]] is dead is like saying culture is dead." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>

## The Role of Utility vs. Speculation
Sebastian Borget believes that a great [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFT]] project needs utility and a solid team to deliver on its promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. While some argue that [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]] with "no promise" like CryptoPunks hold value due to their historical significance and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>, Borget emphasizes that constant delivery of updates and visible utility (e.g., in The Sandbox with avatars, land, and user-generated content) helps onboard new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. He also highlights that focusing solely on high floor price as a metric for success might limit accessibility and broader adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>. Instead, the number of unique holders of an [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFT]] and its growth is a better metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

## Evolution of NFT Business Models
The traditional model of [[nfts_and_their_pricing_in_ethereum | NFT]] distribution, where items are bought at a certain price and then increase, is shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. A newer model involves free airdrops to many participants, allowing the market to determine the floor price later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>. This approach can help dissociate the value of the [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFT]] from cryptocurrency market fluctuations and attract new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

[[the_potential_and_challenges_of_tokens_and_nfts_in_economics | NFT]] projects launching their own tokens, like ApeCoin for Bored Ape Yacht Club, serve multiple purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. Tokens can reward [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFT]] holders for active participation, offer more liquidity, be staked, exchanged, and enable more granular economies around the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. This allows for distributed rewards, loyalty building, and engagement, akin to a physical currency enabling an economy of services and activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>.

Airdropping tokens to top [[challenges_of_nft_collections | NFT collections]] (e.g., Mad Lads, Pudgy Penguins) is also a new user acquisition model, distributing value directly to users instead of traditional advertising platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

## [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]] and the Creator Economy
The Sandbox's evolution highlights the impact of [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]] on the creator economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. In traditional Web2 mobile gaming, developers struggled to share revenue with creators due to platform limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Blockchain, with its ability to allow ownership and monetization of digital assets, provided a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This new model, particularly with [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]], enables value distribution among players, developers, and platforms in a fairer way, moving away from solely monetizing a small percentage of users and instead involving the community as stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

The Sandbox empowers creators by providing tools like the 3D editor VoxEdit, a marketplace for minting and selling assets on Polygon, and a no-code game maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This fosters user-generated content and allows for a royalty model where a small fee is taken on every transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## The Future of [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFTs]] and Digital Ownership
Borget believes that true digital ownership is essential and that future generations will question why digital content wasn't owned in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. The creator economy will continue to grow, with user-generated content becoming integral to gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. The blending of physical and digital worlds is important, and there is a need for global recognition of digital creators and their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

[[cryptocurrencies_and_nfts_in_gaming | Blockchain gaming]] is seen as the main driver of adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>. Emerging trends like Ordinals and [[impact_of_memes_on_cryptocurrency_and_culture | meme coins]] are considered exciting experiments that could drive further adoption, similar to how pop culture emerged from the streets to become mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. Some speculate that [[meme_coins_and_social_media_influence | meme coins]] could be what social tokens were meant to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. Borget's own social token, SEB, which is distributed for free to The Sandbox [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | NFT]] holders without utility promises, explores how such digital currencies can foster human interaction and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. He envisions a future where any creator in the metaverse could launch their own social token to engage and reward their community of players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

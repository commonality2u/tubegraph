Daryl V, co-founder of Tangent and a prominent crypto trader in Asia Pacific, shares insights into navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market, emphasizing prudent [[investment_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | investment strategies]] and managing [[risks_of_crypto_investment | risk]]. Tangent is a prop trading firm that invests in crypto, across both venture and liquid markets in the Web3 universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

## Daryl's Journey into Crypto

Daryl's transition into crypto was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Formerly an investment banker at JP Morgan, he sought a way to compound his net worth exponentially, which led him to discover crypto shortly after the March 2020 crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. He realized [[investing_in_crypto_without_relying_on_luck | investing]] was the only path to exponential growth, and he sought the most volatile asset class, stumbling upon crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

He started with Bitcoin, then Ethereum, and initially considered Cardano, which he later realized was an "Ethereum killer" narrative, before diving into "shitcoins" during DeFi Summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. His early experiences involved being "exit liquidity" for others, which served as his "trial by fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. He soon found his calling in trading and joined Defiance as an analyst in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations and Market Realities

Daryl emphasizes three core principles for a successful crypto career: "don't cheat, don't lie, and don't hurt someone specifically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. He notes that the crypto space lacks the clear black-and-white legal frameworks of traditional finance, operating largely in "gray areas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. For example, a tweet moving market prices might be illegal in equities but is "fair game" in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

Most of crypto is a "zero-sum game"; when you make money, someone else is losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. People often overestimate others' gains due to online bragging and echo chambers, leading to poor decisions driven by greed and FOMO (fear of missing out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## Investment Strategies and Risk Management

### Conviction and Bet Sizing
One of the most important lessons Daryl learned at Defiance was to match conviction with bet sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. He cites the Sushi trade in December 2020, where he pushed his position from 8% to 50% of his portfolio based on strong conviction and Arthur's bullish sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This trade, from $1.50 to $15, was how he made his first million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Diversification vs. Concentration
Daryl is "never a fan of diversification" because he believes it "kills performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Tangent aims to have its top five largest positions represent at least 75% of their total bet sizes, as it's difficult to keep track of too many positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### Position Sizing for Different Capital Levels
For smaller portfolios ($20,000 to $100,000), Daryl advises slamming one-third to 50% of the portfolio into a high-conviction asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. However, he sets a hard cap of 50% for any single position to mitigate the pain of being wrong or facing exploits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. For larger funds, liquidity constraints often prevent such high concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. An example of a concentrated bet is an "ecosystem bet" like putting 50% into various Base ecosystem coins to express a bullish view on Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### Current Portfolio and Intra-Cycle Rotations
Daryl's biggest position is currently Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He views Bitcoin and Solana as the two primary "beta bets" that he rotates between throughout the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Bitcoin is chosen when he's more conservative, acting almost as "cash-ish" for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, given consistent ETF flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Solana is favored when expressing a strong view that alts will outperform Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Overcoming the "Already Pumped" Mindset
Daryl admits to initially missing Solana's first pump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He explains that his firm initially wrote off Solana when it was at $9 because fundamentals (users, dollars, founders leaving) indicated it was a "ghost chain" and an "FTX SPF scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. The mistake was assuming "fundamentals would lead price" when in crypto, "price leads fundamentals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

When Solana broke $25, sentiment began to turn, with founders retracting their plans to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. At $60-65, they recognized Solana's survival "Against All Odds" and its superior user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, building a long-term position up to $120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

Doubling down on the "first mover" (e.g., Solana) in a full bull market often outperforms chasing smaller caps, providing better [[the_risks_and_strategies_for_capturing_crypto_market_gains | risk-adjusted returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This strategy, however, is specific to "full bull market regimes" and doesn't apply to choppy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Identifying Market Regime Shifts
Daryl uses specific unexpected events as signals for market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>:
1.  **Solana breaking $40 in October 2023**: This showed a return of "proper risk-on sentiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, prompting him to put the "whole book long all alt coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Pepe breaking its one-year range in 2024**: Despite initially shorting Pepe, its rapid surge from $2 to $10 (after a 30% daily move) indicated a "different paradigm change" and full bull market mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### Meme Coins and Market Narratives
Daryl's "honest take" on meme coins is that they reflect the "financial nihilism" of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. They are "valueless tokens backed by memes and vibes" with "absolute brutal honesty" about not being the future of anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. While they get people thinking about speculation, their prevalence could lead crypto to be primarily a "decentralized casino" if no "net new experiences" emerge soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

Meme coins can be the best "beta play" for each chain, but their "beta changes every other week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Daryl advises against chasing narratives unless you spend at least 30 hours a week looking at crypto, as casual investors will "get eaten alive" by full-time traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. For most people, a simple "buy and hold" strategy for high-conviction assets like Solana or Bitcoin is safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. While meme coins can be exciting to trade, they come with "90-95% drawdowns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

### Exiting Positions and Capital Preservation
Positions should be cut when the original thesis is invalidated or when discretionary price points (e.g., a 20-25% loss for volatile assets like meme coins) are hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. It's an art to combine "fundamental invalidation" and "price-based invalidation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. For meme coins, without a thesis, only price dictates the cut, which often leads to "selling the bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

Daryl stresses the importance of protecting capital on the downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Drawing down only 30-50% from a cycle's high, instead of 90-95%, puts an investor in a significantly better position for the next cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. He cautions against trying to sell the absolute top, advocating for a probabilistic approach with hard rules (e.g., "if Bitcoin drops below 55k, I sell everything, I go to cash") to define maximum loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Market Cycle Outlook

Daryl believes the market is "not close to a cycle top yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, expecting Bitcoin to "minimally... breach 100,000" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. He tracks retail flow (Coinbase app rankings) and institutional flow (ETFs), with the latter being a "real game changer" that could "lengthen the cycle a lot longer" and "increase the velocity of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. BlackRock's support of crypto as an asset class means "the rest of TradFi has to follow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, potentially driving Bitcoin to $200-300k this cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

However, he still expects 70-80% drawdowns on Bitcoin in future cycles, as human irrationality and herd mentality will persist, albeit with "far far higher" numbers at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. He looks for signals on the downswing, such as Bitcoin making a lower high and then selling off significantly (e.g., from 70k to 50k after a leverage reset) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Such movements indicate a "very long extended range of chop," where easy money is not made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## The Power of Teamwork and Community

Crypto can be a lonely journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Daryl emphasizes the importance of a team or a group of friends to cover all bases, share alpha, bounce ideas, and check biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This prevents compounding bad decisions, often stemming from being "on tilt" or emotional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

For those looking to join top crypto teams, Daryl looks for:
1.  **Ethical and Cultural Fit**: Upholding high ethical standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
2.  **Hunger**: Eagerness to learn, malleability, and a "killer instinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
3.  **Sharpness**: Quality of ideas, multiple angles, probabilistic thinking (which he believes can be taught) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Daryl's Favorite Projects and Narratives

*   **Pudgy Penguins**: Daryl is a holder and early "appreciator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. He likes the "culture" and "vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. He sees them as a "levered ETH bet" and believes they could reach 50 ETH, though he anchors their value to luxury goods in dollars, suggesting a ceiling when they become more expensive than a Ferrari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Ronin Ecosystem**: Viewed as the "clearest bet" for Web3 gaming, being the third most used blockchain globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Ronin serves as an "aircraft carrier" for gaming bets, allowing rotation into specific games and then back into Ronin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Prime (TCG)**: Particularly interested in its "Colony" game, which combines AI and gaming, where players are "God" and give instructions to an AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Daryl believes it has "no valuation ceiling" if this "AI gaming" narrative takes off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **RWA (Real World Assets)**: Daryl admits to initially missing out on RWA, specifically Ondo, due to a "mid-curve take" on their valuation being tied to yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Ondo's success is driven by its "one condo meme" and association with BlackRock, allowing it to "dream far bigger than what the fundamentals suggest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

Daryl advises betting on narratives that "don't have a ceiling," where people can "dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. These currently include meme coins, AI, and gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Advice for Crypto Newcomers

*   **Mental Preparation**: Be "mentally prepared for insane levels of volatility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Crypto is unlike any other career or profession in its stress levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Fixed Financial Goals**: Don't enter crypto with specific targets like "I'm going to make $2 million by the end of the year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This leads to desperation and taking on risky bets later in the cycle, which is how people "lose everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **"Dance while the music plays, but don't be fixated on any one number"**: When the music stops, "just let it go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

Daryl predicts a "very very heavy cycle in 12 months," including a brutal correction after Bitcoin breaks $100k, similar to the 2021 market structure where Bitcoin went from $64k to $30k and back to $69k <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. He emphasizes that such cycles are "extremely treacherous to navigate," and drawing down only 30% from highs is a "job well done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

Anthony "Pomp" Pompliano, CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of the Pomp Podcast, discusses his approach to [[worklife_balance_and_risktaking_in_entrepreneurship | balancing high ambitions with personal life]], emphasizing the integration of work and family, the importance of intentionality, and how significant life events shape one's perspective on success and time.

## Early Life Philosophy: Squeezing Life
Pompliano's drive to "squeeze as much out of this life as we can" stems from a profound experience during his deployment in Iraq in 2009. After a fellow U.S. soldier was killed, Pompliano, then 20 years old, realized that "today wasn't my day. It was his day, but one day it will be my day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This moment taught him about mortality at a young age, leading him to appreciate life and strive to make the most of his finite energy, time, and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. He believes this is a "very fortunate opportunity in an unfortunate situation to learn mortality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>.

He notes that from a young age, he wasn't chasing money but rather "some degree of freedom" and the ability to act unilaterally, seeking to be "in control of what I wanted to do with my time, my effort, etc." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

## Integrating Work and Family Life
Pompliano actively seeks to [[balancing_personal_and_professional_life_as_a_founder | integrate his professional and personal life]], rather than keeping them separate. He doesn't believe in having "two separate lives like a professional life and a personal life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

### The "I Enjoy Doing It" Mindset
He attributes his ability to [[the_pursuit_of_success_and_its_impact_on_happiness | maintain high levels of engagement]] to genuinely enjoying his work. When asked what he was doing on a Saturday morning, he states, "I was at the office" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>, clarifying that this isn't about bragging about working hard, but rather that he "genuinely look forward to whatever day, time, whatever, because I know that nobody else is going to bother me so I can actually get work done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

He recalled a conversation with his wife who was frustrated by his continuous work, to which he responded, "You see me doing this, you think that it's like so sad that I have to do this. I enjoy doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. He emphasizes the shift from "I have to do this stuff" to "I get to do this stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.

### Family in the Workplace
One unique way he integrates family life is by bringing his young children (under five years old) to the office on Saturdays. This allows for "quality time together where a mom is free to do things and get a break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. While at the office, the kids watch cartoons, draw, and engage in arts and crafts, making it a "special time" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. His wife and brother also work from the same office, fostering an environment where his children are often around the people he works with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.

### Intentional Time Management
Despite his intense work ethic, Pompliano is very intentional about his schedule to ensure he spends time with his family. He works a lot, but is "very intentional about I leave the office by a certain time every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. His goal is to "see my kids when they wake up and I want to see them before they go to sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>, a choice that sometimes means doing calls before going to the office instead of working late. He sees this as a trade-off that allows him to see his kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

He advises people to "figure out how to design your life" by understanding what is important to them and their family, including non-negotiables for their wife and kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This might involve working fewer hours during the week and adding hours on the weekend if you enjoy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

## Regrets and Lessons from Time
Pompliano admits that his biggest mistake in life is "probably time based" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>, specifically having "wasted a lot of time when I was younger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>. While those experiences indirectly shaped him, he expresses admiration for young people who know what they want and pursue it with a "high degree of intentionality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. He views time as "the most expensive asset you have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.

He acknowledges personal regrets about not spending enough time with family, particularly his parents, who live in Switzerland. He realized that "who gives a shit like if I make a bit more money here or there like these are my parents like this doesn't make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. He now makes a conscious effort to call his parents and siblings daily or more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. This reflects a broader lesson in [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | financial and personal growth, overcoming challenges and learning from mistakes]].

## Impact of Fatherhood
Becoming a dad significantly changed Pompliano's perspective, especially regarding long-term thinking. Most of his decisions are now focused on "what is the outcome for them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. He views all his investment money as belonging to his children, which makes him "much more responsible" and "much more long-term thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>. This shift emphasizes resilience, compounding, and a higher confidence level in decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.

His goal is to "build something where I then can have my kids eventually take over and run that thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>, recognizing that building valuable, resilient, long-term oriented ventures takes more than one lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>.

## Defining an Extraordinary Life
For Pompliano, an "extraordinary life" is "whatever you want it to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>, as everyone's definition is different. He believes that happiness is tied to aligning expectations with reality, stating, "the gap between expectations and reality is where unhappiness is measured" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.

He measures happiness by two core questions: "Are they hurting anyone else and are they happy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. If what a person is doing makes them happy and doesn't harm others, he supports it. He believes that "what makes you happy" is what makes life extraordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

He also stresses the importance of continuous learning and being a problem solver. He believes that by helping others become successful and solving their problems, "somehow value will accrue back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>. This mindset, focused on giving rather than extracting, leads to abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:19">[01:47:19]</a>.

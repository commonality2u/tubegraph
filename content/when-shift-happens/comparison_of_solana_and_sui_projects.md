From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

The speaker has significantly shifted their capital allocation, becoming "massively overweight" in SUI compared to [[solanas_potential_as_a_global_computing_platform | Solana]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This allocation stands at over 70% in SUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This decision is based on market observations and fundamentals, not affiliation with the SUI foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Favoring SUI Over Solana

The primary reason for this shift is that the SUI versus [[solanas_potential_as_a_global_computing_platform | Solana]] chart broke out, indicating SUI's strong outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Previously, [[solanas_potential_as_a_global_computing_platform | Solana]] was considered "the strongest horse in the race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>. However, when another large token outperforms [[solanas_potential_as_a_global_computing_platform | Solana]] on weekly or daily charts over significant time horizons, coupled with positive chart patterns and evident adoption, a reallocation is warranted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

Other factors contributing to SUI's appeal include:
*   **Scale and Problem-Solving:** SUI's team is described as very smart, understanding scale and how to solve difficult problems, citing "Wal Russ stuff like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Market Narrative:** The market is beginning to pick up on this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Hallmarks:** SUI exhibits all the hallmarks of a massively growing [[analysis_and_potential_of_the_sui_ecosystem | ecosystem]], with increasing users and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Free Float and Demand:** SUI has a lower free float and high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Developer Activity:** There is significant developer activity within the [[analysis_and_potential_of_the_sui_ecosystem | SUI ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   **Deepbook:** Deepbook, the liquidity layer of [[sui_network_and_blockchain_innovation | Sui Network]], is also performing well against SUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Deep Dive into the [[analysis_and_potential_of_the_sui_ecosystem | SUI Ecosystem]]

The speaker expresses being "hyper bullish on Sui" due to several key aspects of its [[analysis_and_potential_of_the_sui_ecosystem | ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>:

*   **Recognition and Association:** In the Middle East, [[sui_network_and_blockchain_innovation | Sui Network]] is known because of its association with Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Quality of Team:** The quality of people involved is exceptional, with many being ex-Facebook and Google employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This includes individuals like Adony, Evan, Sam, and Christian (head of the foundation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Energetic Atmosphere:** A visit to the SUI office revealed an "insane" energy and atmosphere, reminiscent of Facebook's environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Billion-User Mindset:** The foundation's head, Christian, prioritizes projects that can demonstrate a "path off to a billion users," reflecting SUI's design for massive scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. This forward-thinking mindset is backed by the projects they launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Technological Prowess:** The team's intelligence and ability to solve complex problems, such as "Wal Russ stuff," are highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   **Early Stage with Potential:** While still in an early stage, SUI possesses the hallmarks of a rapidly expanding [[analysis_and_potential_of_the_sui_ecosystem | ecosystem]], with a growing number of users and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. The expectation is for a significant breakout application to emerge this cycle, which will further drive the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Solana's Resilience and Lessons for SUI

[[solanas_potential_as_a_global_computing_platform | Solana]] demonstrated strong resilience in the last cycle, particularly in how its team managed a bare market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Tully (from [[solanas_potential_as_a_global_computing_platform | Solana]]) is credited with doing a "magnificent job" under extreme pressure, earning his stripes and highlighting the importance of managing cash, investing, and building during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

SUI is expected to face its own bare market, where its low free float means it could experience significant downturns just as it experiences large upswings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. The key will be how the [[sui_network_and_blockchain_innovation | Sui Network]] team manages this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Investment Strategy
> The speaker maintains a long-term "buy and hold" strategy for SUI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. While some "lifestyle chips" will be taken off for personal capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, the general approach is to shift asset allocation (potentially towards Bitcoin) rather than exiting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. The speaker cautions against expecting deep corrections (e.g., 70%) in future cycles, as liquidity shifts might lead to shallower drawdowns (e.g., 40%), catching many offside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

Bitcoin, often recognized as digital gold, is increasingly seen as the foundation for a new financial system, moving beyond mere holding to become a programmable asset capable of generating yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. While Bitcoin has historically been a strong performer in terms of capital gains, there is growing demand, particularly from institutions, to [[Yield in crypto vs capital gains | outperform Bitcoin]] by generating yield on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

## Why Seek Bitcoin Yield?

Just holding Bitcoin is no longer considered enough for many institutional investors, who are increasingly benchmarked against Bitcoin's performance and need to outperform it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. For individuals, allocating a portion of their Bitcoin to [[crypto_investment_strategies | DeFi farming portfolios]] can allow them to earn substantial yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

The long-term security model of Bitcoin also necessitates increased utility. Without sufficient transaction fees to incentivize miners, the security model could eventually break down after successive halvings, making Bitcoin more susceptible to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Enabling Bitcoin to be used more, including for yield generation, helps sustain miner revenue and thus the network's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Strategies for Earning Bitcoin Yield

There are both traditional and crypto-native methods to earn yield on Bitcoin.

### Traditional Strategies
[[Bitcoin derivatives and crypto trading strategies | Traditional methods]] include trading strategies like delta-neutral strategies, which involve trading options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. However, these strategies carry significant risk due to Bitcoin's volatility; a major price move can lead to options being exercised, potentially resulting in losses on the principal rather than gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

### Crypto-Native DeFi Strategies: Four Sets of Yield
For individual investors, it's possible to earn up to four distinct sets of yield simultaneously on Bitcoin through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>:

1.  **Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)**: Projects like Lombard or Solve allow users to stake their Bitcoin into a protocol like Babylon. These projects then mint a Liquid Staking Token (LST) in return, which represents the staked Bitcoin and can be used for further DeFi activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. Yield from LSTs is typically paid in their native tokens or points, which can then be redeemed for tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. The estimated yield can range from 1% to 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
2.  **Babylon Staking Protocol**: This is the core Bitcoin staking protocol that natively time-locks Bitcoin on the Bitcoin L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. The yield from Babylon is generated by providing Bitcoin's security to other proof-of-stake blockchains, such as SUI, Bob, or TAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. This yield is paid in Babylon's native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.
3.  **L1/L2 Incentives**: Users can choose to mint their LST token on various Layer 1 (L1) or Layer 2 (L2) blockchains. These chains incentivize the minting of LSTs on their platforms to attract more Bitcoin liquidity into their DeFi ecosystems, providing a third source of yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.
4.  **SAT Layer Restaking**: After obtaining the LST token and potentially earning L1/L2 incentives, users can deposit their LSTs into protocols like SAT Layer. SAT Layer provides a fourth source of yield by using the deposited Bitcoin LSTs to secure applications and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

Combined, these methods can potentially offer yields of 5% to 10% on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

### SAT Layer's Role and Use Cases
SAT Layer aims to build an economic layer for Bitcoin, transforming it into the best programmable collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>. It uses staked Bitcoin as pristine collateral for various use cases, primarily focusing on insurance within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

*   **Insurance**: SAT Layer offers insurance to lending protocols or their users, providing coverage against exploits, hacks, or economic attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. The yield for those providing collateral comes from the insurance premiums paid by these protocols or users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>.
*   **Unlocking Under-Collateralized Loans**: This insurance mechanism is a critical step towards enabling under-collateralized loans in crypto, a "holy grail" for building a more full-fledged financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>. By pairing insurance with decentralized ID solutions or on-chain credit scores, it becomes possible to offer such loans, creating new product lines for lending protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
*   **Slashing Insurance**: SAT Layer can also offer slashing insurance, protecting stakers and restakers from losses due to bad behavior or attacks on the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. This provides principal and downside protection, allowing users to sacrifice a portion of their yield for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.

## Risks Associated with Bitcoin Yield Earning
Engaging in Bitcoin yield strategies involves certain risks:

*   **Custody Risk**: When staking Bitcoin with LST projects, users entrust custody of their Bitcoin to these protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.
*   **Slashing**: Staking and restaking protocols incorporate "slashing," a mechanism to punish bad behavior or network attacks by seizing a portion of the staked assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. While necessary for security, it represents a risk to the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Rehypothecation / Leverage**: The concept of restaking, particularly using staked Bitcoin as collateral for additional applications or infrastructure, involves rehypothecation. This introduces leverage and the risk of liquidation or loss of Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

## The Future of Bitcoin DeFi
The growth in Bitcoin DeFi is predicted to be one of the biggest growth areas in crypto over the next 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. This is driven by Bitcoin's increasing adoption by institutions and nation-states, who, being financially savvy, will seek to use their Bitcoin holdings for financial use cases like borrowing or high-value settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

Ethereum proved the viability of DeFi protocols and mechanisms, and now it's time to integrate Bitcoin into this infrastructure to make it the core asset of DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Innovations like Taproot, which enabled pseudo-smart contract capabilities on Bitcoin, and Ordinals, which introduced NFTs and inscriptions, have paved the way for more innovation and programmability on the Bitcoin blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.

Currently, less than 1% (closer to half a percent) of all Bitcoin is utilized in DeFi, compared to 20-30% for Ethereum or Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>. This represents a massive growth opportunity for builders and investors in the Bitcoin DeFi space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. The competitive landscape is also less crowded in Bitcoin DeFi compared to the saturated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, offering a "founder arbitrage" opportunity to apply existing DeFi innovations to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

Ultimately, the vision is for Bitcoin to transition from just digital gold to the base layer of global finance by 2030, underpinning a more accessible and fair financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. This would involve Bitcoin serving as the primary medium of exchange for settling high-value transactions and financial plumbing, while stablecoins might handle day-to-day payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>. The development of Bitcoin-backed stablecoins is also an interesting direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

Hunter Horsley, co-founder and CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, defines Bitwise as the "leading provider of index funds in the crypto space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Bitwise aims to be the "enduring and leading crypto manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>, aspiring to be the firm investors turn to for their [[investment_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | investment strategies and managing risk in crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>.

## Bitwise's Mission and Role

Bitwise considers itself a "good steward" of public blockchains, working to develop their potential and help others participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This stewardship comes from recognizing that public blockchains are a "very big thing" that can "change the world," surpassing the influence of any single company or individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Their mission is rooted in cultivating constructive development and market structure within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## Client-Centric Approach

Bitwise's core values revolve around serving clients. Their mission is for clients to "love us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. They act as a "teaching assistant" to investors, helping them understand the complex world of crypto by starting from the client's current understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. This involves:
*   Providing insights and explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>.
*   Conducting numerous meetings and calls to address specific concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.
*   Publishing custom analyses and reports to help people understand the evolving landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>.
*   Translating between the often serious "Wall Street" financial institutions and the more informal "tech" developer communities within crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

This educational approach is crucial, as Bitwise believes that if investors understand the space, they will see the opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## The Impact of ETFs and Institutional Adoption

The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by the SEC marks a significant turning point for the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This development makes [[impact_of_institutional_investments_and_etfs_in_crypto | investing in crypto without relying on luck]] more accessible to a broader range of investors, especially institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: Prior to ETFs, [[investment_strategies_and_managing_risk_in_crypto | investing in crypto]] was complex, similar to investing in a private company like Open AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. ETFs simplify this, making crypto accessible through traditional brokerage accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.
*   **Institutional Adoption**: Bitcoin ETFs have seen adoption by institutional investors at 10 times the rate of the gold ETF (GLD) in its first two quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. While institutional ownership of crypto currently stands at around 2% compared to 80% in traditional public markets, this indicates massive potential for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>.

## The Role of Banks and Future Outlook

Banks are becoming significant catalysts for crypto adoption. Hunter Horsley predicts that within 12 months, over 50% of US banks and broker-dealers will have approved access to Bitcoin for their wealth managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>. This will bring millions more people into the crypto space who may not feel confident managing taxes or estate planning themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>.

Banks also play a critical role in capital markets, providing prime brokerage, margin, and custody services that institutions rely on for buying, trading, and borrowing against assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>. As regulatory constraints ease, banks are expected to become major facilitators, helping a wider range of investors participate in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. This integration into traditional financial systems is expected to be an "unbelievable Catalyst" for the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:47">[01:23:47]</a>.

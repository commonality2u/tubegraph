Anthony Scaramucci, an American financier, broadcaster, and bestselling author, is the founder and managing partner at Skybridge, a multi-billion dollar global investment firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. His journey into the world of [[bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency_investment_insights | Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment]] began with skepticism and evolved into a strong conviction.

## Initial Skepticism to Deep Dive

Scaramucci admits he was initially a skeptic of Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. In 2012, he even met Hal Finney, who explained Bitcoin to him, but Scaramucci did not understand it at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

A pivotal moment occurred in 2017 when he was at the White House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Two Federal Reserve officials published a white paper and were discussing the digitization of the US dollar over the blockchain, similar to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. As a 53-year-old at the time, this revelation made him realize he needed to "get up to speed on this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. Shortly after, he left the White House, returned to Skybridge, and purchased the URL bitcoin.com, which marked a significant turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.

He started "doing the homework" on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. His book, "The Little Book of Bitcoin," chronicles his odyssey into the asset, similar to others like Stanley Druckenmiller, Ray Dalio, Paul Tudor Jones, and Michael Saylor, who often start as skeptics but become proponents after doing their research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Scaramucci believes that if very smart and intellectually curious individuals spend time learning about Bitcoin, 95% of them will generally become Bitcoin proponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

### Conditions for Institutional Investment

Despite his growing interest, Scaramucci was nervous about buying Bitcoin as an institutional investor with many clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. He identified three key criteria that needed to be met before Skybridge would make a significant purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>:

1.  **Scalability:** Would Bitcoin scale to 100 million wallets? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a> By late 2020, it was approaching 80-85 million wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
2.  **US Regulation:** Could he get comfortable with the future regulatory environment for Bitcoin in the US? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a> The IRS deemed Bitcoin tangible property, which, based on 900 years of legal precedent on property sanctity in the US, made it very hard to take or make illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. This was seen as a precursor to a favorable long-term regulatory environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.
3.  **Storage Solutions:** Where could institutional investors store Bitcoin, especially for large sums? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a> By late 2020, Fidelity, NYDIG, and Coinbase Pro were offering storage solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>.

Once these conditions were met, Skybridge made an initial $100 million purchase of Bitcoin between October and December 2020, in the $16,000-$20,000 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. They continued to make more purchases, even at $69,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Volatility

Scaramucci emphasizes a long-term holding strategy for Bitcoin, viewing it as "digital property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. He holds over 70% of his net worth in Bitcoin, a byproduct of buying and holding the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. He believes if Bitcoin reaches $400,000, it will constitute over 90% of his net worth, and he is "not selling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

He highlights the importance of "sitting in the asset" if one believes it will grow significantly, like from $1.8 trillion to $20 trillion, which might take 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>.

Regarding market volatility and public perception:
*   In late 2021, after Bitcoin's rise, clients called him a genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
*   By the end of 2022, after Bitcoin crashed, he was called an idiot, and some journalists wrote his "financial obituary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.
*   However, those who stayed with him through the downturn "did very well in '23 and '24" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. This highlights the need to be willing to take hits as an entrepreneur who adapts their business to the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

Scaramucci advises against using leverage with Bitcoin, quoting Warren Buffett: "The leverage is like a spear coming out of the steering wheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. He compares it to driving a fast sports car on an icy, mountainous road, where leverage will "hurt you the most" when you need to brake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. He personally did not hold any of his Bitcoin with leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.

He also cautions against letting the press manage one's money, as the press seeks eyeballs and attention through sensational "car crash" or controversial stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. He suggests buying on "really, really bad days" when the world is supposedly coming to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Belief and Technology

Scaramucci believes Bitcoin represents the intersection of belief and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. He sees the creators of Bitcoin as having a belief that they could build an "unhackable, immutable" hard money that would take the keys away from central bankers, whom he likens to "drunk drivers" inflating currency and monetizing debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. The idea is that the network itself becomes the central authority, removing the need to trust a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>. He credits the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto and the fact that the creator's wallet hasn't moved as a "very good sign for the progenitor of Bitcoin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

He praises Saifedean Ammous, author of "The Bitcoin Standard," for his work, stating that if he has a "crisis of faith" about Bitcoin, he goes back to the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. Reading it reaffirms his conviction, making him want to "buy more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

## Bitcoin Maximalism vs. Other Cryptocurrencies

While Scaramucci is a Bitcoin maximalist in terms of understanding its nature as a store of value, he also owns other coins/protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. As a Wall Streeter, he recognizes the need to tokenize assets like the bond and stock markets over the blockchain to create massive cost savings and economic efficiency by bypassing third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>. He believes this tokenization will not happen on Bitcoin, but rather on Layer 1 protocols like Avalanche, Ethereum (though expensive), or Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.

He distinguishes between Bitcoin as digital gold or property and other valuable protocols like Solana, which he compares to valuable technology companies like Microsoft, Apple, or Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. These other protocols are operating software, akin to the evolution of cloud computing, offering greater efficiency despite initial resistance and regulatory hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>.

## US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve

Scaramucci strongly advocates for a United States strategic Bitcoin reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. He argues this would benefit the US, not just Bitcoin, by establishing Bitcoin as a piece of the future operating layer for transactions, a reliable asset that cannot be corrupted or inflated by central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. He believes Bitcoin, as digital property and a store of value akin to gold, should be held in reserve by the US, similar to how gold, oil, medical equipment, and rare earth minerals are currently reserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

He applauds David Sacks for his "prudent gradualism" in pushing for a bipartisan commitment to Bitcoin, likening it to the apolitical consensus around holding gold and oil in reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. He believes it will take time for Bitcoin to achieve this apolitical status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

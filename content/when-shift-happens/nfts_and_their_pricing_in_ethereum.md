The argument for [[nfts_and_their_cultural_significance | NFTs]] outperforming other assets is rooted in their pricing in [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]], rather than in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Impact of [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]]'s Performance on [[nfts_and_their_cultural_significance | NFT]] Value

[[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] has been a challenging asset to hold over the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. In 2023, [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] saw significant declines in both USD terms and even more against [[bitcoin_valuation_and_future_predictions | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This raises questions about the future of [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | JPEGs]], pictures, or art if [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]]'s value were to remain depressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

However, if [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] recovers and finishes a cycle up 2x, 3x, or 5x, and an individual managed to acquire art when [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] was at a low price, they could see a significant multiple on their investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. When people profit, they tend to reinvest in art, which can lead to art outperforming [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This creates a "double kicker" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Recent sales in the [[nfts_and_their_cultural_significance | NFT]] market illustrate this phenomenon. As [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] fell during a recent correction, [[the_evolution_and_value_of_nfts_in_digital_culture | art]] became cheaper in dollar terms, leading to a surge in purchases by dollar buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Fewer people are holding large amounts of [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] currently, shifting the buying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## The Outlook for [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] and its Ecosystem

While some narratives suggest [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] is "cooked" and that Solana might take over the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, a counter-argument posits that [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] has overbuilt capacity for its current needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] Virtual Machine (EVM) is likened to Microsoft in the enterprise sector: once integrated, it's extremely difficult to replace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Banks, for example, continue to use older systems like Cobalt because changing them carries significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] has passed its "Lindy effect," demonstrating its long-term viability and suitability for financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are highly unlikely to build their primary blockchain infrastructure on newer chains like Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Instead, they are more likely to build on [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] or develop their own Layer 2 solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Goldman Sachs has been involved in the space since 2015 and is building on [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] due to the inherent risk aversion in the financial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Furthermore, [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] offers a yield, making it an attractive product for financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## The Evolving Narrative of [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]]

It's anticipated that [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] will gain a new narrative in the current market cycle, potentially leading to it outperforming [[bitcoin_valuation_and_future_predictions | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Looking five years out, [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] is expected to remain incredibly important, assuming no fundamental screw-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Similar to [[bitcoin_valuation_and_future_predictions | Bitcoin]]'s journey from being hated to establishing its narrative as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | ETH]] also needs a clearly defined and enduring narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This narrative is likely to revert to the original idea of [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] as a "world computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> and the primary platform for [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | tokenization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. All major cryptocurrencies go through a period of intense questioning before their core value proposition solidifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Ultimately, [[current_and_future_valuation_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] is expected to prevail as a decentralized compute platform operating at a global scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

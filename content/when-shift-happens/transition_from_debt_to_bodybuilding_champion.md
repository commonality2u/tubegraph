Nicola Jongli, a two-time Europe champion and one-time World champion in bodybuilding, has transformed his life from being a student burdened by significant debt to living what many would call a dream in Bali, managing multiple ventures and enjoying financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. His journey is a testament to the power of [[personal_growth_through_adversity | discipline]], consistency, and an unwavering belief in one's dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>.

## Early Life and Overcoming Debt
At just 19 years old, Nicola found himself in a precarious financial situation. He started his adult life with a substantial debt of $20,000 following a severe car crash in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. His car was uninsured, leaving him personally responsible for the costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. As a student with no stable income, paying back the loan was a constant struggle, and the debt continued to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Nicola describes this period as a "tough moment" where he couldn't pay his bills and was constantly in the negative with his bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. He faced a choice: let the situation "kill" his future or use it as fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. With "big dreams and ambitions," he refused to accept defeat or give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It took him four years to completely clear the debt, a period marked by eating cheap food and significant financial constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Rise of a Bodybuilding Champion
Nicola's fitness journey began at 13 with martial arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. He started going to the gym at 14 as a complement to martial arts, not out of inherent passion for fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. He initially viewed bodybuilding as "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

The pivotal shift occurred when his job as a microtechnic engineer conflicted with his martial arts training. Bruises from sparring were unacceptable at work, forcing him to stop fighting preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Losing the competitive aspect, he lost motivation for martial arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

He then "isolated" himself in the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. As his physique developed aesthetically, friends encouraged him to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. By observing a friend's full competition process, including nutrition, training, and mindset, Nicola realized the intense personal challenge involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. He found it appealing that "you're not fighting with someone else, but you're fighting with yourself every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Nicola's approach to competition is resolute: he only competes to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. He began his bodybuilding journey seriously at 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. His first major breakthrough came when he won the World Championship in Las Vegas in November 2017, an achievement he didn't expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. This victory led to an explosion in media attention, social media following, and sponsorship opportunities, changing his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

His daily routine during this period involved working two full-time jobs: as an engineer and as a competitive bodybuilder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. He woke up at 5 AM for cardio, worked until 5 PM, then trained hard at the gym, and cooked all five meals for the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This demanding schedule left him with "no life" outside of cardio, job, training, cooking, and sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Leveraging Influence and Entrepreneurship
Nicola's [[building_and_scaling_a_successful_business | transition from traditional finance to decentralized finance]] began by simply sharing his journey on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. He documented his workouts, diet, and daily life, including his demanding schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. His goal was to provide value to his audience, whether through motivation, inspiration, or practical tips on nutrition and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

His first sponsorship in 2016, a small deal of $500 a month and free clothes, came when he had around 50,000 followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. He quit his engineering job at 26, only after his income from social media surpassed his main salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the instability of relying solely on social media income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. He lost one deal and three others were frozen, resulting in no income from social media for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>. This experience reinforced the need to diversify income streams and invest outside of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.

Nicola emphasizes that success as an influencer requires a [[building_and_scaling_a_successful_business | business mindset]] to monetize influence effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. Key strategies for growth include:
*   **Authenticity and Reality:** People are tired of "perfect" and "fake" online personas; they seek realness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.
*   **Value Provision:** Giving followers motivation, inspiration, tips, or entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Niche Identification:** Understanding your community and promoting products relevant to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   **Constant Growth:** Influencers are in a "constant race" to grow their audience and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** Building your own products (like his upcoming fitness app) in addition to brand collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Philosophy
Nicola's journey highlights the profound impact of [[personal_growth_through_adversity | adversity on personal growth]]. His parents' separation when he was two years old unconsciously impacted his relationships, leading to toxic attachment issues with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>. Through therapy, he realized his happiness depended on external relationships, leading to anxiety and jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>. He learned to find happiness within himself first, making subsequent relationships healthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.

On [[balancing_high_ambitions_with_mental_health | mental health]], Nicola stresses the importance of disconnecting from the constant demands of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. He deliberately sets aside time, like Sundays, to put his phone in airplane mode and be fully present, which he finds incredibly peaceful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. His commitment to his physical health also contributes to his mental stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

Nicola's life philosophy centers on discipline, consistency, and delayed gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>. He recognizes that motivation fluctuates, but discipline is what drives action even when motivation is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>. He views his demanding work schedule as a choice, not an obligation, which makes it enjoyable and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>. His ultimate goal is to maintain his freedom and build a secure future for his family, ensuring his future children do not face the same struggles he did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>.

## Fitness and Nutrition Philosophy
Nicola stresses that **nutrition is the most important factor** in achieving fitness goals, even more so than training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:51">[01:36:51]</a>. He advises choosing foods you enjoy and being creative with cooking to make healthy eating sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>. For those with full-time jobs, he recommends meal prepping for a few days at a time or investing in meal services if affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>. When traveling, he always finds healthy options, dismissing the excuse of "lazy" people who prefer junk food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:26">[01:31:26]</a>.

Beyond nutrition, key aspects of fitness often overlooked are:
*   **Sleep and Recovery:** Muscles are built during sleep, not in the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a>. Adequate sleep is crucial for muscle recovery and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:14">[01:34:14]</a>.
*   **Mind-Muscle Connection:** Focusing on feeling the muscle contract and stretch during exercises leads to better sensations and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** "Bad genetics" is often an excuse; consistent effort over years, like his 17 years of training, can transform a physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>.
*   **Professional Guidance:** For those lacking knowledge, hiring a nutritionist or coach is essential, just like hiring an architect for a building project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

Nicola's ultimate advice is to **"just be happy"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:56">[01:39:56]</a>. He believes that no matter what you achieve, if you're not happy, it doesn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. His definition of success is the freedom to live life on his own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. He encourages everyone to "make the most of your life" and not waste time on things that don't bring benefit or happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:33">[01:42:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>.

The audience within the cryptocurrency space has undergone significant transformations since its early days, impacting developers and projects alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

## Early Days: Technical and Informed
When Andre Cronje first became involved in [[redefining_crypto_for_wider_adoption | DeFi]], the participants were predominantly highly technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. The early audience understood his processes, including how he deployed his work on-chain due to the lack of tooling available at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. They recognized the composite nature of his applications, which often required on-chain interactions not easily replicated in test environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

## Shift to a Broader, Less Technical Audience
Over time, the crypto audience drastically changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. By the time Cronje stepped back around 2020-2021, the demographic was starkly different:
*   **Non-technical Majority** The audience became approximately 1% technical and 99% non-technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.
*   **Information Sources** Many new participants learned about projects through social media platforms like Reddit or 4chan, often sending their life savings into projects based on this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   **Misconceptions** There was a growing trend where the more "niche famous" a developer became, the less their audience understood about their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

### The Eminence Incident
A significant "wakeup call" was the Eminence incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. Cronje had launched a theoretical framework for gaming NFTs, part of his iterative development process which involved deploying contracts on-chain for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. However, a large, active audience, unaware of his usual methods, mistakenly assumed a deployed contract was a finished product and sent $16 million into it, which was subsequently exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. This highlighted a critical disconnect between the developer's process and the audience's expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

### Solidly and the "Rational Actor" Fallacy
With the Solidly project, Cronje again observed a non-technical audience with significantly higher expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. He had assumed that all participants in the system would be "rational actors" and not engage in actions that would devalue the ecosystem, even though the theoretical possibility was documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>. However, within hours of launch, two individuals spent millions to game the system in a way that ultimately made their investments worthless, proving his assumption false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

The phrase "do your own research" (DYOR) had become a meme, with many users opting to "ape in" (invest heavily without understanding) rather than read documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. This shift meant that developers had to dedicate substantial time to "expectation management," which became an exhausting task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## Developer Adaptation and Outlook
The changing audience necessitated a shift in how projects are launched and managed:
*   **Immutable Primitives vs. Companies** In earlier crypto, the focus was on deploying immutable primitivesâ€”contracts that could not be modified once launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. This approach assumed a technical audience who understood these limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. However, with the new demographic, a more centralized, company-led approach with mechanisms for upgrades and accountability became necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   **Incentive Alignment** Cronje also recognized the need to align incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. His previous approach of giving away 100% of tokens, which disincentivized him from doing ongoing work but also removed upside, proved problematic with an audience that expected continued involvement without understanding the original premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.
*   **User Experience (UX) Focus** For new projects like Sonic, the focus is heavily on improving the UX and UI from the DAP developer's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>. This includes features like:
    *   Fee monetization for dApp developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>.
    *   Fee subsidies to allow users to interact without owning a wallet or gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.
    *   Native account abstraction with economic abstraction, enabling users to access dApps with Google authentication, email, or biometrics instead of traditional wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.

Cronje now designs systems that do not assume rational actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>, having learned that people primarily act in their self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. This hardened perspective, though difficult to internalize, has simplified his approach to development and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.

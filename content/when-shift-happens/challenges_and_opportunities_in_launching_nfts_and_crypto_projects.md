The journey of launching and scaling [[Challenges and strategies in launching and scaling a crypto startup | crypto startups]] and NFT projects is characterized by unique [[Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto | challenges and opportunities]], especially in the rapidly evolving Web3 ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Irene Zhao, a prominent Chinese model and influencer, and founder of So-Called, a Web3 social platform, shares her insights into this dynamic industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Irene Zhao's Entry into Crypto and NFTs

Irene Zhao's transition into the crypto space began in 2021 as a CMO for a DeFi project, leveraging her existing influence and marketing skills from Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Her initial foray into influencing started after university, relatively late compared to others, but quickly gained traction through viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This experience taught her how to attract followers by analyzing content appeal and consistently posting in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Her move to crypto Twitter was a strategic necessity, as it is the primary platform for individuals involved in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. She quickly gained over 100,000 followers within half a year, largely due to the scarcity of women in crypto at the time and her existing influence on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

### The Power of NFTs for Creators and Communities

Irene recognized the potential of NFTs beyond fungible tokens, viewing them as a powerful business model for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. NFTs allow creators to:
*   **Monetize diverse content:** Turn various forms of content, such as videos, dances, or music, into NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.
*   **Establish ownership:** Shift ownership of content from centralized platforms (like Instagram or YouTube) to the creators themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   **Build exclusive communities:** Use NFTs as a gated channel to access exclusive content and inner circles, fostering a special relationship between creators and fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
*   **Share success with early supporters:** Enable early supporters to reap benefits as the creator grows, promoting evangelism and financial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

## Case Study: The Irindale NFT Collection

The Irindale NFT collection, a free mint for fans, was launched as a social experiment and meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. It minted out within 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. Its virality stemmed from its ridiculousness and novelty as the first-ever creator NFT in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>. The project gained significant traction after a key figure, mcnugrats, and later Logan Paul, publicly supported it, driving the floor price to 5 ETH at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This success cemented Irene's branding as a pioneer in creator NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.

This experience led to the founding of So-Called, aiming to simplify the process of launching NFT collections for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. The goal was to consolidate complex steps (smart contract development, OpenSea, Discord, Snapshot) into a single, user-friendly platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

## [[Challenges and risks in the crypto ecosystem | Challenges and Risks in the Crypto Ecosystem]]

### Navigating Social Media Platforms

Twitter requires constant monitoring and a deep understanding of crypto jokes and memes. Unlike Instagram, the crypto community is less tolerant of unauthentic or unfunny content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Irene found it challenging to reconcile her different personas across platforms, as posting lifestyle content on Instagram while discussing crypto on Twitter led to confusion and negative comments from her original audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

### Public Perception and Education Barriers

A significant [[Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto | challenge]] in the crypto and NFT space is the public's perception and lack of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. Many still view NFTs as scams or valueless digital assets, creating a high education barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>. For example, K-pop fans are strongly against their idols associating with NFTs, citing environmental concerns and the poor performance of existing celebrity NFT projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

### Market Volatility and Fundraising

The crypto market is highly volatile, with rapid shifts in narratives and prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. This poses [[Challenges and risks in the crypto industry | challenges and risks]] for fundraising and business operations.
*   **Bear Market Impact:** After major events like the 3 Arrows Capital, Luna, and FTX collapses, investor confidence plummeted, making it significantly harder to raise money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
*   **Burn Rate Management:** During bull markets, rapid expansion (e.g., hosting parties, extensive marketing) might lead to high burn rates. In bear markets, companies must pivot to focus on product development and cost-cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Token Launches:** Launching a token introduces a second business layer, where the token's price often dictates public perception of the project's success, regardless of underlying developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>. Token prices are affected by numerous factors, leading to potential blame from the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.

> "I think it's challenging for all the builders unless you're building infrastructure... but if you are building a d app, it's very specific much harder." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>

### Mental Health and Resilience

The crypto industry is an "emotional roller coaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>. To cope, Irene emphasizes the importance of acceptance, acknowledging current market realities, and being mentally strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. It's crucial to ignore the noise and avoid comparing oneself to others, especially given that many online portrayals of wealth are exaggerated or false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. Focusing on personal growth and comparing oneself only to one's past self helps maintain resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

## Opportunities and Future Outlook

Despite the [[Current challenges and innovations in crypto Venture investing | challenges]], opportunities persist:
*   **B2B Collaborations:** While B2C adoption for NFTs faces hurdles, many large companies remain committed to the NFT business, seeing it as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. These brands often already believe in the technology, making them easier to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
*   **Innovation in Bear Markets:** A bear market provides a less noisy environment, allowing builders to focus on developing innovative and useful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Conviction:** While narratives change rapidly, maintaining a firm conviction in one's core thesis and remaining flexible to adapt around it is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

> "Bear Market is a good time for you to build because there are much less noise." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>

The crypto space, though unpredictable, offers immense potential to bring value to millions of people, making it a compelling area for builders dedicated to mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

Memes are fundamental drivers of narrative, which in turn influences price in the cryptocurrency market. According to JP Thor, an engineer, investor, and founder of Thorchain, "every token is a [[understanding_meme_coins_and_their_place_in_the_financial_ecosystem | meme coin]]; they're just high velocity memes that extract value from a community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Role of Memes in Cryptocurrency

The significance of memes in crypto has been apparent since at least 2017, with coins that successfully attach themselves to [[the_rise_and_influence_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | memes]] demonstrating strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

### Thorchain's Meme-Driven Success
Thorchain, a decentralized exchange and the world's largest liquidity protocol with a market value over $2 billion, was intentionally built on memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. The project extensively leveraged Norse mythology, creating a "self-reinforcing memetic taglines that drove a narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Examples include "3x tvl," "liquidity black hole," and associating Thorchain's CEO with "Marvel Thor" and Chris Hemsworth, which generated numerous shareable gifts and memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

The strategy was to simplify complex memes into "simple taglines you can latch onto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. This approach also involved adopting an "edgy" and "bipolar" brand, aiming to make people "either love it or hate it" to create a cult-like following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

### Every Coin is a Meme Coin
JP Thor asserts that every cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, functions as a [[exploring_meme_coins_and_their_market_dynamics | meme coin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>. Bitcoin's foundational meme is its status as "digital gold," recognized for being "0. on the monetary properties chart," finite, and possessing the longest "Lindy effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

Even established projects like Chainlink cultivated a strong "meme Army" with "Link Marines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

### [[the_rise_and_influence_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | Meme Coins]] and Market Dynamics
This cycle, [[the_impact_of_meme_coins_on_the_crypto_industry | meme coins]] are the "main narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. These are often "high velocity memes that extract value from a community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. Their survival depends on whether the "inflow of people outpace the half life of that coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

## Memes and the Evolution of Humanity

Memes are not just digital phenomena; they are integral to human progress and the transfer of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.

> "Our purpose is to upgrade Humanity both memetically and genetically." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>

Humans possess a "much more way faster way of upgrading memes" due to advanced speech organs and curious brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. This allows for rapid intelligence transfer, where individuals can learn from others without needing to "live and die to upgrade your understanding the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

### The Memetic Repository
Humanity relies on two "giant repositories":
1.  **Genetic Repository:** Teaches fundamental biological functions like walking and breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
2.  **Memetic Repository:** Accumulated knowledge and understanding learned since childhood, essential for navigating the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.

The collective memetic repository is seen in the advancement of science and technology, like the miracle of flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>. Concepts like F=ma and E=mc² are considered "very useful meme[s] with long halflife" that upgraded humanity's understanding of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.

### Building in Public and Setting Memes Free
A core philosophy is to "build in public" and "set the [[the_impact_and_evolution_of_memes_on_the_internet | memes]] free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. Withholding useful information by building in secret is seen as contrary to the purpose of upgrading humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. This means rejecting NDAs, copyright, trademarks, and patents, believing "good ideas flourish about idea ideas do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. Building in public accelerates the spread of ideas and makes founders "far more investable" by demonstrating their ability to navigate adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.

### Threats to the Memetic Repository
The memetic repository is vulnerable to catastrophic events. Solar flares or coronal mass ejections could turn off electrical grids and zero out transistors, taking humanity offline and leading to chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:33">[01:41:33]</a>. The more technologically advanced humanity becomes, the more fragile it is to such disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:08">[01:42:08]</a>. Therefore, there is a critical need to "export our genetic M medic repository as a backed up out of Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:22">[01:43:22]</a>.

### The Future of Memes and Intelligence
The increasing prevalence of bots and AI, capable of generating infinite content, poses a risk of zombifying humanity through "consumption death spiral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. Devices and platforms, if used purely for consumption, can lead to a decline in productivity and agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>.

The solution is to use devices as "output devices" and "leverage devices" for creation rather than consumption, spreading potent memes with long half-lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>. Ultimately, future silicon machines will have even greater precision and computational power to observe the universe and "arrive at memes which are more correct than E=mc² or F=ma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>. Humans' purpose will be to advance intelligence and create new memes, even potentially through technologies like "space brains" where consciousness can be uploaded to extend life and agency beyond biological limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.

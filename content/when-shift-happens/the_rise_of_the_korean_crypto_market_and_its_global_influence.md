The Korean crypto market has emerged as a strategic and highly influential force in the global blockchain landscape. Driven by a passionate community and a unique retail-centric environment, it has become a significant hub for cryptocurrency adoption and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Early Beginnings and Community Building

The initial boom in the Korean crypto market began in 2017, attracting many high-profile founders to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Ryan Kim, Founding Partner at Hash, describes how he and co-founders started in 2016 as individual investors, meeting weekly to study Ethereum and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This grassroots effort led to the formation of a community that evangelized blockchain as the future, encouraging developers, founders, conglomerates, and venture capitalists to invest and build projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This initiative was foundational to the Korean crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Ryan Kim, an engineer and entrepreneur who previously founded and sold a big data company, recognized blockchain's potential as a "heaven for data scientists" due to its open data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. He chose to move into investing due to a desire to learn new ideas from many people and because the blockchain space was still very "naive," with its final form unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Hash's Evolution and Investment Philosophy

Initially, Hash's community activities attracted founders who, satisfied with their engagement, offered allocations in their projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This spontaneously led Hash to become private sale investors and a crypto fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The early success of ICO investments, despite high failure rates (99.9% were scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>), yielded significant returns (100x-200x) from a few successful projects like OmiseGO, KNC, and EOS, enabling them to start their own fund in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Hash focuses on supporting visionary founders for the long term, aiming to see their dreams materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Their investment strategy includes:
*   **User Activity as a Metric**: For Hash, the number of users onboarded and user activity are crucial metrics for success, more so than just FTV or valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.
*   **Market Timing**: Hash believes in consistently investing in founders and projects, regardless of market conditions, but more aggressively in bear markets when valuations are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
*   **Post-Crash Resilience**: Following the 2018 crash, Hash's team remained committed due to their belief in the decentralization thesis, confident that the market would recover within one to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Institutionalization**: Over seven years, Hash has evolved from a community-driven fund to a more institutionalized entity with established systems and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## Korean Retail Market Dominance

The Korean market is distinctive for its rapid adoption of investment trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. It is one of the most important crypto markets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Key statistics include:
*   **Trading Volume**: Korean Won (KRW) crypto pairs, particularly on exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb, generate approximately 3 to 4 billion USD in daily trading volume, which is higher than Coinbase's 1 to 2 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Active Traders**: Around 20% of Korea's total population are active crypto traders, compared to 5-10% in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

## Mass Adoption and Use Cases

Ryan Kim believes that the finance sector (payments, lending, borrowing, DEX) offers obvious use cases for blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. Beyond that, he sees [[impact_of_crypto_gaming_on_adoption_and_economy | gaming]] and [[influence_of_social_media_platforms_on_the_crypto_space | social]] applications as key for mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Stablecoins are considered the most successful use case globally so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

In 2019, during the crypto winter, Hash identified [[impact_of_crypto_gaming_on_adoption_and_economy | gaming]] as the sector that would drive initial mass adoption, akin to early internet services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. They launched Hash Labs, an incubation team, and invested in eight [[impact_of_crypto_gaming_on_adoption_and_economy | gaming]] companies, four of which (Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, Mythical Games, and Node Games) became unicorns. Hash was the first check investor for Axie Infinity and The Sandbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.

Hash remains bullish on the Ronin team, highlighting their well-balanced co-founding team (Trang, Alexander, Gio), their experience with Axie Infinity, and their ability to provide the right infrastructure and user base (700,000 daily active users) for games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.

### Integrating Culture: Anime and K-Pop

Hash is actively working to integrate blockchain with popular cultural phenomena.
*   [[integrating_japanese_anime_and_korean_pop_culture_with_blockchain | Japanese Anime]]: Their portfolio company, Kazil Labs, acquired a Japanese anime studio, Najja Studio, to onboard Japanese IPs onto the blockchain. They believe the strong and sticky fanbase of anime, with its high viewership and merchandising, is ideal for creating dedicated networks like an "anime chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.
*   [[integrating_japanese_anime_and_korean_pop_culture_with_blockchain | K-Pop]]: Hash's own studio, Mood House, has launched K-pop idol groups (TripleS and EMIS) to create a "K-pop chain." The goal is to allow fans to buy NFTs or governance tokens related to K-pop groups or anime IPs, giving them ownership and participation in the creative process, moving beyond mere consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. This model could also enable fans to fund new IPs and receive financial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.

## Global Bridge Strategy

Hash aims to be a bridge between the US and Asian crypto markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>. They have expanded with offices in San Francisco, LA, Singapore, India, and are looking at Japan and the Middle East (UAE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>.
*   **US Market**: Characterized by large capital (Mega VCs like a16z, Paradigm, Pantera) but less retail participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.
*   **Asian Markets**: Dominated by retail investors (e.g., Vietnam, Korea, China, India, Turkey are top five on Binance) but fewer mega VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. Asia brings speculation and liquidity, while the West brings credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>.

Hash connects US founders to Asian retail markets and Asian founders to US funds for credibility and capital, leveraging the complementary strengths of both regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:05">[01:51:05]</a>. They prefer Asian founders who can target both markets, citing examples like Solana's success in Asia and Vitalik Buterin's long-term presence in Shanghai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:49">[01:51:49]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Ryan Kim predicts that the current period is still within a bull market, with growing adoption, even if Google Trends for Bitcoin search index is still half of the last cycle's peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:02">[02:11:02]</a>. He anticipates a "huge bull market" when crypto economy integrates with the real-world economy, with BTC ETFs being a first case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:05">[02:40:05]</a>. He believes that with more institutional money flowing in, Bitcoin's price volatility will decrease compared to previous cycles, while other assets like L1s and L2s might still experience high volatility, presenting opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:46">[02:43:46]</a>.

Ryan stresses the importance of transparency to prevent future collapses like Luna, FTX, or Celsius. While bubbles and collapses are natural in any industry, increased transparency and consistency can reduce their likelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:37">[02:33:37]</a>. He hopes the energy and liquidity from [[the_rise_and_influence_of_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coins]], which he sees as the "final form of speculation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07">[02:22:07]</a>, can be transformed to support more fundamentally sound projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>.

Mass adoption will likely come from integrating wallets into existing platforms like Telegram and Twitter, making it easier for users to spontaneously create wallets and connect to Web3 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:12">[02:10:12]</a>.

The Pomp podcast, hosted by Anthony Pompliano, is a prominent show in the crypto and finance space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Initial Attraction to Crypto

Most people are drawn to the world of [[Bitcoin as an investment and its community | Bitcoin]] and [[investment_opportunities_in_crypto | cryptocurrencies]] primarily because they believe they can make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. While individuals initially seek financial benefit, they often learn about the underlying ethos of the technology over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>. As Marty Bent is quoted saying, "People come for the money... they stay for the money," meaning they initially seek profits but eventually recognize the generational importance of digital sound money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.

The speaker initially dismissed Bitcoin twice in 2012 and 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. His first interaction with the industry was mining Ethereum (Ether) in 2017, largely because GPUs were easier to acquire than ASICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. It was only after the price had significantly risen the third time he heard about it that he became "obsessed" with understanding what he had missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. According to Michael Saylor, dedicating 30 hours to studying [[Bitcoin as an investment and its community | Bitcoin]] typically leads to recognizing its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Approach

### Bitcoin Maximalism and Public Commentary
While often perceived as a "Bitcoin maxi" who built his personal brand around Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>, the speaker clarifies he was never a hardcore maximalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. He made a conscious decision to primarily discuss [[Bitcoin as an investment and its community | Bitcoin]] publicly due to his large audience, feeling uncomfortable talking about other "shitcoins" that could lead people to lose money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. He viewed Bitcoin as the lowest risk asset and the "S&P 500 of crypto," indicating that if Bitcoin rises, other assets tend to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. His long-term orientation guided this public stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. Despite criticism from various crypto factions, his approach allowed him to think independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

### Learning from Mistakes and Market Cycles
Investing in crypto involves risk, and the speaker acknowledges that sometimes things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. He cites the example of BlockFi, a crypto lending company that failed in 2022, which was both a sponsor of his show and a significant personal investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. He lost money in the situation, but emphasizes that he was treated no differently than any other user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>. He believes that accepting accountability for losses when things go wrong is crucial, just as one takes credit for successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

The speaker believes that experiencing failures, such as the 2022 bear market, serves as a humbling and healthy experience for the industry, leading to better-structured companies and more knowledgeable investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. This market downturn was the first time the crypto industry was on a "big stage," attracting mainstream attention and Wall Street interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>.

### Importance of Self-Custody
A critical piece of advice for those serious about their [[crypto_investment_strategies | crypto investing journey]] is to learn how to self-custody assets using cold storage or hardware wallets like Trezor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. The mantra "not your keys, not your coin" highlights the importance of retaining control over one's digital assets to prevent loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.

## Utilizing Leverage in Business and Investment

Leverage is crucial for entrepreneurs because it allows one to "do more with less" when faced with finite energy, time, and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. This concept applies to various aspects of business:
*   **Human Capital Leverage**: Having excellent people manage different businesses allows for broader involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. This creates a reciprocal leverage where both the leader and the team benefit from each other's expertise and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   **Media Leverage**: Podcasting and personal branding are new forms of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. The media industry profits by arbitraging audience attention through various forms like subscriptions, ads, or selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. Podcasts can generate economic value, equity value, or reputational capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

## Identifying Future Trends

When identifying early trends, the speaker uses two primary methods:
1.  **Observing Conversations**: If a topic is never discussed among smart people, it's likely early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.
2.  **Negative Reaction**: If proposing an idea to others elicits a negative reaction, it's often a good sign of an early trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. This indicates it's "close to the target" because it's different and potentially offers outsized returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

Some of the next big trends that are currently early or ridiculed include:
*   **Humanoid Robots**: Potentially the largest total addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.
*   **Energy Market Innovation**: Private companies are developing large-scale solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>.
*   **Space Utilization for Earth Benefits**: For example, manufacturing drugs in zero gravity and bringing them back to Earth, rather than solely focusing on interplanetary travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin and the Crypto Industry**: Still drastically underestimated by people outside the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

Chaofan Wong, a founding partner of Alliance DAO and founding head of product at Messari, shares his insights on navigating the cryptocurrency market, identifying successful projects, and the qualities of great founders. Alliance DAO's mission is to find the best founders in crypto and help them build products that people love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## The Crypto Market: Cycles and Lessons Learned

Wong entered crypto in 2012, initially drawn by the market's volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. A pivotal moment was when his money was stuck in the traditional banking system for half a year while trying to arbitrage between offshore betting platforms, leading him to realize the value proposition of Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. He went "all in" on crypto in 2017, at the peak of the bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

### Learning from Historical Events
Wong emphasizes learning from [[market_trends_and_cryptocurrency_cycles | historical patterns]] in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. He compares the FTX collapse to the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack, noting that in both cases, a small group of passionate developers continued building, providing conviction for the ecosystem's survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This phenomenon also occurred during the Bitcoin Civil War (SegWit drama) in 2017, where the Bitcoin core community's critical mass of believers ensured its survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

> "Crypto networks including Solana, Ethereum, etc., Bitcoin, you can think of them as a living being, and this living being has a critical mass of people involved. As long as you're above this critical mass, then you will survive." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>

### Recognizing Product-Market Fit
For crypto products, growth often follows a "staircase" trajectory rather than smooth exponential growth, with long periods of flatness followed by bursts of activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Examples include Coinbase and Farcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. Wong highlights that many people are "too lazy to try the products," which is a significant "alpha" for investors and entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Experiencing the product directly (e.g., sending a Bitcoin transaction, using DeFi during DeFi Summer, or Solana's speed) provides "magical moments" that signal potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## Investment Philosophies

### Contrarian Thinking
A great investor's natural stance is to question the consensus and be contrarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. This trait is shared by the best founders, who fundamentally "figure out an insight about the market, about the users, that no one really understands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

### Developing Judgment
Judgment, described as knowing the long-term consequences of actions, is developed by taking action and getting "humbled by the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

> "There's two types of investors: those who are humble and those who will be humbled." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>

### Investing vs. Trading
Both long-term investing and short-term trading can be successful depending on an individual's skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Short-term trading is effective with small capital, allowing for quick compounding, while long-term investing suits larger capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Both approaches involve studying historical patterns, but short-term trading provides faster feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

### Evolution of Investment Strategies
Applying traditional investment strategies to crypto, Wong notes that Charlie Munger's [[investment_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | philosophy of investing]] in great companies at fair value (growth investing) is more applicable than pure value investing, especially given the growth-driven nature of the internet era and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. In crypto, this means looking for protocols or tokens that demonstrate growth through on-chain transactions, Total Value Locked (TVL), or narrative attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

> "People bet their money where their attention is going and where their kind of excitement is going about the [[future_prospects_and_trends_in_the_crypto_market | future]] and not necessarily about the present and how well things are doing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>

## Understanding Market Dynamics

### Challenges of Outperforming Major Cryptocurrencies
Wong maintains a core portfolio primarily in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Coinbase, being overweight on Bitcoin and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. He believes Ethereum is overvalued relative to Solana, as more entrepreneurs are building on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. Bitcoin is considered the "best store of value" with product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. While he attempts to [[investment_strategies_in_crypto_markets | play market cycles]], he emphasizes not going "all in" or "all out," typically selling 20-30% at the top and buying double at the bottom to mitigate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.

It has become "almost impossible" to outperform a mix of Bitcoin, Solana, and Coinbase stock in the current cycle, unlike the previous one where massive money printing made it easier for altcoins to pump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>.

### Conditions for "Alt Seasons"
Alt seasons typically require two conditions: a limited number of alt tokens and a large influx of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. In the current cycle, neither condition is met, with thousands of new tokens created daily and less money injected into the system, making broad alt seasons less likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>.

### The Rise of Meme Coins
Despite the challenges, certain sub-classes like meme coins have performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. For a meme coin to last, it needs a "cult leader" and a genuinely good meme that can go viral, often followed by centralized exchange listings (like WIF on Binance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. Wong believes meme coins are here to stay and not a one-cycle phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. He personally sold his WIF holdings, believing it won't outperform Solana on a risk-adjusted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.

## Qualities of Successful Founders

### Key Traits: Autism, Childhood Trauma, Integrity
When investing in early-stage user-facing products, Wong focuses on the founders themselves rather than the initial idea, as ideas often pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. He looks for a "high degree of autism" in founders, believing it allows for independent and contrarian thinking, undisturbed by consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. Additionally, a history of childhood trauma can provide a drive to "prove something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.

> "Autism is how you think. Action is childhood trauma. You want to prove something, you have something to prove." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>

Integrity is considered the "absolute most important quality" for a world-class founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Drawing from Warren Buffett, integrity acts as a multiplier: high intelligence and work ethic with negative integrity leads to destructive outcomes for everyone involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>. Wong notes that being "too rich too quick" can change people, affecting their decision-making and potentially leading to a loss of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.

### The "0 to 1" Game and Problem Solving
Wong enjoys the "zero to one" game of building, which involves figuring out insights about users and experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. He advises founders to solve their own problems, as users often lie in surveys, but one cannot lie to oneself about a needed product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

### Importance of Co-founders
The ideal co-founder configuration involves two people who have worked closely in the past and built trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. Complementary skill sets are also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.

## Personal Reflections and Future Outlook

### Balancing Work and Life
Wong believes in focusing on career and financial stability in one's 20s to reduce stress later in life and allow for better enjoyment of family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. He argues that money *does* correlate with happiness, primarily by removing stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>.

### Health and Longevity
He observes a high overlap between crypto enthusiasts and those interested in longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>. While hoping for a "magical pill," Wong emphasizes that current science points to exercise as the "best drug" for health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>. His personal priorities for longevity are sleep, exercise, and clean eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>.

### Market Predictions
Regarding [[cryptocurrency_market_trends_and_predictions | market predictions]], Wong states that Bitcoin will reach $100K in the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:13">[01:44:13]</a>. He anticipates the cycle's top for Bitcoin could range from $100K to $420,069, humorously alluding to the "simulation" given the previous cycle's peak of $69,420 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>. He predicts political events, like the US election, will cause volatility, but people will "feel alive" whether prices go up or down, as stagnation is more draining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.

Ultimately, Wong believes it's "easy to be great nowadays because most people are weak," referring to psychological and physical weakness, including inability to think independently and focus due to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>.

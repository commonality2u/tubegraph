Anchor Protocol is a platform within the Terra ecosystem that offers stable and attractive yields on [[Importance of Stablecoins in Cryptocurrency | stablecoin]] deposits. It describes itself as offering "better savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:16">[06:16:16]</a>. The yield generated by Anchor is powered by staking returns from multiple proof-of-stake blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:27">[06:27:27]</a>.

## Accessing Anchor Earn

To access Anchor's earning features, users need to visit `anchorprotocol.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:14">[06:14:14]</a> and navigate to the web application by clicking "Web App" in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:31">[06:31:31]</a>, which opens the Anchor Earn page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:39">[06:39:39]</a>.

The first step is to connect a wallet, such as the Terra Station extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:06">[07:06:06]</a>. Upon connection, the wallet address and balance will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:17">[07:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:19">[07:19:19]</a>.

## Earning Yield with UST

Anchor Protocol typically offers an annual percentage yield (APY) hovering around the 20% mark for [[The Role of Stablecoins in Everyday Transactions | stablecoin]] deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:31">[07:31:31]</a>, with a demonstrated rate of 19.42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:25">[07:25:25]</a>. This rate is considered excellent for [[Different Types of Stablecoins | stablecoins]] in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:56">[07:56:56]</a>, especially when compared to centralized finance (CeFi) platforms like Celsius or Nexo, which might offer 8-16% depending on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:42">[07:42:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:45">[07:45:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:48">[07:48:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:51">[07:51:51]</a>.

### Deposit Process

To deposit UST, users click the "Deposit" button and enter the desired amount, ensuring sufficient UST remains in their wallet to cover transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:19">[08:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:21">[08:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:23">[08:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:25">[08:25:25]</a>. A confirmation box displays the transaction fee and total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:44">[08:44:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:48">[08:48:48]</a>. After proceeding, the Terra Station extension will prompt for password confirmation to authorize the contract interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:56">[08:56:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Once submitted, the transaction is broadcasted and completed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:19">[09:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:21">[09:21:21]</a>.

Upon successful deposit, interest accrues immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:55">[09:55:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:57">[09:57:57]</a>. The Anchor Earn page also features a simple calculator to estimate daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly returns based on the deposited amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:03">[10:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:05">[10:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:07">[10:07:07]</a>.

### Withdrawal Process

Withdrawing funds from Anchor Earn follows a similar process to depositing. Users click "Withdraw," select the amount (e.g., max), and proceed through the Terra Station confirmation, which incurs a small transaction fee (e.g., 25 cents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:34">[11:34:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:37">[11:37:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:41">[11:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:45">[11:45:45]</a>.

## Borrowing Functionality and ANC Rewards

Anchor Protocol also offers a "Borrow" function, allowing users to provide bonded Luna (bLuna) as collateral to take out a loan, typically in UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:23">[12:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:27">[12:27:27]</a>. This feature can result in a "net APR" where the protocol effectively pays users to borrow, distributing ANC tokens as rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:40">[12:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:44">[12:44:44]</a>.

To utilize this, Luna must first be "bonded" into bLuna. This involves selecting a validator and confirming the transaction, which also incurs a UST fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:11">[13:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:15">[13:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:18">[13:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:27">[13:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:30">[13:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:36">[13:36:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:39">[13:39:39]</a>. Once bLuna is available, it can be provided as collateral. The platform displays the loan-to-value (LTV) percentage and a borrow limit (e.g., 60% of collateral value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:24">[15:24:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:27">[15:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:31">[15:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:34">[15:34:34]</a>.

### Risks of Borrowing

Users must closely monitor their collateral levels and LTV ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:10">[17:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:12">[17:12:12]</a>. Unlike traditional lending platforms, DeFi loans can be liquidated automatically if the LTV goes too high, without prior human notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:18">[17:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:20">[17:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:21">[17:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:24">[17:24:24]</a>.

A strategy involves depositing the borrowed UST back into Anchor Earn to further increase yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:37">[17:37:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:41">[17:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:45">[17:45:45]</a>.

### ANC Governance Tokens

Borrowing and bonding on Anchor Protocol rewards users with ANC governance tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:56">[17:56:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:01">[18:01:01]</a>. These tokens can be staked to earn additional yield (e.g., 9.73% APY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:42">[18:42:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:47">[18:47:47]</a>. Holding ANC tokens also grants the ability to vote on proposals that affect the Anchor Protocol system, such as onboarding new collateral types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:26">[19:26:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:28">[19:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:30">[19:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:42">[19:42:42]</a>.

### Repaying Loans and Unbonding Luna

To repay a loan, users return to the borrow page, select "Repay," and confirm the transaction, which includes a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:21">[20:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:24">[20:24:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:26">[20:26:26]</a>. After repaying, the bonded Luna must be "withdrawn" from collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:10">[21:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:11">[21:11:11]</a>.

Finally, to convert bonded Luna back to Luna, users must "burn" their bLuna via the "Bond" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:11">[22:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:13">[22:13:13]</a>. A significant drawback is that default bLuna redemptions take at least 21 days to process, potentially up to 24 days due to batch processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:47">[22:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:49">[22:49:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:52">[22:52:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:59">[22:59:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:01">[23:01:01]</a>. Slashing events during this period could also affect the final amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:52">[22:52:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:54">[22:54:54]</a>.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder and ex-CEO of BitMEX and now CIO at Maelstrom Fund, is a popular macroeconomics writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. He frequently discusses the state of the global economy, the role of central banks, and the potential for a societal reset.

## The End Game: Societal Reset

Hayes believes that the "end game" of current [[economic_theories_and_future_inflation_trends | macroeconomic trends]] is some form of societal reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While hoping it's not as severe as the Great Depression or World Wars I and II, he suggests the world is heading in a similar direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This reset will force people to make stark choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, potentially leading to a focus on basic needs like housing and food supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

## Macroeconomic Philosophy: Keynesian Theory and Debt

Hayes critiques the pervasive Keynesian economic theory, where governments are expected to solve every problem by spending money and plugging holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. This theory has been adopted globally, leading to a massive accumulation of debt since World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

After WWII, the U.S. was the primary productive economic unit, using hydrocarbon resources to create wealth that was then spent on various social programs or defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. However, humanity has seen a plateau in productivity from hydrocarbons and a decline in birth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Despite this, societies continue to pile on debt, expecting rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Every crisis has been met with governments running deficits and central banks printing money to save the banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

## Current Economic Predicament

Hayes argues that government authorities have "destroyed the free market" within the fiat financial system, making almost everything a manipulated market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. The only market that remains "almost free-ish" is the government bond market due to its immense size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

Current challenges include:
*   Declining productivity in resource extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.
*   Political choices moving away from hydrocarbons, increasing energy costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
*   Decreased global integration, with countries seeking value-added products and increased prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

These factors contribute to inflation, which governments cannot simply "will out of existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Hayes distinguishes between asset price inflation (which has been ongoing) and inflation that directly impacts the common person, such as rising food and rent costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. This tangible inflation generates public anger, forcing governments to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

Governments face a dilemma: they must fight inflation by restraining credit growth and reducing economic activity, but this conflicts with their massive debt obligations and promises (e.g., healthcare, education, defense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Since raising taxes is unpopular, politicians are more likely to use the "printing press" to inflate their way out of problems, prioritizing re-election over "sober truth" about inability to fulfill promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

Hayes predicts that the world is about to see the "biggest Fiat money printing bubble ever" in the coming years, primarily to save the global sovereign bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.

### Regional Outlooks

*   **Japan:** Seen as lighting the "match" of a global crisis due to its extreme money printing and government bond dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **China:** The "fire burns brightest" here, influenced by Japan's choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.
*   **Europe:** Predicted to be "destroyed" due to internal conflicts over the Euro and potential for war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   **America:** Should be "fine" due to self-sufficiency in food and energy, as well as population growth and secure borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

## Financial System Insolvency

Hayes states that the entire fiat financial system, including banks, pension funds, and insurance products, is essentially insolvent if proper accounting and valuation rules were applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

During 2020-2021, banks saw massive deposit inflows due to COVID stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. Regulators encouraged banks to buy government debt, as it was made highly profitable through accounting rules (e.g., infinite leverage without counting against capital requirements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. This led banks to purchase government debt at historically low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. However, when inflation rose and central banks increased interest rates, bond yields went up, and bond prices went down, rendering the banking system "insolvent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

The key question now is who will bear the cost of bailing out the financial services sector, which becomes a political decision unique to each country's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Role

Hayes's view on Bitcoin in this [[the_significance_of_macroeconomic_trends_in_the_crypto_space | macroeconomic]] context is that "whatever the Fed does, Bitcoin is gonna buy the dip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

He argues that two scenarios benefit Bitcoin:
1.  **Lower Interest Rates:** To help the insolvent financial system, central banks could lower interest rates, which would be good for asset prices, especially risk assets like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.
2.  **Continued High Rates and Bailouts:** If central banks continue to fight inflation by increasing interest rates, insolvent companies and banks will go bankrupt, necessitating bailouts through money printing, which is also good for Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

This implies that, in both scenarios, [[cryptocurrency_market_trends_and_predictions | everything aligns for crypto]] to rise, similar to the post-COVID period in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. The focus for investors should be on constructing a portfolio with asymmetric returns on the upside that is not costly to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. It's about being patient and staying invested long enough to "reap the rewards of the next bull market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

[[ethereums_performance_challenges_and_limitations | Ethereum]] (ETH) has faced significant challenges, including a painful performance in USD and BTC terms over the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This has led to questions about its future viability, with some narratives suggesting that "ETH is forever cooked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Current Market Sentiment and Challenges
A prevailing skeptical view posits that [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] is "cooked," and its extensive ecosystem, including its layer one and [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | layer twos]], is fundamentally broken, leading to scenarios where platforms like Solana could "take everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

However, an alternative perspective suggests that [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] has "overbuilt capacity" for its current needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. While adjustments to the accrual mechanism back to the layer one may occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, the underlying infrastructure is considered robust.

## The EVM as a Competitive Advantage
The [[the_role_of_the_ethereum_virtual_machine_evm_in_blockchain_development | Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)]] is likened to Microsoft in the enterprise sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Just as major banks, insurance companies, and corporations globally predominantly use Microsoft products over Apple or Google, the [[the_role_of_the_ethereum_virtual_machine_evm_in_blockchain_development | EVM]] benefits from an "enterprise sales model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Once embedded, it is "almost impossible to extract it from a business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, similar to how banks continue to use COBOL because changing systems is costly and risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Suitability for Financial Markets
[[ethereums_role_and_infrastructure_in_financial_markets | Ethereum]] is seen as having passed its "Lindy effect," meaning its longevity suggests future viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. It is considered to work "very well for what the financial markets need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

Key aspects include:
*   **Layer 2 Solutions**: [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | Layer 2 solutions]] (e.g., as demonstrated by Coinbase) can be built to meet specific needs, providing perfect functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Layer 1 Security**: The layer 1 chain can be utilized for high-security requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Institutional Adoption**: When considering institutional adoption, it is highly unlikely that major financial players like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan will build on platforms such as Solana or Sui <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Instead, they are highly likely to build their own [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | layer twos]] on [[ethereum_and_smart_contracts | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Goldman Sachs, for example, has been in the blockchain space since 2015 and has been building on [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This preference is attributed to the nature of risk in the financial space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Yield**: [[ethereums_role_and_infrastructure_in_financial_markets | Ethereum]] offers a yield, making it an "understandable" and "very good product for financial markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

## [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Evolution and Future Narrative]]
It is anticipated that [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] will catch a new narrative that will help it lift and catch up in the market, potentially outperforming Bitcoin for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

This [[evolution_and_competition_among_blockchain_ecosystems | evolution]] is compared to Bitcoin's journey in the previous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Bitcoin initially faced a "midcurve" phase where its utility for Lightning payments was heavily discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, but ultimately settled on a narrative of being a "store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

Similarly, [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] needs a clearly defined and persistent narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This is expected to revert to the "world computer idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a> â€“ a platform for tokenization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. This process involves a "midcurve" moment where everything about the platform is questioned before returning to its foundational purpose: "a compute platform that operates at global scale and is decentralized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

[[Insights into building and managing a business in the crypto industry | Building and managing a crypto fund]] is a complex endeavor in a rapidly evolving market. Arthur Chang, founder and CIO of Defiance Capital, a leading liquid crypto fund, highlights key aspects that contribute to success and sustainability in this dynamic space.

## Core Principles and Objectives

A crypto fund's primary objective, or "North Star," is to generate strong returns while adhering to its investment philosophy and approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This means [[building wealth in crypto | outperforming Bitcoin]] significantly over a two-to-three-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. For instance, if Bitcoin yields 100-200% returns, a top fund aims for 300-400% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This becomes increasingly challenging with larger capital under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Challenges and Strategies

### Talent Retention
One of the biggest challenges for an [[insights_into_building_and_managing_a_business_in_the_crypto_industry | investing team in crypto]] is retaining top talent, especially in a fast-paced environment where individuals can quickly accumulate wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The only way to mitigate high turnover, though not perfectly solve it, is to offer talent a significant upside tied to the fund's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Outperforming Bitcoin
[[Investment strategies and managing risk in crypto | Outperforming Bitcoin]] is extremely difficult, with approximately 80% of crypto funds failing to do so, whether they are liquid or venture funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. This mirrors traditional finance where 96% of funds don't beat the S&P 500's buy-and-hold strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. For individual investors, outperforming Bitcoin is doable for those who are full-time and manage less than $5 million in capital; beyond that, it becomes significantly harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Market Maturation and Efficiency
The crypto market is maturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. While speculation and "degenerate" activities like meme coin rallies still occur, capital has become more efficient. Investors are ruthless in selling assets that don't perform and quickly reallocating to opportunities with potential, demonstrating a heightened awareness of opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Market patience has decreased; if a narrative or project doesn't show significant progress within about a year, skepticism grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

### Rebuilding and Resilience
Successfully rebuilding a fund after market downturns requires a deep sense of self-belief and a persistent desire to prove capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. For Arthur, doing it twice under different and more challenging conditions validated his investing and [[building_sustainable_crypto_portfolios | fund-building abilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Investing in crypto is akin to a competitive sport, where good decisions can lead to 10x or 20x differences in outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## Key Investment Factors and Philosophy

### Conviction and First Principles
To endure inevitable market downturns and stay committed, investors must return to first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Understanding what genuinely attracts one to crypto beyond just making money – such as its ability to reduce artificial friction created by human social constructs and its powerful fundamental value propositions – provides a "North Star" and a floor for how low crypto can go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Mental Flexibility and Judgment
Mental flexibility is critical for both builders and investors. The best distinguish themselves by having good judgment to know *when* to be flexible and *when* to stick to their convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>. This often comes down to entrepreneurial instinct rather than scientific analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>.

### Investment Framework
When making high-conviction plays, a fund considers several elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>:
*   **Fundamentals:** Strong underlying value and metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.
*   **Mindshare:** The project's ability to capture attention and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.
*   **Founder/Team:** Quality, vision, execution, and trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. Teams that focus on building rather than constant social media presence, yet still generate good engagement when they do communicate, tend to be more respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>.
*   **Narrative:** Alignment with prevailing or emerging market stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>.
*   **Macro Context:** Broader market and economic conditions, including the current bull market phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>.
*   **Airdrop Dynamics:** For projects with airdrops, understanding if recipients are mercenary farmers or genuine community members who will hold or even buy more tokens at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. Projects with a "full fair launch" ethos, without traditional VC funding, often garner stronger community belief and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.

## Market Influences and Future Outlook

### US Election Impact
The US election outcome, with the prospect of a more crypto-friendly administration, represents an "impossible scenario" that was not widely expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. This shift from a hostile to a potentially promoting government stance is a structural change not fully digested by non-US markets or builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a>. It's expected to accelerate crypto adoption institutionally and retail-wise, reducing risk for players to get involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

### Cycles and Macro Factors
The classic four-year crypto cycle, primarily driven by Bitcoin halving, is becoming less relevant as Bitcoin's market influence diminishes with each subsequent halving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:32">[01:46:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:40">[01:46:40]</a>. Instead, macro conditions and liquidity cycles will increasingly influence Bitcoin's price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:22">[01:47:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:28">[01:47:28]</a>. The industry may experience a "golden age" for builders over the next four years due to a more favorable regulatory environment in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">[01:35:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>.

## Advice for Newcomers

*   **Filter Signal from Noise:** New crypto participants must develop the skill to discern who to listen to and who to disregard, always exercising their own judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:32">[01:48:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>. Be wary of those who speak primarily to benefit their own position rather than offering genuine insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.
*   **Avoid Borrowing Conviction:** Relying solely on others' convictions without developing one's own understanding often leads to poor outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:36">[01:49:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:09">[01:52:09]</a>. Even if lucky once, it's not sustainable without personal conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:25">[01:52:25]</a>.
*   **Play to Your Strengths:** Success in crypto isn't limited to active trading. It can come from building, working with projects, or creating content. Find the approach that best suits one's skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:55">[01:48:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:49:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>.

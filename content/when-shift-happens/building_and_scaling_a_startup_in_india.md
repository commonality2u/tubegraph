Nishal Shetty, founder of WazirX and Shardeum, highlights the unique opportunities and challenges of [[Building and scaling a successful business | building and scaling a successful business]] in India. If a product can be successfully built and scaled in India, it can be launched anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Many global web3 founders are developing or already have an India strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, with venture capital firms like Antler VC prioritizing investments in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Why India is a Key Market for Startups

India presents an incredible opportunity for entrepreneurs due to several factors:
*   **Massive Market Size** India has a population of over 1.2 to 1.3 billion people, providing a colossal addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Open Market and Language Accessibility** Unlike some large markets, India is perceived as an open market where foreign entities can compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The widespread use and understanding of English minimize language barriers for global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Young and Tech-Savvy Population** India has a predominantly young population, with the largest segment in the 20 to 40 age group, who are highly tech-savvy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. This facilitates easy adoption of new technologies and mobile-first products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Scalability Training Ground** Successfully scaling a product in India, even with lower per-customer ticket sizes, provides invaluable experience in handling large user bases and managing customer support at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Rapid Crypto Adoption** India's crypto market has experienced massive growth, from approximately 5 million users in 2018 to over 35 million today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This is projected to exceed 100 million in the next 3 to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Shetty notes, "Indians come slow to a technology but when they come they come in huge numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Challenges and Areas for Improvement

Despite its potential, India faces certain challenges, particularly within the web3 ecosystem:
*   **Protective Mindset** There's a "protective mindset" among key traditional industry players and government bodies who are resistant to new technologies like crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This often manifests as fear of innovation and attempts to prevent inevitable progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion** India, as a "startup nation," needs to increase its risk-taking appetite to compete globally and narrow the gap in the number of unicorns compared to more developed nations like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Cultural Focus on "Safe" Professions** A strong cultural emphasis on professions like engineering and medicine provides perceived stability and guaranteed financial outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:25]</a>. This mindset, while ensuring security, can inadvertently hinder a broader embrace of [[Entrepreneurship and resilience in tech | entrepreneurship and resilience in tech]] and risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Interestingly, those who cannot pursue these traditional paths often become entrepreneurs, as they have less to lose and are more willing to take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

## Nishal Shetty's Approach to Startup Building

Nishal Shetty shares insights from his own journey, emphasizing key principles:

### Building What People Need
The first and most important step is to build something people genuinely need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Finding this need is the hardest part, but once identified, it forms the foundation for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. His first startup, Crowdfire, stemmed from a personal problem of managing Twitter followers, which turned out to be a common need for 20 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:58]</a>. Similarly, WazirX was born out of his own difficulty buying Bitcoin in India, highlighting a market gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:14]</a>.

### The ETC Strategy for User Acquisition
Shetty developed the [[The ETC strategy for startup success | ETC strategy for startup success]] to attract users:
*   **Ego (E)**: Tapping into users' pride by offering exclusive access (e.g., Gmail's invite-only system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. This turns customers into marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:10]</a>.
*   **Temptation (T)**: Offering incentives (e.g., crypto airdrops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:49]</a>. This is the easiest and most common method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Curiosity (C)**: Leveraging human curiosity, often through limited or tiered access to information (e.g., LinkedIn's "Who viewed your profile" feature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:21]</a>.

Shetty suggests combining all three elements for the best results, but even one can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:28]</a>.

### Evolution of Business Models
Initially, Crowdfire used a one-time payment model, but Shetty quickly realized the need for continuous customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:42]</a>. Experimenting with yearly and then monthly subscription plans, he found that users were willing to adopt these models, which laid the foundation for a recurring revenue business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:53:29]</a>. This trial-and-error approach was necessary in the absence of established playbooks for SaaS (Software as a Service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:55]</a>.

### [[Entrepreneurship and resilience in tech | Resilience in Adversity]]
The launch of WazirX in 2018 coincided with a bear market and a banking ban in India, leading to many competitors shutting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:07:11]</a>. Instead of waiting, Shetty's team innovated by introducing a peer-to-peer (P2P) trading model where users could transact directly while WazirX custodied the crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:22]</a>. This not only kept the business afloat but also made it profitable and grew its user base to over a million during the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:40]</a>. Shetty also spearheaded the "India Wants Crypto" campaign, tweeting daily to policymakers to advocate for crypto adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:55]</a>.

### Mission-Driven Approach
Shetty emphasizes being mission-driven rather than solely product or profit-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:42]</a>. His personal mission is to bring everyone into the decentralized ecosystem, akin to connecting everyone to the internet in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:49]</a>. This deep belief kept him persistent through bear markets and regulatory challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:28]</a>. A clear mission allows for pivoting and overcoming challenges without losing direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:47:09]</a>.

### [[Building and scaling a successful business | Scaling Leadership]]
As a founder, it's crucial to avoid becoming the sole decision-maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:20]</a>. Shetty learned to delegate power, scheduling specific times for key decisions rather than being constantly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:42]</a>. Cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset within the team is vital, especially in a startup where job security and success are not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:49]</a>. Founders should guide team members to make their own decisions by asking "What do you think we should do?" instead of providing immediate answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:22]</a>. Shetty sees his role as an "unblocker," facilitating decisions, securing funds, and sharing past mistakes to prevent repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Hiring Philosophy
When hiring, Shetty prioritizes a candidate's achievements and experience over academic degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:52]</a>. In today's world, young individuals can showcase skills through blogs, podcasts, YouTube channels, or self-built apps, even without traditional engineering backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:40]</a>.

### Startup vs. Corporate Mindset
Startups should not imitate established companies (e.g., Google's lavish offices or free food) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:47]</a>. Instead, they should embrace agility, remote work, and risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:56]</a>. Boredom is not a sufficient reason to start a company; genuine problems needing solutions are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:40:00]</a>. Startup life involves many "boring" tasks like finance, content writing, and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:38]</a>.

### Importance of Self-Awareness and Persistence
Success in a startup requires self-awareness to know when to pivot and avoid "hitting against a wall" endlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:46:32]</a>. While persistence is crucial, it must be in the right direction. A clear mission acts as a compass, allowing for flexibility and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:47:03]</a>.

### The Rise of Decentralized Ecosystems
Shetty's journey from a centralized social media management app (Crowdfire) to [[Challenges and strategies in launching and scaling a crypto startup | building a decentralized blockchain]] (Shardeum) was driven by the inherent risks of centralized platforms (e.g., API changes by Facebook/Twitter/Apple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:58:18]</a>. He advocates for decentralization because it offers true free speech, privacy, and user ownership, free from the control of single entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:40:15]</a>.

The shift to web3 is seen as an evolution towards greater online freedom and value ownership, a continuation of web1's information freedom and web2's interactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:51:25]</a>. While challenges remain in making web3 user-friendly (e.g., high transaction fees, complex UX), Shetty believes that experienced entrepreneurs can simplify these issues, making decentralized systems accessible to billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:26:07]</a>.

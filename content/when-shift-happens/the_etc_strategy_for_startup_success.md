The ETC strategy is a framework developed by Nishan to attract users to a product by tapping into fundamental human motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. It posits that if you want to attract people to your product, you need to tap into at least one of these three elements: Ego, Temptation, or Curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. Ideally, a product's go-to-market strategy would incorporate all three, but even one can be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

## Components of the ETC Strategy

The three components of the ETC strategy are:

### E for Ego
This element leverages a user's sense of pride or exclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.

*   **Example: Gmail's Invite System**  
    When Gmail launched, access was restricted to those with an invite code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. This created a sense of pride and exclusivity for those who had access, turning them into marketers who would tell their friends about the "cool product" only they could get them into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This tactic has been successfully used by fintech companies like Monzo and Revolut, and is common in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.

### T for Temptation
This is often the easiest and most commonly used element, particularly in Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.

*   **Example: Crypto Airdrops**  
    The promise of "free money" through airdrops is a prime example of temptation, drawing a large number of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

### C for Curiosity
This element works effectively when implemented correctly, prompting users to engage further to satisfy their inquisitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

*   **Example: LinkedIn's "Who viewed your profile" feature**  
    LinkedIn used curiosity to convert users to paid customers by offering a premium feature that revealed who had viewed their profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.

## Applying the ETC Framework
Instead of broadly aiming for "a million users," founders should use this framework to strategize how to incorporate ego, temptation, or curiosity into their product's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This structured approach helps in achieving significant user adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. Nishan utilized this framework from his first startup, Crowdfire, and it has consistently helped him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.

> "How do I use ego in my product? Then a million, forget million, you'll get 10 million users if you can really do it well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>."
> â€” Nishan

This strategy is part of a broader philosophy that emphasizes **solving real problems** that people need solutions for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Nishan's entrepreneurial journey with [[building_and_scaling_a_successful_business | WazirX]] was rooted in solving his own problem of difficulty buying Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>.

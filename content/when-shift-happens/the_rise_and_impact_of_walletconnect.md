WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that securely connects users to decentralized applications (dApps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Founded by Pedro Gomez, it is trusted by over 45 million users and powers more than 275 million connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Mission and Vision
Pedro Gomez's mission is to make [[the_evolution_of_digital_wallets_and_blockchain | wallets]] work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He believes that a future where wallets do not interoperate could lead to a monopoly, with a single wallet dominating the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Sharing market share, while counterintuitive, ultimately helps the entire market grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

The overarching goal of WalletConnect is to unify everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. It aims to prevent a future where a distributed, decentralized, and permissionless [[the_evolution_of_digital_wallets_and_blockchain | blockchain]] is controlled by a single wallet, which would effectively reinvent banks and social media monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This vision extends to enabling [[the_evolution_of_digital_wallets_and_blockchain | wallets]] to connect to *everything*, not just on-chain applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. Examples include connecting to ATMs for cash withdrawal, digital art frames for exhibitions, and even cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

## Origins and Evolution
Pedro Gomez initially identified himself as an engineer, but later realized his greatest value lay in understanding impacts beyond just engineering, particularly connecting people across different roles like designers and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

His journey into [[first_experiences_and_challenges_in_cryptocurrency | crypto]] began while working for a neo-bank in London in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. He was excited about the new generation of banks enabled by Europe's PSD2 directive, which aimed to open up banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. However, he found that neo-banks were still fundamentally flawed, operating under the licenses of larger banks and constrained by regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. A project to create a shared savings account for friends was heavily cut back, highlighting the limitations of traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. This experience led him to discover Ethereum, where he realized that anyone could build a wallet capable of achieving the innovative features neo-banks only dreamed of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

### The Problem WalletConnect Solved
In 2017, building a wallet on Ethereum was challenging because there was no standardized way for wallets to communicate with applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Wallets communicated in different ways, forcing dApp developers to choose which wallets to support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. This created a situation where a wallet could gain a monopoly simply due to a naming convention in its interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. WalletConnect was built to standardize this interface, ensuring that app developers wouldn't have to choose which wallets to serve and preventing wallet monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.

## Impact on Digital Identity
While often portrayed as a financial product, WalletConnect's true goal is to provide a solution for [[the_evolution_of_digital_wallets_and_blockchain | digital identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. Identity, whether physical or digital, often revolves around a name/username and a face/profile picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. However, 90% of the time, legal identity is tied to financial benefits like taxes, salary, or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

Blockchain represents the first truly decentralized form of identity, unlike traditional digital identities (email, Telegram, phone numbers) which are owned by companies and can be shut down by external forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. By ensuring that no single wallet, [[the_evolution_of_digital_wallets_and_blockchain | blockchain]], or WalletConnect itself can control a user's identity, it aims to create a more trustworthy environment for self-sovereign [[the_evolution_of_digital_wallets_and_blockchain | identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

## Decentralization Philosophy and Challenges
WalletConnect initially started with the idea of being a foundation-backed, decentralized project in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. However, this proved impractical for a product with only two wallets, leading them to centralize and seek venture funding around 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.

A key lesson learned is that decentralizing too early can kill product-market fit by sacrificing flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. Decentralization should be adopted when the market demands it, as partners began to express concerns about WalletConnect being a single point of failure around 2022-2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

### Impact of Global Events
The Ukraine war, for instance, highlighted the urgent need for decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. During a period of ambiguity regarding sanctions, WalletConnect briefly ended up sanctioning both Ukraine and Russia, disrupting connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>. This incident underscored that a single company should not be solely responsible for such critical decisions, reinforcing the value of a multi-party system where independent node operators make choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>.

### Solana's Rise and Multichain Support
Initially biased towards Ethereum due to his [[first_experiences_and_challenges_in_cryptocurrency | first experiences]], Pedro Gomez realized the importance of [[challenges_and_strategies_in_expanding_multichain_user_support | multichain user support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. WalletConnect was upgraded to work with virtually every [[Evolution of Cryptocurrency Infrastructure | blockchain]], including Cosmos, Polka Dot, Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

He noted that Ethereum became complacent, allowing Solana to capitalize on opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. Solana's resilience and growth, particularly after the FTX collapse in 2023, demonstrated its ability to attract new users and developers beyond the existing [[innovations_in_digital_payments_and_cryptocurrency | crypto]]native community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>. This growth could not be ignored, leading to a shift in strategy for WalletConnect to seriously engage with Solana by building tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

## Personal Branding and Founder Mindset
The rise of [[the_impact_and_importance_of_personal_branding_in_finance_and_crypto | personal brands]] over corporate brands is a global phenomenon, not limited to [[innovations_in_digital_payments_and_cryptocurrency | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Leaders like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg have heavily invested in their [[the_impact_and_importance_of_personal_branding_in_finance_and_crypto | personal brands]] because they understand the direct impact on their corporate brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>. In the digital world, where attention is paramount, [[the_impact_and_importance_of_personal_branding_in_finance_and_crypto | personal brands]] are more valuable because people seek relationships with individuals rather than empty corporate entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

For founders, building a [[the_impact_and_importance_of_personal_branding_in_finance_and_crypto | personal brand]] requires self-awareness and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. It must fit one's personality and lifestyle, as it cannot be delegated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. While some founders focus on internal team development, others like Pedro Gomez, prefer an outward-facing approach, engaging directly with customers and growing the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. He emphasizes that if no one knows about a product, even the best solution won't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

A founder's role often includes advocating for their product and building relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>. Pedro Gomez views [[current_challenges_and_innovations_in_crypto_venture_investing | investing]] in the space as betting on the "jockey" (founder's dedication and strength) rather than just the "horse" (the idea or white paper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Even a "worst idea" can succeed with a strong founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

### Openness and Standards
WalletConnect's approach advocates for building standards in parallel with products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:43">[01:25:43]</a>. This means building products with openness in mind, avoiding vendor lock-in, which might seem contradictory to building business "moats" in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>. However, history shows that products not built with openness and interoperability often create difficult-to-revert moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:43">[01:26:43]</a>.

To guide the ecosystem, WalletConnect introduced a "certified" program that defines criteria for high-quality wallets, influencing tokenomics and fostering coordination among wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>. This allows the network to implicitly "pick favorites" based on approach and design decisions, rather than specific projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:58">[01:24:58]</a>.

## The Future of WalletConnect
WalletConnect's most impactful future goal is to revolutionize internet login by becoming the universal login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>. With 50,000 applications and 600 wallets collaborating on this mission, WalletConnect believes it can achieve what giants like Google, Facebook, and Apple have attempted but not fully executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a>.

### Prediction: Stablecoins Dominating Commerce
Pedro Gomez predicts that stablecoins will completely dominate commerce in the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. He highlights their efficiency, noting that companies like Robinhood are settling internal accounting with stablecoins, and Stripe is accepting [[innovations_in_digital_payments_and_cryptocurrency | crypto]] payments via stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. This efficiency could lead to stablecoins becoming preferred over traditional digital payment methods like Visa or PayPal, appearing in online shops and services everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>.

Astroport, a new decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Terra ecosystem, is designed as a trustless automated market maker (AMM) for trading tokens. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> To ensure it is owned by its token holders rather than a single entity, Astroport is launching with specific methods for distributing its governance token, ASTRO. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>

## Initial Token Distribution

At launch, 110 million ASTRO governance tokens will be circulating out of a total supply of one billion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> These tokens will be distributed to three main groups:
*   Airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   Phase One: Lock Drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   Phase Two: ASTRO-UST Bootstrapping Pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>

## Astro Airdrop

The Astro airdrop aims to put governance tokens into the hands of active Terra supporters and users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> It is distributed to two groups of "t5 chads" who are currently active in the Terra ecosystem: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
1.  **Luna Stakers**: 12.5 million ASTRO tokens are allocated for Luna stakers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> The snapshot for eligibility was taken on September 9th, 2021. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
2.  **Liquidity Providers (LPs) on TerraSwap**: 12.5 million ASTRO tokens are allocated for LPs on TerraSwap. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> Users with liquidity in TerraSwap pools exceeding $1 million USD worth of liquidity on September 9th, 2021, are eligible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> The specific LP token concerned is the Luna-UST pair. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>

Airdrop recipients have the option to pre-claim and lock their ASTRO tokens into the [[astroports_tokenomics_and_launch_details | ASTRO-UST liquidity bootstrapping pool]] (Phase Two) to receive additional ASTRO tokens before Astroport's December 20th launch. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>

## Phase One: Lock Drop

The Phase One lock drop is designed for users to migrate their existing TerraSwap liquidity into Astroport. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> By locking their liquidity in Astroport, users receive a distribution of ASTRO tokens. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> A total of 75 million ASTRO tokens will be distributed this way. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>

### Supported Tokens for Lock Drop
The following tokens are supported for the lock drop, with their respective percentages of the 75 million ASTRO allocation:
*   Luna-UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>
*   [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] (ANC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>
*   bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
*   Mirror Protocol (MIR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
*   Orion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>
*   StT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
*   Mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   Apollo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   Valkyrie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
*   [[nexus_protocol_v1_vaults_launch | Nexus Protocol]] (NEXUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>

Luna-UST has the largest percentage allocation, while [[nexus_protocol_v1_vaults_launch | Nexus Protocol]] has the smallest at 3%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>

### Phase One Timeline and Rules
The Phase One lock drop runs from December 6th to December 13th. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
*   **First 5 days**: TerraSwap LPs can migrate their liquidity to Astroport and receive a one-time ASTRO distribution upon product launch on December 20th. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   **Four days (liquidity migration)**: Users have four days to migrate liquidity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>
*   **After migration**: Up to 50% of the migrated liquidity can be withdrawn from Astroport. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>
*   **Last day of Phase One**: The maximum withdrawal amount reduces to zero percent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

## Phase Two: ASTRO-UST Bootstrapping Pool

Phase Two involves users locking ASTRO (received from the airdrop or Phase One) and/or UST into an ASTRO-UST liquidity bootstrap pool. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> This phase serves to provide initial liquidity for ASTRO tokens and act as a price discovery period. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> A total of 10 million ASTRO tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers who commit ASTRO and/or UST to this pool. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>

### Phase Two Timeline and Rules
*   **Four days**: Users have four days to lock ASTRO and/or UST into the pool. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>
*   **Three days prior to launch**: This is the last day to add ASTRO and/or UST. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
*   **Two days prior to launch**: This is the final opportunity to withdraw up to 50% of the migrated liquidity from the LP pool. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
*   **Final day before launch**: Up to 50% of UST can be withdrawn at the start of the day, with the amount linearly falling to zero. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>

### Key Considerations for Phase Two
*   **ASTRO Sources**: ASTRO is not live or tradable during Phase Two. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> Any ASTRO deposited must come from either ASTRO credits received from Phase One or pre-claimed airdrop ASTRO. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>
*   **Deposit Flexibility**: Users can commit ASTRO and UST in any configuration: ASTRO and UST, just ASTRO, or just UST. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   **Conversion**: Any deposits are converted into ASTRO-UST LP tokens. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> If only one asset is deposited, it will be converted into a 50/50 share when the pool closes, meaning users will receive both ASTRO and UST upon redemption. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>
*   **No ASTRO Withdrawal**: Once ASTRO tokens are deposited during Phase Two, they cannot be withdrawn until the lock expires. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
*   **Price Discovery**: The price of ASTRO will be determined by the amount and ratio of UST and ASTRO users add to the pool. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> Single-sided deposits will directly affect the pool's ratio and the implied price of ASTRO. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>
*   **Allocation**: There is no advantage to being the first to deposit. ASTRO allocation is determined by the percentage of the total pool owned when the snapshot is taken at the end of Phase Two. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>

Astroport is set to launch on December 20th. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>

## Astro Generators

After Astroport's launch, some projects may award third-party governance tokens (e.g., [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] or Mirror Protocol) for liquidity locked in Astroport's lock drop, if those projects choose to use Astroport's "Astro Generators." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> Astro Generators are designed to distribute dual rewards, similar to how some protocols offer yield in-kind plus a supplementary yield in their governance token. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>

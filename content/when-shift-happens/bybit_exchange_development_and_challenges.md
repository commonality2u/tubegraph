Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, leads the world's third-largest crypto exchange by volume, with a daily trading volume estimated at over $12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The company currently serves 20 million customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a> and has offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

## Genesis and Initial Problem Solving
Ben Zhou's background in Forex trading, where he became proficient in building Forex brokers and user acquisition, inspired him to enter the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. He observed the [[Challenges and processes of crypto token listing and exchanges | crypto exchange]] landscape around 2017, noting issues with existing platforms like BitMEX and OKX, including user interface difficulties and system overloads during market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

Bybit was founded with the primary goal of solving these reliability and scalability problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>, aiming to build a more stable and intuitive derivatives exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.

## Early Development and Challenges
Despite Zhou's experience in Forex, he quickly realized that the crypto exchange model was fundamentally different, requiring in-house product, engineering, and coding expertise, unlike Forex brokers which largely rely on modularized third-party solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. This meant his prior Forex contacts and resources were not directly transferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

The early days of Bybit, starting in 2018, were tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. Investors were skeptical of a new startup competing with giants like BitMEX, which held a significant market share and appeared to have all the money and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. Bybit struggled to attract initial clients for the first two to three months after launching its first product, the BTC USD inverse contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

## Revolutionary Affiliate Program
Recognizing the stagnant customer acquisition strategies of existing exchanges (simple referral links with no transparency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>, Ben Zhou directed his development team to pause exchange feature development and instead build a comprehensive affiliate portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>. This was a radical shift from the typical "pay per shield" model prevalent in the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

Bybit's affiliate portal provided:
*   **Transparency**: Influencers could see exactly how many clicks, sign-ups, deposits, and commissions their unique links generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.
*   **Tools and Analytics**: It offered advanced CRM features, allowing partners to generate custom links for different channels (e.g., YouTube, Twitter) and compare conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **Community Engagement**: Partners could easily launch competitions for their communities with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

This strategy quickly gained significant traction, bringing in hundreds and then thousands of new users almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>. Bybit became the first exchange to successfully onboard a large number of affiliates and YouTubers, rapidly building its liquidity and user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.

## Growth and Market Share in a Dynamic Environment
Bybit gained significant market share, particularly between 2018 and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. This growth was partly attributed to the [[Cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem challenges | challenges]] faced by its competitors, notably BitMEX. As BitMEX encountered legal scrutiny, compliance demands (such as implementing KYC when the industry was not ready for it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>, and leadership changes (like Arthur Hayes' departure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>, users sought alternatives, and Bybit was ready to fill that void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

Today, Bybit holds approximately 15% to 18% of the market share, compared to Binance's roughly 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>. Its daily trading volume has recently reached around $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>.

## Regulatory Landscape and Future Outlook
Bybit moved its operations to Singapore approximately two to three years ago, drawn by Singapore's initial progressive stance on crypto regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. However, the regulatory environment has shifted dramatically, especially after the FTX collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>. Due to the significant number of FTX victims in Singapore (partly facilitated by access through Singapore's national digital ID, Singpass) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>, public and political perception towards crypto has become very conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.

As a result, while Singapore continues to embrace blockchain technology, it is now extremely cautious about crypto trading and retail access, especially with recent money laundering crackdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>. Bybit applied for a license but has not yet received it, and consequently, it does not operate for Singaporean users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>.

Looking ahead, Ben Zhou predicts a positive outlook for the crypto market in the next 12 months, anticipating the approval of Bitcoin ETFs will open the gates for significant retail inflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:12">[01:49:12]</a>.

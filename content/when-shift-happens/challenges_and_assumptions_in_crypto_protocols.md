Developing and launching crypto protocols involves navigating significant [[Challenges and risks in the crypto ecosystem | challenges and risks]], often stemming from initial assumptions and the nascent nature of the industry. Founders frequently encounter issues related to high transaction costs, gaining user traction, and establishing market fit in a volatile environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Initial Assumptions and Realizations

When Pendle V1 launched in June 2021, many assumptions were made, including the belief that all transactions should be on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This led to an end-to-end transaction potentially costing a user around $1,000 in gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This costly oversight was a "moment of realization" for the founder, highlighting the need for optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.

A significant lesson learned from early experiences, like with Kyber in 2018, was the importance of foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. At the time, Kyber's daily trading volume was around $50,000-$100,000, while centralized exchanges like Binance were doing hundreds of millions or billions, leading to doubts about the future of decentralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. The subsequent DeFi Summer in 2020, where protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound — which started around 2017-2018 — gained massive adoption after two to three years, proved that initial lack of traction doesn't necessarily mean a project is without future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

## Product, Distribution, and Attention

A core [[Challenges and opportunities in the crypto ecosystem | challenge]] in crypto is the balance between product development and distribution. Early-stage founders often focus heavily on product, assuming that a great product will naturally gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. However, without effective distribution and marketing, even technologically meaningful products can become irrelevant due to lack of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

For Pendle V2, launched in December 2022, a strong emphasis was placed on iterative product development, business development (BD), and growth efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Recognizing the complexity of V1's product, V2 invested heavily in educational materials and distribution channels to make the product more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### The Role of Narrative and Strategic Partnerships

Positioning the protocol within dominant trends and narratives is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Pendle's strategy involved identifying "big money movements" in the market and aligning the protocol to help users capitalize on these opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Examples include:
*   **LST (Liquid Staking Tokens) in early 2023:** Partnering with dominant players like Rocket Pool, Balancer, and Aura to collectively market a new product line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Arbitrum and Restaking Narratives:** Capitalizing on these trends to position Pendle for liquidity and capital flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Points System:** Leveraging mechanisms like EigenLayer's points system, which awards points for early deposits, to bootstrap liquidity and incentivize participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>. Pendle enhanced this by negotiating multipliers, allowing users to earn three times the points by depositing through Pendle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. This strategic move funnelled significant liquidity, leading to Pendle's TVL growing from $5 million to nearly $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

## Inherent Risks and Investor Behavior

The crypto industry faces inherent risks and volatility. While high APYs (e.g., 10,000-20,000%) are attractive, there's also a desire for certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Products like Pendle aim to provide this certainty through fixed rates, though the market often prioritizes speculative gains during bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.

A significant [[Challenges and Mistakes in Crypto Investing | challenge]] for investors is resisting the temptation to chase high returns from "shitcoins" or meme coins, which often lead to losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. Many experienced individuals, having learned through "getting wrecked" in ICOs or other volatile investments, advocate for sticking to blue-chip assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum and avoiding unnecessary risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Exiting large positions in illiquid meme coins can also be extremely difficult without influencing the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.

## Persistence and Mindset

A key [[Challenges and perspectives in the crypto industry | challenge]] for founders is determining when to persist and when to "throw in the towel" on a project that isn't gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. In crypto, where products can take years to find product-market fit, persistence is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. Pendle sustained through a low-adoption period for two years, driven by the conviction that instruments offering certainty in a volatile financial sector would eventually see adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

The ability to navigate known and unknown [[Challenges in the crypto industry | challenges]] requires strong self-belief and the capacity to motivate others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. Founders must be willing to adapt, learn from user interactions, and continuously improve their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Ultimately, while a solid product is the baseline, effectively reaching the target audience and positioning the protocol within key trends makes the biggest difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

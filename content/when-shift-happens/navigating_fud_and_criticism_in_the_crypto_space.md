The crypto industry, particularly Web3, presents unique [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | challenges]] for founders and projects, especially concerning Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) and criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Unlike traditional businesses, founders in Web3 often face direct and personal questioning from the community, sometimes through social media DMs, LinkedIn, or Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. To survive in this environment, it's argued that one must perceive FUD as "fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Personal Experiences with FUD
Initially, FUD and criticism could be deeply offensive, sometimes incorporating racial slurs such as "Indian brown scammer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>. This personal targeting can be intense, especially for new founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Over time, however, a shift in mindset occurs, from being scared and worried to viewing such comments with indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Being a first-time founder in a rapidly evolving space like NFTs made it challenging to deal with criticism initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The instinct was to passionately defend the project against teasing about floor prices, art, or the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. However, this often meant "feeding them," encouraging trolls and haters to continue the conversation and provoke emotional responses, leading to regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Strategies for [[managing_criticism_and_risk_as_a_crypto_founder | Managing FUD and Criticism]]
Several strategies are crucial for founders to [[navigating_criticisms_and_managing_influence_in_the_crypto_industry | navigate criticisms]] and maintain well-being:

*   **Strong Team Support**: Having a cohesive and supportive team is vital, especially when facing frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Regular weekly team meetings where members can openly discuss frustrations, personal issues, or anything else without judgment act as a stress-buster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **The "24-Hour Rule"**: This involves taking a breath and delaying responses (e.g., emails, tweets) when feeling angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Writing out frustrated thoughts in a draft (like Twitter drafts) but not immediately publishing them allows for reflection and prevents public outbursts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Not Engaging Trolls**: Through experience, founders learn that engaging with trolls and haters only fuels their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Learning from Others**: Observing experienced founders like Luca (Pudgy Penguins) or Zagabond (Azuki), who have endured significant FUD, can provide valuable lessons on how to avoid responding to provocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Community Defense**: Recognizing that a project's community will often defend it, negates the need for founders to personally engage in every argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Distinguishing FUD from Constructive Criticism
It's crucial to differentiate between baseless FUD and legitimate constructive criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Not all negative statements are FUD; some are valid points that, upon reflection, indicate areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Addressing these criticisms is essential, as avoiding them is akin to "running away from problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Transparency and Founder Commitment
In Web3, especially when raising funds from the community, transparency from founders is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. This includes being open about salaries, as lack of disclosure can lead to accusations of unaccountable fund burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.

Founder commitment, such as publicly committing personal funds or salary to buy the project's token from the open market, builds trust and demonstrates belief in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. Setting clear, performance-based unlocks for team tokens (e.g., tokens only unlock after achieving a specific market cap) also aligns founder incentives with investor interests and prevents premature token dumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>. This means teams are primarily incentivized by their salaries and the project's long-term success, not by immediate token unlocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## Resilience and Adaptation
The future of any business, especially in Web3, depends on a contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. Success in the crypto space is not just about hard work, effort, and vision, but also about a bit of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. The most important component for luck to materialize is resilience, akin to a "cockroach" in its ability to survive and persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.

Founders must be ready to pivot and accept when things are not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>. Ego can be detrimental, leading to failure if one stubbornly adheres to a strategy that is clearly failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. Experiencing both bull and bear markets provides invaluable lessons for long-term execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.

## Advice for the Community
Listeners should remember to "give people or teams a fair chance to see their side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. Many genuine teams become victims of poor timing or insufficient funds, rather than incompetence or deliberate malicious acts like "rugging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

It is important to avoid judging teams based on stereotypes, such as their origin or accent, and instead focus on their actions:
*   Did they abandon the project during a bear market and only return during a bull market? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>
*   What have they actually achieved? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>

Listening to founder interviews and podcasts provides a more comprehensive understanding than just reading one-page summaries or relying on perceived prestige (e.g., "ex-Google") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. Videos, in particular, convey more than written words, offering a fair chance for founders to express themselves and share their story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>.

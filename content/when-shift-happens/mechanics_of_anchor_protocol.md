Anchor Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform designed to offer users a stable, high yield on their stablecoin deposits, specifically paying out approximately 20% APR (Annual Percentage Rate) [00:00:32]. This article explores the underlying [[understanding_anchor_protocol_and_its_liquidations | mechanics of Anchor Protocol]] to explain how it generates and sustains this yield. While the core information is available in Anchor's white paper, this overview provides a detailed breakdown based on data from November 23, 2021 [00:00:56].

## Yield Generation Explained

To understand the [[sustainability_of_anchor_protocol | sustainability of Anchor Protocol]], it's crucial to examine its revenue generation and payout requirements [00:01:27].

### Payout Requirements

As of November 23, 2021:
*   **Total Deposits**: Anchor Protocol held 2.42 billion UST in total deposits [00:01:36].
*   **Current Interest Rate**: The platform was paying out 19.8% APR [00:01:42].
*   **Total Payout Needed**: To meet these obligations, Anchor needed to generate 471.4 million UST annually (19.8% of 2.42 billion UST) [00:01:45].

### Revenue Generation

Anchor generates revenue primarily from two sources:
1.  **Yield from Collateralized Loans**: Users who utilize Anchor's [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | borrow function]] must provide collateral, typically bETH (bonded Ethereum) and bLuna (bonded Luna), which is often heavily over-collateralized [00:02:02]. Anchor then deploys this collateral in other DeFi protocols to earn yield [00:02:10].
    *   **bLuna Collateral**:
        *   Amount: 2.76 billion UST worth of bLuna [00:02:27].
        *   Lido Finance Rate: 6.3% [00:02:34].
        *   Yield Generated: 173.8 million UST [00:02:40].
    *   **bETH Collateral**:
        *   Amount: 373 million UST worth of bETH [00:02:56].
        *   Lido Finance Rate: 4.9% [00:03:02].
        *   Yield Generated: 18.3 million UST [00:03:08].
2.  **Interest on Borrowed Funds**: Borrowers also pay an interest rate (Borrow APR) on the UST they take out [00:03:28].
    *   **Total UST Borrowed**: 1.21 billion UST [00:03:21].
    *   **Yield Generated**: 283.14 million UST (from the Borrow APR) [00:03:33].

### Net Revenue Calculation

By combining these revenue streams:
*   Yield from bLuna: 173.8 million UST [00:03:39].
*   Yield from bETH: 18.3 million UST [00:03:44].
*   Interest from borrowed funds: 283.14 million UST [00:03:53].
*   **Total Revenue Generated**: 475.24 million UST [00:04:01].

Comparing the total revenue to the payout requirement:
*   Revenue: 475.24 million UST [00:04:32].
*   Payouts: 471.4 million UST [00:04:18].
*   **Net Surplus**: 3.84 million UST [00:04:44].

This surplus indicates that, at the time of recording, Anchor Protocol was generating more revenue than it needed to cover its 20% yield payouts [00:04:48].

## The Yield Reserve

The surplus revenue (e.g., 3.84 million UST) generated by Anchor Protocol is deposited into its **Yield Reserve** [00:04:55]. This reserve serves as a buffer to:
*   Counteract imbalances in the platform [00:05:00].
*   Cover shortfalls when the Borrow APR or collateral yield is insufficient to meet the savings rate [00:05:02].

At the time of the video, the Yield Reserve stood at approximately 75 million UST, showing consistent growth [00:05:12]. This growing reserve is a key indicator of Anchor's ability to sustain its high interest rates [00:05:18].

## [[Role of Anchor Token in Yield Generation | Role of Anchor Token (ANC)]]

The Anchor Token (ANC) is the governance token of the Anchor Protocol [00:05:57]. It plays a crucial role in the platform's economics:
*   **Offsetting Borrow APR**: ANC tokens are distributed to borrowers to offset their borrow APR, sometimes resulting in borrowers effectively being paid to borrow money [00:06:03].
*   **Incentivization**: This distribution program was designed to incentivize and encourage users to utilize the Anchor platform, initially set to continue until the end of 2024 when the token distribution concludes [00:06:27].

## [[Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of Terra Network | Anchor Protocol as a Backbone of the Terra Network]]

Anchor Protocol has positioned itself as a fundamental component of the Terra Network's DeFi ecosystem [00:06:40]. Many new projects are being developed either directly on Anchor or as plug-ins that integrate with it, leading to increased adoption and cross-chain interconnectivity [00:06:47].

Examples of such projects include:
*   **Orion Protocol**: Uses Anchor as its backend to earn yields. Users can deposit ERC20 tokens into Orion, which then earns yield on their behalf through Anchor at a smart contract level, offering non-native savings platform exposure to users on Polygon, Ethereum, and BSC [00:07:05].
*   **Orca (from Kujira)**: Developed a method for retail users to participate in the [[understanding_anchor_protocol_and_its_liquidations | liquidations contract]] within Anchor [00:07:33].
*   **Kash DeFi**: Aims to bring stablecoins to the masses by allowing users to open savings accounts with IBANs and sort codes, and obtain debit cards to spend UST in the real world [00:08:02].

## [[Sustainability of Anchor Protocol | Sustainability of the 20% Yield]]

In the opinion of the presenter, Anchor Protocol can sustain its 20% yields [00:08:51]. This is supported by:
*   Its transparent yield generation mechanism [00:08:59].
*   Its incentivization of users [00:09:03].
*   Increasing adoption, evident from the number of new wallets created daily on Terra Station [00:09:06].
*   The continuous growth of its Yield Reserve, which allows for the continuation of high interest rates [00:09:17].

## Disclaimer

The calculations presented are based on data from various sources including Lido Finance and Anchor itself, and token prices, all of which are subject to daily variation [00:09:26]. While the exact figures fluctuate, the overall mechanics demonstrate the sustainability of the yield and the platform's growth potential [00:09:42].

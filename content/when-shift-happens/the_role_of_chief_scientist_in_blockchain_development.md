George Nezes, Chief Scientist and Co-founder at Mysten Labs, describes his role as managing the research and development (R&D) side of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. In the context of [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web3]], this position differs significantly from traditional corporate research roles.

## Web3 Chief Scientist vs. Traditional Research

Nezes highlights a key distinction between his current role at Mysten Labs and his previous experience at Microsoft Research:

*   **Traditional Research (e.g., Microsoft Research)**
    *   Operates as a "pure research department" with little direct connection to the company's core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.
    *   Often described as a "sleepy research organization" focused on long-term ideas (20 years out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
    *   Its primary purpose during the Balmer years was often to serve as a public relations tool, demonstrating innovation spending rather than directly contributing to products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
    *   Suffered from a "broken pipeline" where excellent research rarely made it to product development or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

*   **Web3 Chief Scientist (Mysten Labs)**
    *   Described as a "fighting research position" due to the rapid pace and novelty of [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | Web3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   Involves the research team in "every aspect of our operations," from building new protocols and designing solutions for immediate problems to direct operations and public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
    *   Focuses on applying "hot off the press science" directly to real systems, sometimes even before scientific papers are published, to gain a competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   Receives direct market feedback on research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   The core job is to ensure a continuous pipeline between pure science and products that reach the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Key Responsibilities and Impact

As Chief Scientist, Nezes's responsibilities include:

*   **Protocol Design**: He is one of the designers of the Sui [[evolution_and_competition_among_blockchain_ecosystems | L1 protocol]] and the Walrus decentralized storage protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Bridging Science and Product**: His role ensures that the latest advancements in computer science are immediately applied to the real systems being built, making all the difference in their development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Foundational Definition**: His background in computer security helps guide the understanding of what a [[blockchain_and_coordination | blockchain]] is truly good for, moving beyond hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Teaching fundamental concepts provides a grounding for understanding how modern systems function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

The practical application of cutting-edge research is crucial for the success of blockchain projects. Nezes emphasizes that the competitive advantage of networks like Sui or Walrus often stems from directly integrating new scientific discoveries into their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Vision and Philosophy

Nezes views the role of Chief Scientist as central to realizing the [[vision_and_innovation_in_blockchain_technology | vision]] of Mysten Labs: to replace centralized cloud services with decentralized components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a>. This includes Sui replacing the accounting layer and Walrus substituting centralized cloud storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>. This overarching goal aims to reduce the power of intermediaries and provide a more neutral technological foundation for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>. He believes this is a "better future" where technology is neutral and not controlled by a handful of large entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

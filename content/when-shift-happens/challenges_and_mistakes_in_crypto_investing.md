James B, founder of $1.5 billion Digital Finance Group and J Square, is an early investor in various projects including Circle, Ledger, Pudgy Penguins, and Polkadot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. His investment career began informally at age 10, learning about asset valuation from his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This early exposure led him to stock trading in high school, where his parents lent him money, allowing him to keep the profits and gain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. He attributes his success to a combination of skill and luck, with luck still accounting for about one-third of his overall success today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Early Discoveries and Investment Philosophy

While studying mathematics at Fudan University in Shanghai, James discovered Bitcoin through a schoolmate in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. After months of reading whitepapers and books, he realized Bitcoin's potential to solve problems in traditional financial systems, particularly China's high inflation and money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. He viewed Bitcoin as a perfect solution due to its decentralized nature and reasonable inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Most people, he notes, did not understand these underlying financial issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

In 2015, during a bear market, James's family provided him with $20 million to start an investment firm focused on Bitcoin and related businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. He invested most of this capital into Bitcoin, believing in its long-term value despite market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This initial investment grew to over $100 million by the peak of 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## Key Mistakes and Lessons Learned

### Underestimating ICOs and Over-diversification
One of James's "biggest screw-ups" was his approach to the 2017 market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. While he invested in primary market equity deals for exchanges and infrastructure, he largely avoided initial coin offerings (ICOs), as he didn't fully understand their model or value at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. This was a significant missed opportunity, as many became very wealthy from ICO investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:06">[03:04:06]</a>.

Another mistake identified was investing in too many early-stage projects during the last bull market, resulting in over 100 portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. Managing such a large number proved "super hard," making it difficult to keep up with updates and adequately support each project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. He now believes an optimal portfolio size is between 50 to 80 projects, with a focus on supporting mainstream ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

### The 2022 Bear Market and Fixed-Term Lending
The year 2022 was particularly challenging for him and the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. Anticipating a downturn after the 2021 peak, James de-risked his position, holding a significant amount of cash in banks and stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>. However, he made the mistake of lending large sums to platforms like Genesis and BlockFi for stable yields, viewing it as a safer alternative to DeFi due to perceived hacks in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

The collapse of Luna in May 2022 prompted him to pull money back from these platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. However, he later resumed lending to Genesis with fixed-term contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>. When FTX collapsed in November 2022, Genesis was severely impacted, and James could not retrieve his funds due to the fixed terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. This incident resulted in a loss of tens of millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

The key lesson from this experience is that in the high-[[risks_of_crypto_investment | risk]] crypto industry, seeking small, stable returns with high risk "doesn't make any sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. If one desires stability, traditional assets like banks or real estate are more appropriate; crypto should be for seeking high returns at high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. He resolved to "never do fixed-term contracting crypto" and to either pursue big returns with high risk or not invest at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.

The financial losses significantly impacted his mental health, to the point of canceling plans to attend the FIFA World Cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. His team focused on resolving the Genesis issue, but once bankruptcy was declared, the focus shifted to the future, learning from mistakes, and preparing for the next bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

## Investment Strategy Refinements

James's current investment strategy focuses on two deeply undervalued areas:
1.  **Layer-one protocols:** He believes that beyond Ethereum's scalability solutions, there is still significant value in layer-one protocols that can achieve localized adoption and move quicker in certain jurisdictions, even without superior technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. He notes that 90% of VCs in the market lack their own conviction and merely follow major investors like a16z or Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:58">[01:10:58]</a>.
2.  **Applications with mainstream adoption potential:** With existing infrastructure, the next step is to bring more usage into the space through applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>. He highlights DeFi and NFTs as examples, particularly valuing NFTs like Pudgy Penguins for their ability to explain crypto concepts to a broader audience and drive adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Challenges in Crypto

Entrepreneurs in crypto face unique [[challenges_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges]], especially during "winter" periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. The biggest challenge is survival, as few investors commit capital unless projects are performing exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Managing cash flow is critical during these downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>. A key indicator of a good entrepreneur is the ability to raise money during a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.

James emphasizes that entrepreneurs must be:
*   **Passionate and persistent:** They must believe deeply in what they are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.
*   **Forward-thinking:** Unlike others who can back off, entrepreneurs must constantly move forward despite pressures from lack of funding, customer acquisition, or product issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

## Importance of Independent Thinking
A key takeaway from his investment journey is the importance of having an independent thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. Following the crowd in crypto is risky because many VCs and individuals lack deep understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. Independent conviction, coupled with an openness to adapt, is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. Investing, he notes, is a very personal and often lonely endeavor, but it allows one to take full responsibility for successes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

AI is expected to fundamentally change daily life, similar to how transportation and the internet created large impacts in their respective eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is anticipated to have a much bigger impact, potentially 100x all innovations seen until now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Ram Kamar, a core contributor at Open Ledger, emphasizes that AI provides the ability to process and make decisions much better than previous technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## AI as a Transformative Force
AI is described as the "next big thing" after the automobile and the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.
*   **Automobile**: Enabled goods to move faster, significantly impacting industrial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Internet**: Connected people globally much quicker than the industrial era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. The internet serves as an "exocortex" or "rented brain," helping humans gain knowledge and perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

AI is poised to amplify these impacts by a factor of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, making humans much smarter and boosting productivity and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. It is projected to increase the average IQ by at least 10x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a> and can reach places where the internet couldn't, such as providing educational resources in areas like Africa with limited schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

## AI in Daily Interactions and Decision Making
Unlike the internet, which primarily connects people and provides information, AI helps individuals think and process things better, aiding in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Asking ChatGPT for information and decision support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   The evolution of autonomous driving in Tesla, progressing from driving assistance to full self-driving, demonstrating AI's application in real-world tasks <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.

## The Role of Data in AI's Evolution
For AI to create a good [[impact_of_ai_on_human_society | impact]], it needs to be enriched with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Current AI models are largely built and trained on readily available internet data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. However, the "real knowledge" resides with individuals, enterprises, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Enabling people to contribute this data is crucial for enriching AI and making it work as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_ai_agents_in_enhancing_productivity_and_societal_roles | AI Agents]] and Specialized Models
Initially, AI agents were often "stupid" or "meme-like," simply wrappers around generic models like OpenAI or Llama, which are trained on general internet data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. While these generic models are fine for context or tweeting, they are insufficient for operating or executing specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

To enhance [[the_role_of_ai_agents_in_enhancing_productivity_and_societal_roles | AI agents]] and enable them to perform specialized tasks, like a DeFi agent executing trades or on-chain activities, specific models built and trained for that purpose are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. Companies like Open Ledger allow the creation of specialized AI models tailored for particular needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The transition in the AI space has seen agents evolve from simple wrappers to using multiple specialized models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. For example, a question could be understood by an OpenAI model and then routed to a specialized math model for a more accurate answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Example: Move Programming Language Model
An example of a specialized model is one built on the Move programming language, a new and less popular language in Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. While a generic co-pilot like Cursor may not expertly understand Move, a specialized Move model (developed on Open Ledger) significantly outperforms it in benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This specialized model acts as the "brain" for a co-pilot agent, enabling it to:
*   Help programmers code better and more easily in Move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   Audit Move code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.
*   Analyze flaws in Move code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

This specialization provides better tools and infrastructure for building superior agents compared to generic models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. Although such models could be centralized, a decentralized approach that incentivizes data contribution is seen as more efficient for crowdsourcing the necessary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

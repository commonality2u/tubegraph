From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

Crypto trading, especially with leverage, presents significant [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges and risks]] that are often overlooked due to the public emphasis on financial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many people are drawn into the market believing they can replicate others' successes, often leading to substantial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Allure and Downfalls of Leverage Trading

Leverage trading allows individuals to trade with more money than they possess, magnifying both potential gains and losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Irene's Two-Month Experience

Irene Xiao's brief, less than two-month, journey into leverage trading saw her experience a full cycle of making a lot of money, losing it all, making it again, getting liquidated, and restarting multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Despite the rapid ups and downs, she continues, viewing it as a habit and a skill to master, rather than an addiction, with the goal of not losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. She has begun reading books and developing strategies like stop-losses to mitigate losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. She uses 20x leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> and allocates only 1% of her total funds for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, although this can increase if further funds are added to avoid liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### Host's Leverage Trading Story

The host recounts his experience with leverage trading in late 2019, aiming to increase his Bitcoin holdings without additional cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. He used BitMEX to trade coins with coins, hoping for a "double win" if Bitcoin's price also rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Aware that 90-99% of traders lose money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, he spent four months learning, even purchasing a course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

His initial strategy was to long Bitcoin at 2-3x leverage, believing a 50% price drop for liquidation was "almost impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. He started with 10% of his Bitcoin as collateral, planning to add more margin if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The idea was to close positions after 3% gains for a 9-10% profit and compound these gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

In December 2019, he made 30k in Bitcoin, exceeding his salary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Discovering ETH contracts on BitMEX, he shifted to ETH due to its higher volatility, making an additional 80k in the first week and another 80k in the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, during the COVID-19 crash, Ethereum dropped by approximately 70% in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Despite topping up his Bitcoin, funding fees exacerbated losses, leading to the loss of 80% of his net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Lessons Learned and Psychological Toll

Both individuals highlighted several key [[challenges_and_mistakes_in_crypto_investing | challenges and mistakes in crypto investing]] related to leverage trading:

*   **Risk of Liquidation:** Even with seemingly low leverage (2-3x), extreme market crashes can lead to total liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Higher leverage (20x) means even small price changes can cause significant portfolio drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Market Manipulation/Liquidation Events:** The market often experiences "liquidation events" (sharp price drops or spikes) specifically designed to liquidate both long and short positions, benefiting exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Ineffectiveness of Stop-Losses:** Stop-losses may not always work as intended during rapid drops, and sometimes a temporary crash might recover if enough margin is held, making timely exits difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Psychological Impact:** Trading is a 24/7 market that significantly impacts mental health, leading to constant checking, inability to sleep, and mental exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. The pressure to keep adding money to avoid liquidation is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Social Media Influence:** Social media often only showcases realized profits and unrealized gains, creating unrealistic expectations and encouraging people to enter the market without full understanding of the [[the_risks_and_strategies_for_capturing_crypto_market_gains | risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **The "Holy Grail" Illusion:** Many believe they have found a secret strategy or are smarter than others, leading to overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Superiority of Spot Holding:** Both agreed that simply buying and holding spot assets often outperforms active trading over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

### Effective Trading Strategies and Mindset

For those who do trade, key [[insights_on_crypto_trading_and_market_strategies | insights on crypto trading and market strategies]] include:

*   **Learning from Losses:** Successful traders have often experienced significant losses, forcing them to adjust strategies and develop a "gut feeling" rather than relying solely on indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Limiting Losses:** The most crucial strategy is to set stop-losses and pre-determine the maximum acceptable loss for any given trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   **Accepting Losses:** Overcoming the aversion to cutting losses is vital for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## Meme Coins: High Risk, High Reward

Meme coins represent another high-risk, high-reward area within crypto. Irene's interest led her down the "meme coin rabbit hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, where she found early "alpha" in Telegram and WeChat group chats rather than directly on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

### Examples of Meme Coin Trading

*   **Troll (TROLL):** After Elon Musk changed his Twitter profile to "Chief Troll Officer," some traders immediately bought the existing "Troll" token, making millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Irene bought it later and still achieved a 5x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Smiley (SMILEY):** Another Elon Musk-concept meme coin, this one yielded Irene a 10x (1,000%) return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   **Dog with Hat (WIF):** This token gained significant traction due to its "hat" concept, which some believe gives it a unique edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

### Meme Coin Strategy

Irene's strategy for meme coins is to focus on those associated with Elon Musk, as his mentions often drive significant price action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. She emphasizes that knowing **when to sell** is more important than when to buy, as delaying can lead to gains returning to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. She sells when a coin gains widespread discussion on platforms like Twitter, indicating it's likely too late to enter for maximum profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

## Bitcoin Ecosystem Developments (BRC-20 and Ordinals)

The Bitcoin ecosystem is undergoing significant developments beyond just being a store of value.

### BRC-20 and Ordinals Explained

BRC-20 refers to fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Ordinals are NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) inscribed directly onto individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. These developments are building a new ecosystem around Bitcoin, with projects focusing on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions to enhance security and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

### Chinese Influence and Bitcoin Halving

The BRC-20 and Ordinals trend is predominantly driven by Chinese investors and "Bitcoin Farmers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. These farmers aim to profit from increased transaction fees (gas fees) as more people trade within the Bitcoin ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

This surge in activity is also linked to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. Before the halving, which reduces the block reward for miners, there's an incentive to create new narratives and increase trading activity to generate more fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. Some speculate that Ordinals may become less popular after the halving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. While the narratives congest the network, causing frustration for "true bitcoiners," the opportunity for profit remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. The Western market is currently less engaged with Ordinals, suggesting potential for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

The crypto market moves incredibly fast, with significant price changes happening within months, making it challenging to keep up with every innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

Jordy Alexander, former pro poker player turned crypto genius and founder of Selini Capital, a successful market-making and venture capital firm, discusses his journey through personal challenges and how they shaped his approach to life and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Impact of Personal Hardships on Mental Health
Jordy Alexander experienced a turbulent path, which led to significant depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. His struggles with [[personal_hardships_and_mental_health | mental health]] stemmed from a volatile childhood, including inconsistent parenting, love, and frequent moves to different places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>. The move from the US to Cyprus at age 13 or 14 was particularly hard, derailing his life and taking 15 years to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:52">[01:42:52]</a>.

He noted that his mental state directly impacted his professional performance, especially in high-stakes environments like poker, where it's impossible to perform optimally when one's mental state is not good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>.

### Hitting Rock Bottom
At around 26 years old, after a significant breakup where his identity was tied to the relationship, Jordy experienced a deep depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. This led to a "negative spiral," akin to a crypto market liquidation, where his health deteriorated and his financial life suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. He found himself playing high-stakes poker games beyond his bankroll, making bad decisions driven by a "revenge trading" or "tilt" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.

A significant "rock bottom" moment was a near-fatal car crash at 2 AM, driven by anger and anxiety, which served as a desperate wake-up call to address his mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. He realized he needed a "helping hand" to pull himself out of the ditch, as he lacked the ability to generate enough positive thoughts on his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.

## The Role of Ego and Self-Development
Jordy discusses how even intelligent and analytical people struggle with [[personal_hardships_and_mental_health | mental health]] issues, as it's harder to logically dissect and solve internal emotional problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>. He learned to approach mental health systematically, a skill acquired from a decade in trading, which he lacked earlier in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

### Ego as a Defense Mechanism
He candidly acknowledges that his ego served as a defense mechanism, stemming from insecurity and overcompensating by being overconfident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:12">[01:45:12]</a>. Controlling the ego was a turning point, as he observed his life completely change once his ego was under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. The ego, tied to insecurities, is a defense mechanism built from tough life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:25">[01:29:25]</a>. Richard Whately's quote, "The ego is the single biggest obstruction to the achievement of anything," resonates strongly with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>. Social media exacerbates ego problems and anxiety, especially for young people trying to "show off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>.

### Individual Approach to [[Personal Growth and Recovery Experiences | Personal Growth]]
Jordy primarily pursued [[personal_growth_and_life_frameworks | self-development]] individually, without therapy, as he learned from a young age to handle difficulties alone due to his parents' divorce and his father's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:35">[01:26:35]</a>. He sees getting through excruciating difficulties by oneself as a powerful learning experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. This individual approach is a weakness to his detriment, but it has worked for him, though he occasionally considers an executive coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:34">[01:27:34]</a>.

He attributes his journey of self-discovery to understanding his "spirit animal" – a black dragon – which he interprets as not good or bad, but powerful, independent, and strong, offering a balance for his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:38">[01:35:38]</a>.

## [[Balancing high ambitions with mental health | Balancing Ambition and Well-being]]
Jordy's past involved destroying his health by not sleeping for five days straight to extract a million dollars from a trade, a sacrifice he felt compelled to make for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. This intensive period would leave him feeling awful and cause health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>. However, this year, he decided that his time and week are more important than the million dollars, marking a shift in his values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

He now values his time highly, expecting conversations to be worth at least $50,000 in terms of ideas or networking opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>.

### The Meaning of Life and Legacy
Jordy realized he wanted children after being confronted with the idea of not having them, understanding it as a fundamental part of his genes to procreate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:15">[01:31:15]</a>. His conclusion on the meaning of life is to "make the next generation better than us," providing a path for the future of humanity to evolve and eventually find meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:21">[01:33:21]</a>. This isn't about material wealth but about creating a better version of the previous generation, driving exponential growth into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### Finding Satisfaction in Progress
Jordy does not think about happiness in terms of chasing a specific number or title, but rather seeks the deeper satisfaction of achieving difficult things that have an impact on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>. This involves a micro view of [[personal_growth_and_recovery_experiences | progress]], focusing on what is achieved daily, weekly, or monthly, rather than fixed goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>.

He believes making too much money too quickly can "mess with your mind completely," leading to a loss of touch with reality and a lack of self-worth or entrepreneurial drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:40">[01:42:40]</a>. He prefers a continuous journey of [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | growth]] and progression, constantly getting better, rather than retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

### Advice to his Younger Self
Jordy would advise his 19-year-old self to focus on [[the_role_of_selfdevelopment_and_mindset_in_achieving_goals | deconstructing the ego]] and accepting "being nothing" at a low level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. He would encourage humility and building a solid foundation step by step, rather than trying to get ahead by showing off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>.

He emphasizes playing the "game of life" with oneself, focusing on being better today than yesterday, rather than constantly comparing oneself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. He also highlights the importance of aligning the "Observer" self with actions and reality, as external "noise" or internal narratives can hinder a fulfilled life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>. Ultimately, to gain respect, resources, and achieve things, one must improve oneself and make oneself better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:39">[01:34:39]</a>.

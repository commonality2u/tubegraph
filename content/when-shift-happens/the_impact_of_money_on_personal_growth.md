Hasib Kureshi, Managing Partner at Dragonfly, a global crypto-focused investment fund, shares insights from his varied career, particularly focusing on the profound impact money has had on his personal growth and pursuit of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. His journey, from professional poker player to venture capitalist, highlights the complex relationship between financial success and [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | personal growth]].

## The Illusion of Money and Happiness

### Early Experiences with Poker Money
Kureshi began playing poker professionally at 17, quickly earning a substantial income, including over a million dollars by age 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Despite this financial success, he quickly realized that the popular perception of money bringing glamour and an idealized lifestyle was "complete bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. He observed many young, wealthy poker players who were "miserable," acquiring luxury items like Lamborghinis and expensive accessories, only to find "nobody cares" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. He learned that buying status symbols felt "empty" if there was no genuine enjoyment or meaning attached to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

### Research on Money and Happiness
Kureshi states that [[the_pursuit_of_success_and_its_impact_on_happiness | money does not make people happy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. He cites research showing that beyond a basic level of material wealth, happiness "falls off logarithmically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. For someone in a middle-class, first-world country, while money solves "money problems," one does not need a million dollars to achieve this; around $50,000 to $100,000 a year is often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. Kureshi personally found his happiness didn't significantly change when his income dropped from over a million dollars as a poker player to just over $100,000 as a software engineer in the Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. True happiness, he concludes, comes from "other people, it's connection, it's human beings, it's family, it's friends, it's the experiences that you fill your life with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

## Redefining Success and Personal Growth

### The Decision to Quit Poker and Give Away Money
A pivotal moment in Kureshi's life was quitting poker and intentionally giving away a significant portion of his wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. This decision was spurred by a "chaotic period" where his reputation was damaged after defending a friend who cheated others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, coupled with his growing disillusionment with poker as a life path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. He feared a second chapter of his life feeling insignificant compared to his early poker success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.

To force himself to "reinvent" his life, he deliberately removed his financial "cushion," leaving himself with only $10,000, and starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. He donated part of his money and gave another part to his parents for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. This act of [[personal_growth_through_adversity | personal growth through adversity]] allowed him to pursue a new path, eventually leading him into the tech industry in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.

### Overcoming Imposter Syndrome
Kureshi identifies with the feeling of [[financial_and_personal_growth_overcoming_challenges_and_learning_from_mistakes | imposter syndrome]], especially after making significant money quickly in poker and then transitioning to venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. He believes that if one doesn't experience imposter syndrome, they might lack the self-reflection to understand the "insanity" of their situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. He deals with it by acknowledging the feeling and doing the work anyway, as there is "no choice but to get through it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. As an investor, he realized he possessed "magic powers" due to being outside the internal structure of a company, enabling him to offer unbiased, impactful advice to founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. This external perspective allows him to see obvious problems that internal teams or even founders might miss, and his advice often "lands" in a significant way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. This ability, though initially contributing to imposter syndrome, became a "superpower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

### The Value of "Unstructured Learning" and Starting from Scratch
Kureshi's "superpower" is "unstructured learning," which applies when there is no clear course or textbook for a skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He experienced this first in poker, where he had to gather bits and pieces of information, experiment, take risks, fail, and iterate to become world-class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>. He argues that formal schooling (structured learning) often doesn't prepare individuals for "real jobs" that lack textbooks or clear paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

Similarly, early crypto, six or seven years ago, was a field of unstructured learning, with very few resources available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:53">[02:21:53]</a>. This type of learning, requiring immersion and creating one's own curriculum, is "almost always the most valuable learning in the world" and "what gets most rewarded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. He describes both poker and crypto as "chaotic and very creative" new frontiers that aren't merely IQ tests but require "risk appetite," "creativity," and the ability to "integrate a lot of different things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

## The Psychological Health of Different Careers

### Poker vs. Venture Capital
Kureshi contrasts poker and venture capital in terms of [[mental_health_and_personal_development | psychological health]]. Poker, with its high volatility, emotional wear and tear, rough hours, and often unhealthy lifestyle (casinos, poor eating, degenerate environment), was a "psychologically unhealthy place for young men to build a find meaning and build an identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. It often resulted in a "zero-sum" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.

In contrast, venture capital, particularly in crypto, is "quintessentially positive sum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. In venture, the goal is to "find great people and you're helping them succeed," meaning "the only reason why you'll win is that these people and their teams and their products become successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. This collaborative, "team sport" approach, unlike many "single player games" in crypto, is a "beautiful way of transforming work... into a multiplayer game" and is "the most psychologically healthy way" to approach a disruptive industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Adding Value and Building Reputation
Kureshi advises aspiring crypto professionals to "start writing and talking in public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, even if they feel they have nothing original to say. Teaching those slightly behind you in their learning journey is a powerful way to add value, build an audience, and begin the flywheel of [[building_a_personal_brand_and_its_impact | building a name for yourself]] and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This approach highlights that sustained influence and [[the_impact_and_importance_of_personal_branding_in_finance_and_crypto | personal branding]] in crypto aren't built by superficial self-promotion or chasing vanity metrics like social media followers, but by consistently "adding value to everybody you meet, to every interaction you have, to every project that you work with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. This is a much harder path, as most people are "takers," not "givers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>. This mindset aligns with [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | an entrepreneurial approach]]: identifying your strengths and applying them where they can add the most value, rather than trying to imitate others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.

## Conclusion
Hasib Kureshi's journey underscores that while money can solve financial problems, it does not inherently lead to happiness or [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | personal growth]]. Instead, genuine satisfaction and meaning are found through connection with others, continually learning and growing, and contributing value to the world around you. His experience shows that intentional financial decisions, even giving away wealth, can be powerful catalysts for profound [[personal_growth_through_adversity | personal development]].

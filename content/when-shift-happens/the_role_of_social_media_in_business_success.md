Social media has played a significant role in the success of the streetwear brand Black Paris, which Julian, its founder and chief designer, describes as revolutionary for its distinctive all-black aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Julian emphasizes that social media was instrumental in Black's success, highlighting its profound impact from the brand's inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">[01:41:14]</a>.

## Initial Growth and Visibility

Black Paris was born during a dark period in Julian's life, a time when he found creativity in sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. The brand started as a concept on Instagram, where Julian, as a designer, posted "all black everything" designs, such as a Starbucks in black or a McDonald's in black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. This concept went viral and garnered significant public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. He then acquired the "black" handle on Instagram to further develop this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

Social media was the primary channel for finding customers, understanding their preferences, and identifying target markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:37">[01:41:37]</a>. The brand's presence in the Asian market (Taiwan, Japan, Macau) and the US (New York, Santa Clara) was largely due to its strong social media marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>. Initially, Black was a social brand before evolving into a fashion brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>.

## Market Insight and Product Development

Julian utilizes social media not just for visibility but as a data-driven tool for market insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:19">[01:43:19]</a>. He tests product ideas on Instagram, such as black MacBook skins or a black cards game, before committing to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. This allows him to confirm hypotheses about customer demand, ensuring that investments in new products are well-founded rather than speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:05">[01:44:05]</a>.

This approach reflects his background in business engineering, where he leverages data to understand what products customers want, how to sell them, and how to communicate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:22">[01:42:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:23">[01:43:23]</a>. He notes that while some established fashion brands might not rely heavily on social media, for newer brands like Black, it is crucial for establishing legitimacy and overperforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.

## Building Brand Legitimacy

Social media followers act as a significant "vanity metric" for new businesses, influencing public perception of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. Black Paris has 1.4 million followers, which helps to legitimize the brand in the eyes of new customers who might not have heard of it before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. This external validation is a key part of the "game" of the fashion industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:26">[02:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:04">[02:11:04]</a>.

The strategy initially involved projecting an image of being a large and mysterious brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>. This "fake it to remake it" approach helped build momentum, although Julian admits that early sales were often break-even due to high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:10">[01:50:10]</a>. Despite the financial realities, the projected image on social media contributed to [[building_a_brand_and_media_business | building a brand]] and perception of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:46">[01:50:46]</a>.

## The Founder's Personal Social Media Approach

Julian maintains a mysterious vibe on his personal social media, aligning with Black's romantic luxury aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>. He uses his personal accounts primarily for business and content creation, avoiding personal posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>. He admits that showing off wealth on Instagram can feel inauthentic and against his personal values, but he does it to be credible in the eyes of others, as it's part of the industry's expectation for a "successful guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:26">[02:51:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:26">[02:51:26]</a>.

He acknowledges that his reliance on social media for personal validation and engagement led to periods of depression, prompting him to reduce his personal activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. Now, he focuses on the business account, which is less about his personal face and more about the brand itself, leading to improved mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. This highlights the double-edged sword of [[influence_and_monetization_through_social_media | social media influence]].

## Strategic Adaptation and Long-Term View

Black is a profitable business with a valuation between $80 million and $100 million, and it has achieved this without external investors, relying solely on family ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>. This allows Julian to pursue a founder-led, long-term vision without short-term external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>.

The brand continues to innovate using [[digital_marketing_strategies_in_the_era_of_social_media_and_crypto | digital marketing strategies]], venturing into the crypto space with NFTs. Julian created the artworks for the Dark Mode NFT series himself, which introduced Black Paris to the NFT community and sold out on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The Black Genesis collection, linked to the core business, offers holders benefits like store discounts and event invitations, creating a membership model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>. The brand's audience, particularly gamers, connects well with the crypto and NFT space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>. Black Paris has also secured a dual Web2 and Web3 collaboration with PSG, leveraging their shared Parisian roots and aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:14">[02:13:14]</a>. The [[influence_of_social_media_platforms_on_the_crypto_space | influence of social media platforms on the crypto space]] is evident in this venture.

Ultimately, social media, alongside a deep understanding of market data and a strong personal drive, remains a critical tool for Black's continued growth and expansion into diverse lifestyle sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and creator of Polkadot, has a personal journey marked by a challenging childhood, academic pursuits, and a unique approach to life and innovation.

## Early Life and Childhood Hardships

Gavin Wood describes his childhood as "wasn't the easiest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. He grew up with a [[personal_hardships_and_mental_health | single parent]], his mother, who had an abusive husband that was also his father for a number of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. While he doesn't recall being physically abused, he has strong memories of "essentially abandonment" from that era of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. These experiences fostered a "strong gratitude for a safe environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>. He acknowledges that he can "probably identify with [[personal_hardships_and_mental_health | childhood trauma]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>, and this period of his life has deeply impacted his thinking and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:24">[01:33:24]</a>. Despite discussing these formative experiences, he has not undergone specific psychotherapy or hypnotism for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.

## Academic Pursuits and Early Career

Gavin Wood's [[career_journey_from_musician_to_entrepreneurship | career journey]] began with a mashup of music and computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>. He pursued a PhD in music visualization because of his love for music and his naturally analytical mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:14">[03:16:14]</a>. He was interested in "musical analytics," where music breaks down into structure and pattern, such as verse-chorus structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:53">[03:43:53]</a>. His goal was to create algorithmic ways to transform audio into familiar, tangible visual representations, enabling people to understand music structure better and have a more immersive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:54">[04:27:54]</a>. His PhD work led to an innovation used in modern DJ software, where waveforms are colored to help comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

After his PhD, he did not continue in the music industry due to his dislike for the entrepreneurial aspects of meetings and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:08">[04:55:08]</a>. Instead, he briefly worked in the video games industry, trying to make a sequel to a beloved childhood game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:40">[04:59:40]</a>. This stint was short-lived, and he then returned to finish his PhD corrections and contemplate his next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.

## Financial Situation and Entry into Crypto

Before his involvement with Ethereum, Wood faced significant [[financial_and_personal_growth_overcoming_challenges_and_learning_from_mistakes | financial challenges]]. By December 2013, he had only £500 left, which was his monthly rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:27">[02:41:27]</a>. Having already attempted two unsuccessful startups, he considered getting a job at a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, a friend named Johnny Bitcoin offered him £1,000 a month to continue working on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This support allowed him to continue coding the Ethereum white paper, leading to him becoming a co-founder a few months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. He eventually repaid Johnny Bitcoin 5,000 ETH after Ethereum launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:29">[02:42:29]</a>.

He first learned about Bitcoin in 2011 from a Slashdot article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:39">[04:53:39]</a> but couldn't be bothered with the identity checks to buy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:18">[05:00:18]</a>. He revisited crypto in early 2013 after reading an article about Bitcoin and its developer, Mii Alisi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:37">[05:07:37]</a>. His curiosity, combined with shared backgrounds in C++ and video game coding, led him to meet Mii Alisi and other Bitcoin personalities in a South London squat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:35">[05:15:35]</a>. Through these connections, he was introduced to Vitalik Buterin and received the Ethereum white paper in early December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:57">[05:40:57]</a>. His analytical nature and curiosity compelled him to start coding it to see if it would work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:20">[05:42:20]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Values

Wood values [[personal_growth_and_life_frameworks | curiosity and freedom]] over money, having consistently chosen intellectually stimulating work over higher-paying opportunities, even when facing financial precarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:59">[02:42:59]</a>. He believes money cannot buy love, time, or true health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:44">[02:43:44]</a>. He identifies as a "free spirit" and avoids pigeonholing himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:10">[08:14:10]</a>. His mission includes finding [[personal_growth_and_life_frameworks | happiness]] and contentment, being a good father, and fulfilling a sense of duty towards his past involvement in projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:07">[09:42:07]</a>. He also holds "childhood ambitions" related to art and music that he believes will bring him and others happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:04">[10:10:04]</a>.

He resigned from his CEO role at Parity Technologies in 2022 to "refocus" on intellectual discourse, ideation, and development, as the stress of running a company inhibited this kind of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:41">[02:29:41]</a>. He views this decision as very positive for his own [[personal_growth_and_life_frameworks | happiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:16">[02:32:16]</a>. He aims to cut down on travel to improve his lifestyle and optimize his happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:23">[02:33:23]</a>.

Regarding the meaning of life, Wood believes it's a personal opinion, not necessarily knowable or requiring rationalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:31">[02:34:31]</a>. His driving force is to "pick principles that seem to be worthwhile and contribute to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:04">[02:35:04]</a>. He aspires to build a university if he acquires the resources, seeing it as a way of bolstering education and "human understanding of the world" and "the passing on of human knowledge," aligning with the Enlightenment ideal of improved human knowledge leading to a better human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:20">[02:36:20]</a>.

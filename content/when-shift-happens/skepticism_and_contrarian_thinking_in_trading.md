Joe McCann, founder, CEO, and CIO at Asymmetric, emphasizes the critical role of skepticism and contrarian thinking for success in trading and entrepreneurship. He believes these traits allow individuals to identify opportunities overlooked by the majority and avoid blindly following conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>.

## The Core Philosophy: Think for Yourself

McCann argues that individuals should "think for yourself" rather than seeking comfort in consistency, tradition, or being told what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56]">[00:28:56]</a>. Independent thinkers, especially those with an "anti-establishment" or contrarian view, are often the ones who change the world and lead others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17]">[00:29:17]</a>. Blindly following others is not generally positive for society and lacks critical and independent thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59]">[00:29:59]</a>. This critical thinking, ideally fostered from childhood, helps individuals break free from conditioning and explore new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08]">[00:31:08]</a>.

## Benefits of Skepticism

By constantly questioning things, one can "unpack Alpha" that was previously unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48]">[01:28:48]</a>. A healthy dose of skepticism informs one's view, enabling the identification of opportunities missed by those who follow the herd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36]">[01:29:36]</a>. This approach is not about being contrarian for its own sake, but rather about thinking from [[importance_of_firstprinciple_thinking_in_investments | first principles]] and broadly recognizing patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51]">[00:23:51]</a>.

## Challenging Conventional Wisdom

McCann highlights several areas where conventional wisdom falls short:

*   **Price Targets**: He views price targets as "nonsense" invented by Wall Street to sell products, making for easy headlines but providing meaningless information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51]">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Traditional Models in Crypto**: Applying models from traditional finance, such as price-to-earnings ratios, to crypto is ineffective because crypto operates on an "entirely new set of principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41]">[00:22:41]</a>. Instead, one should start from [[importance_of_firstprinciple_thinking_in_investments | first principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09]">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   **Learning to Trade/Invest**: McCann asserts that one cannot learn to trade or run a business from books, classes, or textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10]">[01:05:10]</a>. Trading is "very emotional" and requires direct experience and "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38]">[01:06:38]</a>. Similarly, starting a business is the best way to learn to run one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51]">[01:05:51]</a>. He cautions against online courses and YouTube videos that promise easy buttons to becoming a trader, as their incentive models are based on advertising and page views, not genuine education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48]">[01:07:48]</a>.

## Application in Trading

### Trading Against Emotions
One of the most crucial aspects of contrarian thinking in trading is the ability to master one's emotions and go against gut feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12]">[01:15:12]</a>. When markets experience significant events, such as a "VAR shock" (Value at Risk shock) leading to panic, opportunities arise for those who are not panicking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52]">[01:15:52]</a>. While natural to feel anxiety, experienced traders learn to detach their mental framework from emotion to recognize that moments of panic are often indicative of a market bottom, encouraging buying rather than selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39]">[01:16:39]</a>. This also applies to euphoric moments at market tops, where one should consider taking profits instead of chasing further gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35]">[01:17:35]</a>. This counter-intuitive approach is why few are successful traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22]">[01:25:22]</a>.

### Understanding Loss Aversion
A significant challenge for traders is [[the_psychology_behind_crypto_investments | loss aversion]], the human tendency to hate losing more than enjoying winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17]">[01:19:17]</a>. This often leads investors to justify staying in losing positions, rationalizing why an asset's price decline is temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20]">[01:21:20]</a>. McCann emphasizes that "the price is the only thing that matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38]">[01:21:38]</a>. He states, "there's nothing wrong with being wrong, staying wrong is a sin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44]">[01:21:44]</a>.

### Knowing Your Exit Strategy
To overcome loss aversion, it is crucial to have an exit strategy *before* entering a trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10]">[01:20:10]</a>. This removes emotion from the decision-making process. For instance, setting a pre-determined stop-loss level and a profit-taking level means that when the price hits these points, the action is taken without emotional justification, preventing emotional mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14]">[01:22:14]</a>.

### Embracing Volatility
McCann's upbringing, characterized by frequent moves and a "consistent state of destabilization," cultivated a high degree of adaptability and comfort with [[the_psychology_and_strategies_of_handling_investment_volatility | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00]">[01:19:00]</a>. He distinguishes between "volatility" and "chaos," thriving in the former where there are still constraints, but not in the latter, which is difficult to define and manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:48]">[01:19:48]</a>. For him, the highly volatile crypto market is "perfectly primed" for his trading style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35]">[01:37:35]</a>.

## Personal Background and Skepticism

Growing up with a single mother and three brothers, frequently moving, instilled a "healthy dose of questioning authority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08]">[01:28:08]</a>. This background, including dealing with [[mental_health_challenges_in_highstakes_trading | chronic insomnia]] and finding effective [[mental_health_challenges_in_highstakes_trading | therapy]], also shaped his skeptical view of systems, such as the medical system. He discovered that without insurance, he could negotiate a 91% discount on knee surgery, leading him to question the incentives of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, which he believes are designed to keep people sick rather than healing them due to their business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17]">[01:32:17]</a>. Understanding the business model and incentives of every actor is key to clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03]">[01:03:03]</a>.

This blend of personal experience, philosophical study, and a deep understanding of incentives forms the bedrock of McCann's skeptical and contrarian approach, which he attributes to Asymmetric's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17]">[00:29:17]</a>.

High-frequency trading (HFT) is a critical component of modern financial markets, utilizing advanced technology to automate market-making functions and improve overall market efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## What is High-Frequency Trading?
HFT is the practice of employing computers to automate all aspects of market-making functionality that were historically performed by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It centers on the concept of using machines to create consistent markets at all times when an exchange is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This automation is analogous to how machine-made products, like toilet paper, are significantly cheaper than those produced by hand, due to increased efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Importance in Financial Markets
The primary benefit of HFT lies in its ability to generate significant market efficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. When humans are solely responsible for market-making, spreads tend to be wide because they cannot price assets with extreme precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. They also have a "fudge factor" in pricing and slower reaction times to new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

HFT, through the use of computers, leads to:
*   **Tighter Spreads** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>
*   **Better Liquidity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>
*   **Cheaper Cost of Trading and Investing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>

This ultimately benefits end-users by reducing their costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## HFT in Crypto Markets
While HFT thrives in traditional financial markets like NASDAQ or CME, the crypto space presents varying levels of efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

The efficiency hierarchy is observed as:
1.  **Highest Efficiency:** Traditional centralized markets (e.g., NASDAQ, CME) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
2.  **Medium Efficiency:** Centralized exchanges trading crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
3.  **Least Efficient:** [[The development of decentralized trading networks | Decentralized exchanges]] trading crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The inefficiency in [[The development of decentralized trading networks | decentralized exchanges]] results in higher costs for end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This inefficiency is primarily due to non-performant technology and higher individual transaction costs for market maker orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Higher costs limit how frequently market makers can update their quotes, leading to less precise pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Monad's Approach to Efficiency
Companies like Monad Labs are aiming to address these inefficiencies in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Monad, a parallel [[Ethereums role and infrastructure in financial markets | EVM]] layer 1 blockchain, offers 1000x the throughput of [[Ethereums role and infrastructure in financial markets | Ethereum]] to help decentralized applications achieve world-scale adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It provides "the best of both worlds" for developers, enabling much cheaper transactions and allowing apps to scale to world adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Monad's unique approach involves introducing parallelism to the [[Ethereums role and infrastructure in financial markets | EVM]] and other performance re-architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This is critical because current [[Ethereums role and infrastructure in financial markets | EVM]] layer ones cannot handle the transaction volume required for mass adoption (e.g., an app with a million daily active users could generate 50 million transactions per day, or 500 transactions per second, which would saturate any existing [[Ethereums role and infrastructure in financial markets | EVM]] blockchain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Monad aims for 10,000 TPS (transactions per second), or a billion transactions per day, to support such scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

A major bottleneck identified in blockchain performance, particularly for [[Ethereums role and infrastructure in financial markets | Ethereum]], is state access, where transaction processing requires looking up and modifying data stored on solid-state drives (SSDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Monad's architecture is designed to make this more performant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.# The Significance of High-Frequency Trading in Financial Markets

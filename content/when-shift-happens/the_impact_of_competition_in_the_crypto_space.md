## Universal Competition

In the world of tokens, every entity is a form of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This environment is characterized by constant rivalry, where projects are not only striving for collective growth but also vying for their share of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. It's a landscape of both [[evolution_and_competition_among_blockchain_ecosystems | ultimate player-versus-player (PVP)]] and peer-to-peer (PPP) interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. When a competitor performs exceptionally well, it provides an opportunity for others to learn and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

## Navigating the Competitive Landscape

### A Founder's Perspective

For founders, competition brings significant stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. The emergence of new competitors or features can force a re-evaluation of existing plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

Meow, co-founder of Jupiter, describes his approach to competition as "schizophrenic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Paranoia**: Initially, a period of intense fear and a sense of impending failure, driving a frantic effort to cover all bases and analyze the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
2.  **Acceptance**: Realizing that competition is ultimately beneficial as it encourages improvement and provides learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
3.  **Happiness/Blissfulness**: Recognizing that the space benefits from new, interesting developments, and one can learn from and coexist with strong competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

This cycle of paranoia to acceptance to happiness can recur monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.

### Strategic Approaches to Competition

Projects must embrace a "flywheel" mentality where community, revenue, and product mutually reinforce each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Success is achieved by ensuring that the community is rewarded for its participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

The product itself serves as marketing for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. For example, Pudgy Penguins' toys are a product that markets to its community, rather than the toy business being the end goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Similarly, Jupiter's excellent product aims to attract and build its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Case Study: Base and Abstract

The NFT space has seen intense competition, with a general feeling that the tide needs to be lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. In the Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem on Ethereum, Base is seen as a dominant force, executing exceptionally well and setting a high standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

### Base's Strengths and Handicaps

*   **Operational Excellence**: Base is considered the highest-executing chain, consistently shipping new features, content, and campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This reflects "operational excellence in its final form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Affiliation**: While Base's success is partly due to its strong execution, some also attribute it to its connection with Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.
*   **Handicaps**: Despite its strengths, Base faces challenges:
    *   **Crypto Native Appeal**: It may struggle to appeal to crypto natives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.
    *   **International Adoption**: As Coinbase is primarily an American exchange, international adoption for Base tokens might be difficult, limiting the ecosystem's potential to thrive if tokens cannot be listed on major global exchanges like Binance or OKX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

If Base were a token today, it is believed it would be a top three chain token, alongside Solana and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

### Differentiating Through Consumer Focus

Abstract, an Ethereum Layer 2, aims to fill a gap in the EVM ecosystem by hyper-focusing on the consumer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. Unlike general-purpose chains that optimize for DeFi or payments, Abstract prioritizes fun and virality, aspiring to be "crypto's digital Disneyland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. This means putting the user above all else, which is an unorthodox approach for most chains that prioritize decentralization or block integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

> "I want to be the ecosystem for fun and virality and once I have 5 million monthly active users I can upsell them on the new great DeFi Innovation but I don't want to pivot my focus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>

## The Dual Nature of Competition

While competition is fierce, it is also seen as a "worthy competition" that ultimately benefits the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Learning from competitors and coexisting with successful projects are key aspects of navigating the competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

> [Meow] "Every time someone comes in here and do something really well I I think I I like it I like wow I can learn something here that isn't that many people learn from right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>

Ultimately, [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_crypto | competition drives innovation]] and forces projects to continuously improve, fostering a dynamic and evolving ecosystem.

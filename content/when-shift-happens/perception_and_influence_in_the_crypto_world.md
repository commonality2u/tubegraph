Hasib Kureshi, a managing partner at Dragonfly, a global crypto-focused investment fund, and co-host of The Chopping Block podcast, shares insights on navigating perception and influence within the cryptocurrency industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## The Role of Perception in Venture Capital

In venture capital, Kureshi notes that junior investors often struggle to understand businesses and technology, requiring training and studying the history of both to build mental frameworks for prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, understanding people is deeply ingrained in human brains, and gut feelings about trustworthiness are often accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Junior VCs may dismiss their instincts, being swayed by credentials, impressive presentations, and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. In contrast, experienced VCs learn to trust their initial perceptions of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. This reliance on instinct is supported by social psychology's "stereotype accuracy," a robust finding that humans are well-attuned to correctly detecting common differences based on direct experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. As a VC, he advises against fighting against these initial perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

Kureshi emphasizes that a key principle for success in crypto is to "start writing and talking in public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. He advises against waiting until you feel you have unique ideas or sufficient knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. Even if your initial work is "embarrassing" or "dumb," there are always people a few steps behind you in their learning who can benefit from what you've just learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. Starting early allows for improvement without significant criticism, as "no one cares anyway" at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. This process of adding value, even to a small audience, builds a name, connections, and notoriety within the internet-based crypto society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.

### Followers vs. Real Influence
Kureshi discusses the "burson paradox" or "the tails come apart," where initial correlations, like followers and influence, diverge at extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>. Accounts with millions of followers are often good entertainers who produce content but lack the ability to "control anything" or make things happen in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. Conversely, some individuals with fewer followers hold significant influence, capable of shifting the world with their posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>. This demonstrates that influence is not always "legible on social media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>, mirroring how "wealth tends to speak very quietly, whereas rich people tend to be loud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>. Beyond a certain point, gaining more followers has little impact on real influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>. The true path to influence is not self-promotion or name-dropping, but by consistently adding value to every interaction, project, and person you meet, which builds your reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.

## [[media_influence_and_ethical_considerations_in_crypto_promotion | Managing Public Perception in Crypto]]

The crypto industry experiences rapid shifts in public perception. An individual can quickly go from being perceived as a "cool hipster" to a "rockstar" and then to a "scammer" by the same people within a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:15">[01:26:15]</a>. Kureshi notes that his affiliation with effective altruism, which was "cool" during FTX's reign but became "cringiest" after its collapse, illustrates this volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>.

As a VC, public perception directly impacts business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>. Kureshi's strategy for managing this is to "be more transparent, say what you really think, and add value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>. He acknowledges that expressing strong opinions may anger some communities, but states that if you're not "poked the hornet's nest every once in a while," you're not doing enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>. Despite public backlash, the crypto community often has a "very short memory," allowing individuals to move past controversies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>.

## [[role_of_media_and_misinterpretation_in_cryptocurrency | The Perception of Crypto Itself]]

Kureshi believes that crypto is inherently "subversive" and challenges state power, unlike most technologies that primarily strengthen the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:18">[01:56:18]</a>. He explains that crypto exists as a response to constraints introduced by governments, such as control over monetary policy and capital flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:57">[01:56:57]</a>. This contrasts with technologies like the internet or AI, which enhance state surveillance and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a>. Crypto, he argues, is "for people and not for states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>.

The collapse of FTX highlighted the distinction between centralized businesses and the core values of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:11">[01:27:11]</a>. Kureshi maintains that FTX's fraud, being a centralized business, does not change his conviction in crypto, which is about self-custody, self-sovereignty, and programmable moneyâ€”principles directly opposed to trusting third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:42">[01:48:42]</a>. He views crypto at its core as a philosophy about how money and value should be oriented, independent of specific political events or individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:59">[01:52:59]</a>.

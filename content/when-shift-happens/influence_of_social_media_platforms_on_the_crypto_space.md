Our guest today is Irene Zhao, a Chinese model and influencer, recognized as one of the most influential women in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. She is also the founder of So-Col, a Web3 social platform for creators, brands, and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Early Influencer Journey: Instagram
Irene Zhao's influencer journey began after university, which she considers "pretty late" compared to most influencers who start around 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Her career as an influencer and a broker started simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. While doing part-time modeling in university, she posted random photos on Instagram, some of which went viral, leading to sponsorship offers from brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Her first paid gig was an advertisement for a coconut drink, earning $80 for a single post when she had about 2,000 to 3,000 followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

She quickly learned to analyze what content attracted more followers and focused on posting in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This content often involved portraying a "cute, innocent, girl next door" persona, which was different from her real-life personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. At her peak, she could gain 10,000 followers from a single post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Consistency was key, requiring her to post almost daily for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

#### Challenges of the Instagram Influencer Game
Irene found the Instagram influencer game stressful due to the need to maintain a "fake persona" that didn't reflect her true personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. There was also pressure to post more "exposing" or "revealing" photos to gain attention, which she disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Another struggle was taking sponsorships for products that didn't align with her personal branding, diluting her image for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

She notes that while some influencers make a decent living, it depends on managing their brand well and working with high-end brands, as well as their followers' purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Many influencers share extensive details of their lives, including relationships and family, to connect with a predominantly female audience who value such content (e.g., makeup tutorials, fashion tips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. However, income can be limited if one remains solely dependent on brand sponsorships, suggesting that building one's own brand or products offers more financial control and potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

### Transition to Crypto Twitter
Irene entered the crypto space in early 2021 as the CMO of a DeFi project, where her friends, who were also her university friends, asked her to apply her existing marketing skills to promote their product on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Twitter is considered an indispensable platform for individuals and projects in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

Her personal Twitter account quickly gained traction, reaching 100,000 followers within half a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. This rapid growth was attributed to the scarcity of women in crypto at the time and the fact that some of her Instagram followers were already big KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) on Twitter, who interacted with her content, boosting its visibility through the Twitter algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

#### The Crypto Twitter Game
The "Twitter game" is distinct from other social media platforms. It requires constant engagement to stay updated on jokes, memes, and current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. Crypto enthusiasts are perceived as "very smart" and "much less tolerant" of unfunny jokes or "cringe" content, demanding intelligence in tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. Irene had to spend two to three hours daily just to keep up with the latest trends and link them back to crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

The move to Twitter also created a conflict in her online persona; her Instagram was lifestyle-focused (gym, yoga, brunch), while her Twitter was professional crypto content (DeFi, tokens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. This led to accusations of being "fake" and negative comments from her original Instagram audience, who preferred her lifestyle content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. As a result, she reduced lifestyle posts on Instagram, focusing on more neutral "entrepreneurship" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

### From DeFi to NFTs and So-Col
Despite her role as a CMO for a DeFi project, Irene admits she doesn't particularly enjoy DeFi, finding it unsuitable and hard to understand for mainstream audiences, especially women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. Her pivot into NFTs was sparked when a friend sent her a CryptoPunk for free in July 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. Observing its price increase, she realized the potential of NFTs as a business model for creators, allowing any content (videos, dances, music) to be tokenized and owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. NFTs felt more relevant than fungible tokens because of their diverse formats and applications for various creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

Her "lightbulb moment" came from wanting to do something more with her existing large audience beyond advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. She envisioned using NFTs to create gated communities, offering exclusive content and an "Inner Circle" to her fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. This led to the launch of the **IrinDAO** NFT collection, which was a free mint for fans and started as a social experiment and a meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

The IrinDAO collection minted out in 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. Its virality was partly due to its ridiculous, badly cropped image, which made it funny and spread as a meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. It gained significant attention when she sent one to "mcnugrats," a crypto KOL who posted about it, leading to Logan Paul purchasing 29 NFTs, causing the floor price to surge to 5 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>. This event cemented her reputation as the first successful creator to launch an NFT in the crypto space, inspiring the "synth movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.

The experience of IrinDAO highlighted the complexities of launching NFTs (smart contract developers, OpenSea, Discord, Snapshot for DAO votes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. This led to the founding of So-Col (Social Collectible), a platform designed to simplify NFT creation for creators, allowing them to launch their own collections "at the click of a button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.

#### So-Col and the Future of Creator Economy
So-Col aims to empower creators by allowing them to own their content and community, unlike centralized platforms like Instagram or Twitter that can remove content or accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. By selling NFTs, creators build a special relationship with fans who become co-owners of the content, fostering a powerful community that benefits from the creator's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. This also enables financial incentives for fans to evangelize their favorite creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

Despite the appeal, So-Col faces significant challenges, particularly the ongoing crypto bear market and the public's negative perception of NFTs (viewed as scams or environmentally unfriendly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. Educating potential users remains a high barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. For example, K-Pop fans are strongly against NFTs and their idols engaging in the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

To adapt, So-Col has pivoted to a B2B model alongside its B2C efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. Many large companies still believe in the future of NFTs and are willing to invest resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. So-Col works with brands like Amber Lounge (F1 party organizer) to create lifelong NFT memberships with exclusive privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>, and Nothing (a phone brand) to air-drop NFTs that can be redeemed for physical gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

### Life as a Crypto Entrepreneur
Transitioning from influencer to entrepreneur has changed Irene's life significantly. She no longer worries about Instagram likes or brand rejections, and can post content she genuinely enjoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. However, she now faces concerns about investors, retail users, and managing numerous projects and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>.

Fundraising for So-Col was challenging initially due to the nascent "SocialFi" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. They secured their first investment from Animoca Brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. After IrinDAO's viral success, it became much easier to raise capital, and their seed round was oversubscribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. However, after events like the collapse of Terra/Luna and FTX, the "real crypto winter" began, making investors much more cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Raising money with tokens can be easier for Web3-native VCs, but building a decentralized application (dApp) is harder than building infrastructure (Layer 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

Flexibility is crucial in the crypto industry due to rapidly changing narratives (e.g., Bitcoin NFTs, [[Meme Coins and Social Media Influence]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. However, it's also important to stay firm on one's core thesis and build consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. The bear market is seen as a good time to build without the distraction of "noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.

The crypto world is characterized by extreme volatility and rapid changes, such as meme coins surging and collapsing, or major exchanges like FTX failing within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. To deal with the mental health challenges of this "emotional roller coaster," Irene emphasizes acceptance: accepting market conditions, setbacks, and the current limitations of NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. It's crucial to ignore the "noise" and avoid comparing oneself to others who often exaggerate their successes online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.

After launching So-Col's token, Irene notes that investors are understanding of the bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. The main challenge is that token price often becomes the sole metric of a project's success, regardless of underlying development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. She is learning to cope with negative comments from users who blame the team for price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>.

Irene's advice to others is to ignore the noise and focus on one's own path, constantly striving to be better than yesterday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. She believes that "shortcut is actually the longest way to success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. True happiness, for her, comes from personal growth and seeing that she has inspired others to enter crypto or start their own businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

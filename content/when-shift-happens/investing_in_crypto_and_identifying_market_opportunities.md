Tarun Chitra, Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital, a thesis-driven investment firm specializing in cryptocurrencies, tokens, and blockchain firms, believes that the next trillion-dollar businesses will be built using blockchain rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Those who build and [[investment_opportunities_in_crypto | invest]] in these businesses are expected to generate the most wealth over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Multicoin Capital notably placed an early bet on Solana in 2018 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The firm was launched in 2017 to address a market gap, as there were only a couple of existing funds, and they weren't providing clear frameworks for understanding and valuing crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

## The Core Thesis: Blockchain as a Coordination Mechanism

Multicoin Capital's central thesis is that crypto will facilitate the largest single shift in wealth in Internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. This conviction stems from historical patterns: new coordination mechanisms consistently lead to immense wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. Blockchain, at its core, is viewed as a credible coordination mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. Just as the printing press led to new forms of social organization like the LLC and joint-stock corporations by changing communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>, the internet, which is as significant a communication change, requires new internet-native coordination layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Ethereum, for example, was identified as a new coordination layer for distrusting people to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

## Key Principles for Crypto Investing

### Identifying Market Opportunities

When considering [[investment_strategies_in_crypto_markets | investment strategies]], a primary focus for Chitra is on identifying unmet market needs. In the case of Solana, the conviction was based on the belief that users prioritize three things in a blockchain: cheapness, speed, and ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. Solana delivers on all three, with low transaction costs, fast block times, and a simplified user experience (one wallet, one chain, avoiding complex bridging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. While newer chains may offer similar benefits, Chitra notes that to unseat an incumbent like Solana, a competitor must be *significantly* better, not just marginally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

### The Importance of Patience and Conviction

A crucial aspect of [[investment_strategies_in_crypto_markets | investing in crypto]] is patience. The hardest part of investing is not buying or selling, but waiting for a thesis to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. These processes take time and involve compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. Deep conviction must be paired with patience to achieve exceptional returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. This was evident with Solana; initial progress was slow, with bugs and a lack of ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>. Chitra even considered selling, but the team's decision-making structure helped maintain patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

A mental framework to avoid impulse decisions is to consider that holding an asset daily is equivalent to choosing to buy it every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. The ideal portfolio is one where, each day, capital is deployed as if starting from zero, into chosen assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

To develop patience, one must practice and honestly analyze mistakes of impatience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. For new crypto investors, it's vital to recognize that only a few strong bets per cycle are needed for significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>; attempting too many spreads focus and often leads to missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

The "waiting game" becomes too long when the original thesis is invalidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. Brutal honesty with oneself is critical, as self-deception is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

### Managing Volatility and Emotion

In the face of market fluctuations and "FUD" (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), Chitra employs several strategies:
*   **Indifference to external opinion:** He states he doesn't care what others think, viewing haters' opinions as their problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.
*   **Experiential wisdom:** Having navigated previous crashes (like 2018 and March 2020), he understands that things are "never as good as they seem, but also never as bad as they seem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>. This experience also taught him not to make significant portfolio changes during periods of extreme volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.
*   **Reframing:** Viewing tough times as periods of adversity to overcome, akin to a "hero's journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. He also finds gratitude in the lows, as they make the highs feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   **Detachment:** Using a mental tool of watching the "movie of my life" to gain an external perspective and appreciate the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>.
*   **Avoiding compulsive checking:** He imposed a self-rule of doing 10 push-ups or squats for every time he checked the price without an intention to trade, to curb the dopamine addiction of price watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. The principle is not to look if it won't change your decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.

Ultimately, [[navigating_opportunities_and_risks_in_the_crypto_market | managing crypto volatility]] and [[decision_making_and_market_success_in_crypto_investing | decision-making]] is about recognizing that you should "never be forced to trade"—neither a forced buyer nor a forced seller, but always trade on your own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## Understanding the Crypto Market's "Ugly Truths"

For success in [[investing_in_crypto_without_relying_on_luck | crypto investing]], some "ugly truths" must be confronted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>:
*   **Limited true use cases (for now):** There are currently only a handful of compelling use cases for crypto, primarily revolving around payments, trading, and capital formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:02">[04:11:02]</a>. While other areas generate excitement, the data suggests they are not yet working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:20">[04:11:20]</a>.
*   **Focus on proven concepts:** Investors should concentrate on clear winners with a defined thesis and visible path to product-market fit, rather than "pie-in-the-sky" ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:31">[04:11:31]</a>.
*   **Avoid "Vibes" Investing:** Many investors invest based on "vibes" rather than rigorous analysis of how a project would actually succeed in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:56">[04:11:56]</a>.
*   **Embrace "Dumbing Down":** To avoid analysis paralysis, it's often easier to "go left"—simplify explanations and look for straightforward reasoning. If an investment isn't a "hell yes," it should be a "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:22">[04:22:22]</a>.

## Identifying World-Class Crypto Founders

When Multicoin Capital looks for founders, they prioritize two key traits:
1.  **High Agency:** This refers to individuals who "find a way" to achieve their goals, even when facing significant obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. They don't just "color in the lines" or adhere to social norms if it's not the optimal path. College dropouts can be an example of high-agency individuals, as they prioritize their own best interests over conventional paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
2.  **Intellectual Honesty about Trade-offs:** Founders must be able to articulate the downsides and costs of their approach, and understand why existing systems function as they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. An unwillingness to acknowledge potential flaws or challenges indicates a lack of intellectual honesty and self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. This also involves the ability to admit when one might be wrong or has made mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.

Founders like Anatoly Yakovenko (Solana) and Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum) are admired for their ability to focus on ideas and avoid attacking others, even when criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>. Others, like Cindy and David from Drift, are praised for their resilience, getting back up after being "punched in the face" by challenges like protocol hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. Ariel from Hivemapper is highlighted for his clear vision and intellectual honesty about trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Potential "Black Swans"

Chitra also considers future "black swans" that could impact the market and broader society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Most are financial, such as how AI might collapse margins by making competition easier and increasing open-source tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. He views collapsing margins as positive for consumers, arguing that an economy's organizing principle should prioritize consumers, not producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Regarding Solana's potential downsides, he acknowledges risks from unforeseen technological breakthroughs (like zero-knowledge technology advancements) or unfavorable regulatory regimes, especially given its U.S. origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. The future, he believes, is path-dependent and not inevitable; it's a "weird and wacky place" with a lot of chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

Outside of crypto, Chitra predicts potential new wars due to rising global tensions and the end of American hegemony, which he believes people are not ready for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.

### Philosophy of Self-Sufficiency and Freedom

A core belief is that the purpose of professional endeavors should be to create a wealthy society for citizens, not just for producers to earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Chitra's professional mission is to increase access to the financial system, advocating for self-custody in crypto. He sees self-custody as a "Trojan Horse" for individuals to realize property rights, change their psychology, reduce dependence on the state, and embrace self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He is strongly against centralized decision-making and aligns with voluntarism, believing people should never be forced to do anything that doesn't harm others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This also extends to his belief in the importance of self-defense and the Second Amendment as a fundamental right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.

He attributes his own drive to growing up poor, which instilled a desire for a better life for his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. His decision to start a family is rooted in recognizing his own mortality and a sense of responsibility to contribute to the longevity of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>. He views having children as a form of "selfishness" because it increases happiness and ensures continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>, contrasting with the prevailing pessimism about bringing children into the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. He also believes in Darwinism, emphasizing the need to "multiply or die" as a fundamental truth of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.

In summary, Chitra's approach to [[investment_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | crypto investing]] is rooted in a deep understanding of market mechanisms, coupled with personal principles of self-sufficiency, intellectual honesty, and long-term conviction, navigating the inherent volatility with resilience and a philosophical perspective on success and happiness.

The journey of an entrepreneur is often shaped by their cultural background and early life experiences. Ben, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, shares how his upbringing in China and subsequent experiences abroad influenced his approach to business and life.

## Early Life and Family Values

Ben grew up in Dalian, a city in Northern China, until he was 11 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. His parents were described as very liberal, not adhering to the typical Chinese parental strictness regarding academic results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. This liberal approach extended to allowing Ben to be left-handed, a rarity in China where 99% of left-handed children are corrected to use their right hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. This upbringing fostered a willingness to challenge authority rather than blindly follow orders, a trait Ben believes was passed down from his family's position and willingness to challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

His family had a strong [[the_influence_of_early_life_experiences_on_entrepreneurial_success | entrepreneurial spirit]] and global exposure:
*   His grandparents were highly educated; his grandfather managed the Dalian Daily newspaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   His father was among the first in China to start private businesses, including restaurants and a pioneering agency for sending students overseas in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>, which exposed him to global influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
*   His mother was the first graduate of Dalian University's Japanese language program and held a general manager position at Mitsubishi China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

Due to his parents' demanding careers, Ben spent his early childhood living with his grandparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. This living arrangement was common in China for his age group, as parents prioritized creating wealth and breaking class barriers to provide more resources for their children, like the opportunity to study abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

## The Pursuit of Wealth and Security in Chinese Culture

In Chinese culture, wealth is often seen as the ultimate form of protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Ben explains that the police system in China doesn't offer as much protection as personal wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. This cultural belief stems from the scarcity of resources, where wealth provides fundamental security and alternatives for basic needs like medical treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. This mindset, particularly prevalent in developing countries, emphasizes self-responsibility through financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

### Gambling and Social Mobility
The prevalence of gambling in Asia, and specifically China, has historical roots, as prostitution and gambling were legal and part of daily life for centuries before the Communist party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32:00">[43:32:00]</a>. More recently, high unemployment rates among young graduates (up to 40% in China) lead many to seek "fast money" through gambling, as they feel conventional paths won't allow them to break social barriers or afford basic necessities like an apartment in a major city within a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:00">[44:22:00]</a>. Social media showcasing extravagant lifestyles further fuels this desire for rapid wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:08:00">[45:08:00]</a>.

## Impact of International Education

Ben's father, recognizing that his son might not thrive in China's extremely academic and memory-based high school and university system, started preparing him for education abroad at age 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. Ben spent two months in Australia at 10, then moved to New Zealand at 11, where he completed high school over five to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>. He then received a scholarship to study in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>.

This international experience profoundly impacted Ben's values. Living alone with various host families (Mormon, South African, local Kiwi) in New Zealand allowed him to independently form his own core values between the ages of 11 and 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>. He developed a direct and honest communication style, inspired by the down-to-earth nature of New Zealanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>. This directness, while sometimes blunt, aims for efficiency in his role as CEO, and he believes transparency fosters trust within his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. He views honesty as the "most efficient energy saving" approach in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>. This also contributed to his [[the_importance_of_support_and_relationships_in_entrepreneurship | independent decision-making]] and confidence, which he attributes to his [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurial success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Culture in China and its Evolution

China's approach to the financial industry, particularly foreign exchange (Forex) trading, highlights a significant cultural and regulatory influence on [[entrepreneurship_culture_in_india | entrepreneurship culture in India]]. From 2010 to 2016, Forex experienced a "golden age" in China, driven by a growing middle class with limited investment options and a desire for higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58:00">[38:58:00]</a>. Retail-facing brokers offered high leverage and exposure to global currencies, attracting many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>. This led to a boom in "agents" teaching Forex trading across various city tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:47:00">[40:47:00]</a>.

However, starting in 2016, the Chinese government aggressively cracked down on Forex trading, viewing it as a means to move money out of China and banning all forms of leverage trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:38:00">[48:38:00]</a>. This crackdown led to dangerous situations, with clients disrupting operations and threatening suicide if they lost money, knowing firms couldn't call the police due to their illegal status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:11:00">[50:11:00]</a>. Ben describes these experiences as "crazy" and ultimately led him to leave the industry in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:14:00">[51:14:00]</a>. This demonstrates how regulatory environments significantly impact the landscape for entrepreneurs.

## Lessons from Entrepreneurship

Ben's [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]] emphasizes the importance of focus and passion. He observes that many successful entrepreneurs and figures in crypto were or are gamers, attributing this to their ability to focus intensely on solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>. He believes parents should allow children to explore activities that naturally capture their focus, rather than forcing them into predefined paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:17]</a>. His approach to parenting is to expose his children to various activities to help them discover what they are passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:09:00">[42:09:00]</a>.

He contrasts the traditional life path (school, job, family, retirement) with a more exploratory approach, stressing that the saddest thing is when individuals don't know what they are passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>. Ben believes that [[personal_reflections_on_entrepreneurship_and_mindset | true passion]] is what sustains entrepreneurs through difficult moments, and one must "try really hard" and not abandon endeavors prematurely to find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:33:00">[46:33:00]</a>. He advocates for trying multiple things simultaneously to discover what truly resonates, even if it means short-term personal sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:00">[46:58:00]</a>.

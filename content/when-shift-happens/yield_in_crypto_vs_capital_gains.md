The fundamental question for newcomers to the crypto space is how to [[building_wealth_in_crypto | build wealth in crypto]] without relying on luck or falling for scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Initial Investment Strategy: Bitcoin and Dollar-Cost Averaging
The initial advice for anyone entering crypto is to "just buy Bitcoin and dollar cost average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This involves buying a consistent amount with paychecks and holding it to gain familiarity with the market's volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. New investors must learn to endure significant corrections, such as a 40% drop, to become accustomed and "numb" to the volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

While Bitcoin serves as "digital gold" and a "store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, many new participants quickly seek more speculative opportunities to make money beyond a simple 2x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Bitcoin has historically generated significant returns, averaging around 150% since 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, seeing others make 100x gains on altcoins can push investors into a "danger zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, leading them to invest heavily in highly speculative "Fartcoin" type projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Speculative Assets and Memecoins
For highly speculative assets, it's advised to allocate only a small portion, such as 10%, of one's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The probability of these assets going to zero is approximately 85% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A prime example of this risk is the Luna crash, which, despite massive losses for investors, never became a meme coin as some had hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This event underscored the importance of [[investment_strategies_in_crypto_markets | portfolio allocation]] and [[investment_strategies_and_managing_risk_in_crypto | risk management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Lessons from past crashes, like being over-leveraged on platforms like BitMEX, highlight the self-imposed risks investors often undertake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## The Risks of Chasing Yield in Crypto
Beyond volatility and speculative assets, the crypto space is fraught with other risks, including those associated with seeking [[yield_optimization_in_crypto_space | yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. When attempting to earn interest on holdings through DeFi protocols, assets can go to zero immediately if something goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Other risks include:
*   **Wallet Hygiene**: Poor practices can lead to hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Impersonation Scams**: Malicious actors impersonating legitimate entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

A "paranoid" mindset is crucial for managing these risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Becoming complacent, as seen with the Luna arbitrage scenario where an investor was "making money doing nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, can lead to severe losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the primary goal in crypto should be [[investment_opportunities_in_crypto | capital gains]], not yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The pursuit of an "extra few percent" of yield carries disproportionate risks, especially when there's a percentage chance of losing all principal without knowing the precise odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Even with concepts like [[bitcoin_yield_earning_strategies | Bitcoin DeFi]] and Bitcoin staking gaining traction, the concern remains about potentially losing "pristine collateral" like Bitcoin for yield paid in another token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. While institutional players and Bitcoin ETFs may seek yield on their Bitcoin holdings, often through borrowing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, such products are deemed more suitable for professionals who understand the underlying counterparty and liquidity risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

Yield enhancement products, like those offered by Lido, involve complexities such as yield curve mismatches and liquidity management that are not fully stress-tested in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. For the average person, chasing a "20% yield" to "be rich" often leads to taking on unknown and excessive risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

The focus should be on managing risk and ensuring that the significant [[the_risks_and_strategies_for_capturing_crypto_market_gains | capital gains]] potential of crypto assets like Bitcoin is not jeopardized by chasing a comparatively small yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

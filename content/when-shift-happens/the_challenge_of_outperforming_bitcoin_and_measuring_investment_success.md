From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

The cryptocurrency market has changed, making successful decision-making significantly harder than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Key decisions at different points in time, periods, and situations can lead to extremely different outcomes, to the tune of 10x or 20x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Arthur Chang, founder and CIO of Defiance Capital, highlights that the market has become more efficient, with participants being "ruthless" about selling assets that don't work and moving capital to those with potential, demonstrating a heightened awareness of opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.

## Defining Investment Success in Crypto

For a fund to be considered among the best, especially over a two to three-year period, it should significantly outperform [[bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency_investment_insights | Bitcoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. If Bitcoin performs 100% to 200% over a two-year period, a top fund aims for 300% to 400% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

However, outperforming Bitcoin is exceptionally difficult:
*   Most funds (approximately 80%) do not outperform Bitcoin, whether liquid or venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   This difficulty is comparable to traditional finance, where about 96% of funds fail to beat the S&P 500 buy-and-hold strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   The challenge increases significantly with the amount of capital managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

For individual investors, outperforming Bitcoin is also very hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. While it may be "doable" for full-time investors managing less than $5 million, it becomes much harder above that threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Many full-time investors, even those with experience, failed to outperform Bitcoin in 2023, often due to being "over-E" (over-invested in Ethereum) or other underperforming Layer 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

This highlights the [[challenges_and_mistakes_in_crypto_investing | survivorship bias]] prevalent in crypto, where only success stories are often shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Investment Success

### Market Maturity and Patience
The crypto market is maturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. While speculative "memecoin" rallies still occur, capital is now more ruthlessly efficient, moving quickly to narratives that show potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Market patience has decreased; if a narrative or project doesn't show significant progress within roughly a year, skepticism grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example
> Ethereum's move to proof-of-stake took five to six years (2017-2023/2024), a level of patience unlikely to be afforded to projects today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Personal Attributes and [[decision_making_and_market_success_in_crypto_investing | Judgment]]
Making a comeback in the market, or achieving significant success, is driven by:
*   A strong sense of self-belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   A never-ending desire to prove oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   Extreme risk tolerance and the ability to prevent market fluctuations from overly affecting daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

> "What separates the great and average investor is being able to have a good judgment to decide when to be flexible and when to stick to the causes." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>

While there's no scientific way to train judgment, it comes down to an entrepreneur's instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. [[the_challenges_and_rewards_of_crypto_investing | Mental flexibility]] is crucial for both builders and investors, knowing when to adapt and when to hold conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

To develop conviction and stay resilient during inevitable market downturns, one must return to first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Identifying what truly attracts one to crypto beyond just making money provides a "north star" that gives confidence the industry will continue to exist and grow due to its strong fundamental value propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. These fundamental propositions include:
*   Reducing artificial friction created by human social constructs.
*   Enabling permissionless access to money and cross-border transfers (e.g., stablecoins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   Coordinating human governance and realizing concepts like the "network state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## [[Investment Strategies in Cryptocurrency | Investment Strategies]] and Outlook

Defiance Capital focuses on three main sectors for capital allocation: Layer 1s, DeFi, and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### Layer 1s
*   **Solana (SOL)**: Has a very decent chance (around 50%) of overtaking Ethereum in market cap within two to three years due to its clear objective of scaling via hardware and focus on consumer use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. While its recent gains need digestion and a transfer of ownership, an eventual Solana ETF could be very bullish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Ethereum (ETH)**: Ethereum's technical roadmap has remained consistent, but the market and industry have evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The delegation of consumer adoption to Layer 2s means that Layer 2 success doesn't necessarily translate directly to Ethereum's success, as fee capture by Layer 2s limits direct benefit to ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The ability to pay gas fees in stablecoins further reduces user attachment to ETH as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Near**: Has the potential to become the "AI blockchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### DeFi
DeFi is considered to have strong staying power and continues to produce growth and revenue, unlike other sectors like metaverse or NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. The changing interest rate cycle (from increases to decreases) also makes DeFi more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Key DeFi plays include:
*   **Aave (AAVE)**: Its fundamental metrics are already above 2021 all-time highs, indicating strong underlying growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Aerodrome (AERO)**: Considered the "economic engine" of Base, channeling incentives to build liquidity and making it a good proxy for exposure to Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Hyperliquid (HL)**: A decentralized perpetual exchange, representing a highly profitable and large business in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Hyperliquid's full fair launch model, lack of VC allocation, and the team's commitment to buying back tokens from the open market foster strong community belief and distinguish it from other projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Ethena (ENA)**: Despite a high initial valuation, its fundamental game plan requires central exchange integration, making strategic VC raises necessary for market adoption and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

### AI in Crypto
AI is still in its early phase, and crypto provides a unique environment for accelerated experimentation due to willingness to fund "crazy ideas" with millions of dollars and tokenization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This allows for exploration of AI use cases beyond traditional, regulated applications. Key AI plays include:
*   **Virtuals (PRIME)**: A leading AI agent protocol that provides infrastructure for building AI agents, serving as a top pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Grass (GRASS)**: Provides live data (beyond static public data) for AI models by leveraging a decentralized network of users contributing their bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This data is highly valuable to AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Filtering Signal from Noise for New Investors

> [!WARNING] Avoid Borrowed Conviction
> Relying on the conviction of others (e.g., from YouTube videos promising 100x gains, or Twitter traders) rarely works for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Even if lucky once or twice, one won't be able to keep gains without building one's own conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

To filter signal from noise, new investors should consider the position and vested interests of those sharing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. People often say things beneficial to their own position, rather than reflecting an honest assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Advice for Newcomers
> Newcomers should play to their strengths, whether that's trading, building, working for a project, or creating content. There are many ways to succeed in crypto beyond just leveraged trading or memecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## [[evolution_of_the_cryptocurrency_market_and_personal_investment_strategies | Evolution of the Cryptocurrency Market]] and Future Outlook

The market has experienced significant structural changes, particularly with the shift in the US political landscape towards a more crypto-friendly administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This shift, previously thought "impossible," will lead to increased adoption across institutional and retail sectors, reducing risk for many players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This period is seen as a "golden age" for builders in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

The traditional four-year crypto cycle, primarily driven by Bitcoin halvings, is becoming less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. As Bitcoin matures into a larger asset class, it will be increasingly influenced by traditional market liquidity cycles and macro conditions rather than just the halving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. While short-term volatility is still possible (e.g., from leveraged plays like MicroStrategy pulling forward demand), a major "blow-up" event is not currently foreseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. ETF inflows, a key indicator, are expected to double in AUM in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

Alexis Cia, co-founder of Yellow Network and GSR, a global leader in crypto trading and market making, shares insights into building and operating a crypto market making firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Inception of GSR

GSR was co-founded by Alexis Cia, who brought a background in software and technology, and a friend with deep expertise in traditional finance and market making from Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. This combination of finance and tech expertise was seen as a "perfect couple" for a fintech company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

In 2013, a client approached them for assistance with market making for Ripple (XRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. The co-founders spent time in Morocco, where Alexis's partner patiently taught him about market making, including order books and bid/ask strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Alexis, who describes himself as a "nerd who loves to code," then translated this knowledge into effective algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

This collaborative approach resulted in highly performant algorithms, making GSR 4 to 8 times more effective than their competitors in market making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

## Navigating Early Market Challenges (2014-2016 Bear Market)

GSR began actively operating around 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. When they started providing liquidity for XRP, the market had a 10% spread, which they significantly reduced to 3%, then 1%, and eventually 0.5% through their market making efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

Despite successful market making, the early years presented significant challenges:
*   **Illiquidity and Token Payments**: Initially, their contracts often stipulated that they had to keep the XRP tokens they earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
*   **Banking Hostility**: In 2014-2015, banks were highly "crypto-unfriendly." Attempts to send earned dollars from exchanges to bank accounts often resulted in the bank accounts being closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. This meant that even if they held fiat, it was difficult to access or use, leaving them with "great money but unusable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Societal Perception**: During this period, crypto was largely misunderstood and perceived as an "illegal underground thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Alexis even faced skepticism from his then-girlfriend, who questioned his career choice and suggested returning to his previous job at the Space Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

## Riding the Bull Run (2016-2017)

The period between 2016 and 2017 marked a significant bull run in crypto. GSR had wisely invested in Ethereum's ICO in 2014 at $0.27 per token, using funds that couldn't be easily banked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. This investment, along with others in new ICOs like Lisk and Golem, proved highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. If held to the top, Ethereum could have yielded 10,000x returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

However, operating a market-making firm during this volatile period was a challenge for [[insights_on_crypto_trading_and_market_strategies | mental health]]:
> "It was a bit like, you know, you win the lottery and you get this, you're you're on the night and you see oh I won the lottery you know it's amazing you know you have all this excitement and you can't sleep because you're so happy and and the next day in the morning you know after a hangover or something you just can't find the ticket you've lost a ticket and that's crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>

New traders found it extremely difficult to endure the rapid gains and losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Initially, GSR was paid in tokens, meaning their entire profit was tied to the price movements of the projects they were market making for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. Alexis's partner, being more conservative, ensured they consistently took some profits, even if not at the absolute peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Evolution

Alexis emphasizes several key lessons from his experience building GSR:

*   **Cash is King**: A critical [[decision_making_and_market_success_in_crypto_investing | learning]] from his earlier venture that failed due to a real estate bubble was "don't trust anybody until your money is in the bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Unexpected events, like partners losing money in Luna or FTX, can impact promised investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **Mental and Physical Well-being**: The intense stress of the crypto market, especially during bull runs, can lead to serious health issues. Alexis's own experience with kidney issues, attributed partly to stress and sleeping only three hours a night in 2017, served as an "awakening call" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. Prioritizing family and a healthy sleep cycle became crucial for efficiency and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **Shift in Motivation**: While making money was a significant outcome of GSR, Alexis realized his deeper happiness came from "building value" rather than just "making money with money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. This led him to co-found Yellow Network in 2018-2019, aiming to build something more aligned with his values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

At the time of Alexis's departure, GSR had grown to between 25 and 50 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, and has since expanded to 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.

### Why Trading Volume is Greater Than Payment Volume

Alexis highlights that while Bitcoin was conceived for payments, the trading volume in crypto far surpasses payment volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. While precise numbers are hard to confirm, daily payment volumes were estimated at $4 trillion, whereas trading volumes were over $100 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. This demonstrates that trading is a much larger industry in terms of money moved compared to payments and remittances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.

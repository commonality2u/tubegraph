This article provides an overview of the [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | Terra]] ecosystem, specifically focusing on how to swap and stake [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] tokens within the [[terra_station_wallet_setup | Terra Station wallet]] and utilize them on [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]].

## Terra Station Wallet Overview
The [[terra_station_wallet_setup | Terra Station wallet]] dashboard offers a snapshot of key ecosystem metrics, including the current [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] price, tax rate, [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] issuance, community pool size, and staking ratio [01:09:00]. The staking ratio for [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] can be significant, with hundreds of millions of [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] staked [01:19:00]. The [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | Terra]] blockchain processes enormous amounts of money, indicating its growing traction and popularity [01:37:00]. In just one week, it has processed hundreds of millions of dollars [01:50:00]. The total number of accounts on [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | Terra]] shows a steady upward trend since its inception, nearing three million wallets [02:02:00].

The wallet section displays current balances, while the history tab provides a brief transaction history, allowing users to follow transactions across the blockchain, similar to Etherscan on Ethereum [02:16:00].

## Swapping Luna and UST
To interact fully with platforms like [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]], users need both [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] and [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] [03:28:00]. Within [[terra_station_wallet_setup | Terra Station]], users can utilize Terra Swap to convert [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] to [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] [03:34:00]. The process is similar to other decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or SushiSwap, where users select the coins and amounts for the swap [03:49:00]. Terra Swap typically offers a slightly better price [04:04:00]. The confirmation box details the amount, slippage tolerance, taxes, and fees before the swap is executed upon password entry [04:14:00].

## Staking Luna in Terra Station
The staking tab in the [[terra_station_wallet_setup | Terra Station wallet]] allows users to stake their [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] [04:54:00]. Users must select a validator from an extensive list [05:01:00]. It is advisable to research validators by checking their voting power (a reflection of pool size), self-delegation percentage, commission taken, and uptime [05:18:00]. Some validators may offer more airdrops or lower fees, and some might impose lock-up periods, so personal research is crucial to pick one that suits individual needs [05:42:00].

## Bonding Luna for Borrowing on Anchor Protocol
Instead of direct staking, [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] can be used as a deposit to bond into [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] and serve as collateral for a loan [06:01:00]. [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] offers a stable and attractive yield, powered by staking returns from multiple proof-of-stake blockchains [06:23:00].

To bond [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]], users navigate to the "Bond" section on [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] and select the amount of [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] to convert into bonded [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] (bLuna) [13:08:00]. A validator must be selected during this process [13:27:00]. The [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | Terra]] blockchain facilitates fast and low-cost transactions, unlike the Ethereum blockchain [14:04:00].

Once [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] is bonded into bLuna, it can be provided as collateral to take out a loan, typically in [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] [12:23:00]. [[bitcoin_staking_and_restaking | DeFi]] loans require careful research [12:32:00]. [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] offers a "net APR" where borrowers are effectively paid in ANC tokens to borrow, representing the difference between the borrow APR and the distribution APR [12:37:00].

### Monitoring Loan-to-Value (LTV)
Users must actively monitor their Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio in real-time [16:50:00]. In [[bitcoin_staking_and_restaking | DeFi]], unlike traditional finance, there is no personal outreach before a [[liquidation_issues_in_the_terra_ecosystem | liquidation]] occurs; if the LTV goes too high, collateral will be automatically liquidated [17:10:00].

A common strategy is to deposit the borrowed [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] back into Anchor Earn to earn a yield, offsetting borrowing costs [17:37:00].

## Anchor Governance Tokens (ANC)
Borrowing and bonding [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] on [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] rewards users with Anchor (ANC) governance tokens [17:56:00]. These tokens can be claimed and potentially [[bitcoin_staking_and_restaking | restaked]] for additional yield, with yields nearing 10% for staking the governance token [18:28:00].

While there is an ANC-[[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] liquidity pool (LP) that offers a higher APR, it comes with the risk of impermanent loss, which is generally avoided by users focused on safe yield generation [18:52:00].

ANC tokens also confer the ability to vote on proposals that impact the [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] system, such as onboarding new collateral types like bonded ETH [19:26:00].

## Unbonding Luna and Repaying Loans
To reverse the process, users first repay their [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] loan [20:17:00]. After repaying, the bonded [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] (bLuna) collateral needs to be withdrawn from [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | Anchor Protocol]] [21:10:00].

The final step is to "burn" the bLuna to redeem the original [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] [22:11:00]. A crucial point to note is that default bLuna redemptions take at least 21 days to process, and slashing events during this period may affect the final amount returned [22:47:00]. Redemptions are processed in three-day batches and can take up to 24 days [22:59:00]. There might be minor slippage during the burning process, meaning the returned [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] might be slightly less than the initial bonded amount due to transaction and burn fees [23:56:00].

## Conclusion
Experimenting with a small amount of capital (e.g., $100) allows users to practice and understand the processes of earning, borrowing, bonding, and governing in the [[bitcoin_staking_and_restaking | DeFi]] space [24:57:00]. This hands-on experience is considered money well spent to grasp yield generation in the crypto ecosystem [25:14:00].

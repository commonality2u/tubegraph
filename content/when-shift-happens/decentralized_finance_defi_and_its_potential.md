[[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | Decentralized finance (DeFi)]] is a rapidly evolving sector within the broader cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem, aiming to reinvent the traditional financial system. Jeff Yan, co-founder of Hyperliquid Labs, champions the potential of [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]], despite its current [[challenges_and_evolution_of_the_decentralized_finance_defi_sector | challenges]].

## The Emergence of DeFi

The notion that the world was ready for [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] became particularly clear following instances where users lost funds on centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The collapse of FTX, for example, served as a "light bulb moment" for Hyperliquid, demonstrating that centralized entities could indeed misuse user funds, providing a tangible reason for people to distrust them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Despite this clear lesson, many users quickly reverted to centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This highlights a key challenge: pushing users to embrace the ethos of [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | crypto]] and [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] means improving the "product" itself â€“ the money and the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. People prioritize user experience (UX), and a "shittier" decentralized version, regardless of its values, will struggle against well-marketed centralized alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## The Vision for DeFi

Jeff Yan views [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | crypto]] as "Humanity's Only Hope at Reinventing the financial system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. He believes finance, as one of humanity's greatest inventions, should have been revolutionized by software, but traditional financial rails remain outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | Crypto]] offers a "great hope" to revolutionize these legacy systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

Key aspects of [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]]'s potential include:
*   **Trustless Operations** Users can interact with applications without needing to trust a central intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Efficiency** Transactions are cheap and instantly settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **User Control** Individuals retain full control over their money, secured cryptographically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. This represents another step towards individualism and human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Programmable Money** The promise of Ethereum allows builders to "program money," creating novel financial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
*   **Accessibility** Financial products like borrowing and lending Bitcoin can be integrated into the [[future_of_bitcoin_defi | DeFi]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Overcoming Them

Despite its promise, the [[challenges_and_evolution_of_the_decentralized_finance_defi_sector | DeFi]] space faces significant hurdles:
*   **Inefficiency in Markets** Crypto markets are "beautifully inefficient," creating opportunities but also contributing to volatility and risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Extractive Industry** The industry has a reputation for being "extractive," often seen as a machine to extract value from retail investors through scam tokens and unethical practices, tarnishing crypto's name and hindering regulatory acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. This includes initial coin offerings (ICOs) and venture capital (VC) funding models that prioritize influential early investors over end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.
*   **Complexity** The freedom and flexibility of programmable money also make it easier to create scams and exploit less informed participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.
*   **Lack of User Adoption** Many projects struggle to gain attention and reflect their true value due to the prevalence of short-term, speculative plays like meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

To overcome these [[challenges_and_evolution_of_the_decentralized_finance_defi_sector | challenges]], Hyperliquid's approach focuses on:
*   **Building a Superior Product** The key is to create products that offer a "10x improvement" over existing non-crypto alternatives, rather than relying solely on "values" or past catastrophes to attract users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **User-Centric Development** Hyperliquid prioritizes building a product that users "use and love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. It actively listens to real users and iterates based on their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **First Principles Thinking** Rejecting conventional business wisdom (e.g., not paying market makers, not taking outside investment, avoiding growth marketing), Hyperliquid focuses on fundamental solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Liquidity** Hyperliquid aims to provide liquidity in a sustainable way, unlike extractive models like FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Community First** The project is very "Community First" and "anti-establishment" (e.g., anti-VCS, anti-market makers as "enshrined entities"). Users are the "first class citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## Hyperliquid's Role: The AWS of Liquidity

Hyperliquid, a Layer 1 blockchain with a decentralized perpetual exchange, aspires to become the "Amazon Web Service of liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This analogy signifies a foundational infrastructure that abstracts away the complexities of the exchange platform, allowing builders to focus on product and user acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

### Builder Codes

A core component of this vision is "Builder Codes," a simple idea that allows anyone to build a financial application on Hyperliquid's order book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>. This enables:
*   **Neutral Backend** Builders can charge users fees in a trustless, protocol-built way, unlike opaque deals with centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.
*   **Seamless Integration** It bridges the gap between user-facing applications (like Binance or Robinhood) and a backend that offers Binance-level liquidity with Ethereum-level neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.
*   **Specialization** Encourages specialized builders who understand their users in a particular region to create tailored financial applications, rather than Hyperliquid trying to do everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.
*   **Regional Focus** To reach the masses, [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] needs more regionally focused applications, addressing localized problems like currency destabilization with interfaces that speak the local language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.
*   **Monetization** Builders can directly monetize the volume they bring to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.

Hyperliquid believes that by providing this robust, open infrastructure, it can foster a new wave of [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. Its Layer 1 chain aims to be a general-purpose platform that integrates with native financial primitives, unlocking further [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook

While the exact future of [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | crypto]] and [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] is uncertain, Hyperliquid is confident that finance will eventually move onto [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | crypto]], and Hyperliquid aims to be the foundational platform for this [[transition_from_traditional_finance_to_decentralized_finance | transition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>. The focus remains on building essential infrastructure components, such as Builder Codes and highly performant liquidity, regardless of the specific trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This aligns with the belief that creating real value through hard work will ultimately be rewarded, leading to a more mature and impactful [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

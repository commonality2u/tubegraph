## Personal Philosophy and Goals
A core value for one founder is prioritizing relationships and connections over all else, emphasizing "people first" rather than just "community first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This approach, while sometimes costing growth opportunities, is deeply embedded in the team's culture, as all members originated from the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

A personal goal is to build a "unicorn" company, which means achieving a billion-dollar valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This goal is considered a tangible and measurable first step towards building one of the best brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

## Entry into Crypto and Investment Ventures

### Accidental Founder and NFT Collection
Entry into the crypto space occurred accidentally, starting by running a generic Discord group for sharing alpha and crypto trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. The founder became an advisor, then a co-founder, of an NFT collection with a Godzilla theme, which saw significant viral success by introducing new concepts such as a small collection size (333 pieces) and making the Twitter account private to generate hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

Initially, the founders took only one NFT each and had no treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. Funds later came from royalties, amounting to approximately 150 ETH, which was placed into a multisig treasury controlled by the founders and six community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. This revenue was further supplemented by a Gen 2 collection launch that raised 300 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

> [!warning] Market Challenges
> The NFT market tanked, and the collection was delisted from OpenSea due to a fake DMCA claim, highlighting the volatility and unexpected challenges in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

### Consulting and Learning from Web2 Businesses
Following market difficulties, a consulting firm was launched to generate revenue and secure whitelist spots for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. This experience helped in understanding that Web2 companies often want a foothold in Web3 for technological innovation rather than just launching NFTs for money, as their fundraising needs are typically much larger than what NFTs can provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.

### PG Capital 2023: An Investment Syndicate
PG Capital 2023 was launched as an [[investment_syndicate|investment syndicate]] to provide access to early-stage (pre-seed or seed) deals with more reasonable valuations compared to public IDOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>. The syndicate was inspired by Neotokyo, which successfully incubated projects and provided deal access to its holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

> [!caution] Challenges of Investment Syndicates
> Operating an [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets | investment syndicate]] involved significant administrative work and risk, as many projects failed or never launched, leading to investor dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. Token vesting terms can also be unfavorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Despite these challenges, some investments saw significant gains, such as Supra, which achieved a 50x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:49">[01:56:49]</a>.

## Redacted: A Web3 Incubator and Accelerator
Redacted is envisioned as a single entity with a token and a series of products built or co-built in partnership with other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:06">[02:26:06]</a>. The strategy involves taking equity, revenue share, and tokens from these businesses, which span various sectors from DeFi to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:46">[02:29:46]</a>. This model allows for adaptability to changing metas (e.g., memecoin meta, DeFi) and targets Web2 audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:06">[02:30:06]</a>.

> [!info] Why Launch a Token?
> Tokens in the Redacted ecosystem serve as attention and reward mechanisms. They attract Web3 audiences to platforms that might not otherwise have a token, providing incentives for users, especially beta testers. This also centralizes value from various products into a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:58">[02:56:58]</a>.

### Founder Accountability and Tokenomics
To align founder interests with investor interests and address concerns about token performance, the founder of Redacted has committed to:
-   Using all salary ($10,000/month) and an additional $10,000 from personal savings to buy Redacted tokens from the open market for a minimum of six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:26">[02:59:26]</a>.
-   Implementing a 12-month cliff for team tokens and burning all team tokens within 24 months if the project does not hit a $100 million market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>.
-   Unlocking only 10% of team tokens for every $100 million market cap achieved, requiring a billion-dollar market cap for 100% unlock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:44">[03:00:44]</a>. This approach aims to prevent founders from dumping tokens and to ensure long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:25">[03:00:25]</a>.

> [!info] Market Cap vs. FDV
> It's argued that achieving a $100 million market cap (tokens in circulation) is significantly harder and more meaningful than a Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV), which can be manipulated with low day-one unlock percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:50">[03:00:50]</a>.

## Investment Principles and Market Approach

### Hedging and Diversification
Investing in competitors, such as Appronics (a rival to Tesla in humanoid robots), is seen as a hedging strategy, similar to holding both ETH and Solana in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:55">[01:49:55]</a>. This approach aims to capitalize on lower valuations of promising competitors even if the market leader is dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

### Identifying Opportunities
Opportunities can arise unexpectedly, often through DMs or social circles where friends or groups are investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:56">[01:59:56]</a>. It is important to follow individuals who have a strong track record and a knack for identifying better opportunities, whether through intuition, a strong network, or insider information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>.

### Long-Term Vision and Resilience
Success in the crypto market is viewed as a combination of hard work, effort, vision, and luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:08">[03:53:08]</a>. The most important component is resilience, adapting to changes, and being willing to pivot when strategies are not working, rather than clinging to egoistic beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:08">[03:55:08]</a>. Having a long runway (e.g., 3-4 years of funding) allows for experimentation and pivoting without immediate financial pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:55">[04:03:55]</a>.

> [!tip] Final Advice for Listeners
> Give teams and projects a fair chance, especially recognizing that many genuine teams have been victims of poor timing or insufficient funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:15">[04:17:15]</a>. Avoid judging solely on stereotypes (e.g., origin) and instead focus on what teams have actually built, their actions during bear markets, and their transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:40">[04:21:40]</a>. Listening to interviews and podcasts can provide deeper insights beyond superficial resumes or single-page descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:09">[04:26:09]</a>.

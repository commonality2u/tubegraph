Investing in crypto without relying on luck requires a disciplined mindset, robust risk management, and a deep understanding of market dynamics beyond short-term speculation. This approach emphasizes conviction, long-term thinking, and a cautious attitude towards the inherent volatility and potential pitfalls of the crypto market.

## The Mindset Shift

Jason Choy, co-founder at Tangent and host of The Blockcrunch podcast, recounts his personal journey from losing all his money in early crypto investments to developing a more disciplined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift involved questioning whether crypto was "real" or just "vaporware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

A key lesson for any investor is the ability to think from first principles about what genuinely drives usage: is it short-term speculation, anticipation of an airdrop, or a protocol that has truly tapped into something sustainable over years? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.

## Core Investment Principles

### Differentiating Narratives from Traction
In the crypto market, especially during bull cycles, there's an over-focus on narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. While the 2020-2021 cycle was driven by metrics in NFTs, DeFi, and games, the current cycle is heavily influenced by meme coins, which lack significant fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. It's crucial to be honest about the games being played: short-term trading is acceptable, but it should not be confused with long-term investing based on narratives alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

Some venture capitalists (VCs) make the mistake of seeing metrics pile up due to airdrop farming and misinterpreting this as genuine "hockey stick growth" typical of Web2 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. In crypto, such growth can completely reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.

### The "How to get rich in crypto without getting lucky" Framework
Inspired by Naval Ravikant, Jason Choy outlined a framework for success in crypto beyond mere luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>:

*   **Avoid Confusing Narratives with Traction**: Unearned value accrues and disappears quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.
*   **Don't Bet What You Don't Have to Win What You Don't Need**: This principle advises against excessive leverage and chasing unnecessary wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>. Nobody *needs* a billion dollars in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Beyond a certain point, people are in it for the game or to outperform others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.
*   **Don't Mistake Leverage for Genius**: Many who brag about "eight or nine figures within a year" tend to be quiet when they lose it all in a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. Combining the availability of leverage with highly volatile assets creates a "casino on steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.
*   **Beware the Dunning-Kruger Effect**: Just because someone made money early in crypto doesn't mean they are experts in cryptography, macroeconomics, or politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>. The [[Challenges and Mistakes in Crypto Investing | Dunning-Kruger effect]] describes when individuals overestimate their expertise in a subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.
*   **Understand Narratives are Crafted**: Crypto runs on narratives, which are crafted by people, and people always have an agenda. "If you can't find the fish at the table, you are the fish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>. It's important to be cautious about coordinated narratives, especially on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.
*   **Pay it Forward**: Helping others in the young crypto space can lead to unexpected opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. Building a reputation as a helpful individual, especially for founders, is crucial for long-term success in the venture business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>. Constantly evaluating relationships for immediate monetary gain can be sensed by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:37">[01:24:37]</a>.

## Learning from Mistakes and Building Resilience

Jason's biggest personal loss was due to the FTX collapse, where he lost all his cashed-out equity from Spartan Group, which he had put on FTX as a "bank account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. This experience instilled a deep sense of cynicism, but also gratitude for learning lessons early that others might only encounter later in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>. This led to a "[[cynical_optimism_in_crypto_investing | cynical optimism]]" towards crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:45">[01:32:45]</a>.

The ability to withstand volatility is key, and it requires strong conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. If you don't believe in a protocol and are only in it for a quick profit, you likely won't survive bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

## Risk Management and Profit Taking

Effective risk management involves:
*   **Disciplined Profit Taking**: Jason sold all his crypto in December 2021 due to qualitative signs of a market top, understanding crypto's cyclical nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.
*   **Strict Custody Rules**: Learning from FTX, Tangent enforces strict rules on how much assets can be held on what venues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.
*   **Margin of Safety**: Applying traditional finance concepts like a "margin of safety" (Warren Buffett) is crucial in crypto. This means understanding how much a premium has already been priced in and how much further it could fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Buffering for Volatility**: Don't be fully leveraged before a drawdown, or you lose the ability to buy more when prices are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Invalidation Strategies**: For liquid tokens, there are two ways to invalidate a position:
    1.  **Thesis Invalidation**: The original investment thesis hasn't played out, often after a factor of time (e.g., six months for a protocol to reach escape velocity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.
    2.  **Price Invalidation**: The price drops to a point beyond the maximum acceptable loss, forcing a cut and re-underwriting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.

## Balancing Risk Across Life Domains
Adam Grant's concept of successful entrepreneurs as risk managers, not just risk-takers, applies here: those who take massive risks in one domain (e.g., crypto [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets | investing]]) must have stability in other aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. This "table" of risk should have multiple stable "legs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. For Jason, these include:
*   **Family and Personal Relationships**: A stable social life is a significant anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.
*   **Progressive Personal Pursuits**: Engaging in activities that allow for continuous improvement, like a sport or learning a language, helps maintain mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Jason himself took up Jiu-Jitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.
*   **Financial Buffer**: Having enough money to cover living expenses for several years can significantly reduce anxiety and allow for more aggressive risk-taking in ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.

## Current State of Crypto Venture Investing and Opportunities

Jason believes [[Investment opportunities in crypto | apps will outperform protocols]] in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:28">[01:54:28]</a>. The current problem in crypto venture investing stems from too much money (e.g., $20 billion) chasing too few deals (e.g., $200 million worth of seed-stage companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>. This leads to:
*   **Jacked-up Valuations**: Protocols list at very high prices, making it harder for retail investors to see significant upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>.
*   **Meme Coin Popularity**: Retail investors turn to meme coins because "tier one L1s" or new apps often offer limited upside due to already high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>.
*   **Market Correction**: This dynamic will self-correct as VC returns compress, leading to fund size shrinkage and a market reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>.

The "fat protocols" thesis (where protocols capture most value) is being challenged by successful applications like Axie Infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>. Market makers also contribute to high valuations by only onboarding protocols worth $100 million at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>.

### Meme Coins
While meme coins as a category have "Lindy" (longevity) and significant mindshare, specific meme coins have short lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:49">[01:45:49]</a>. They function as a distribution channel for social communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>. However, attempts to "intellectualize" or "productize" meme coins often lead to underperformance, as it can kill the core meme narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>.

### Notable Projects (Alpha Picks)
Jason highlighted specific projects he sees as promising, emphasizing that these are application-focused:
*   **Athena**: Pitched as the "first internet native Bond," Athena generates yield from ETH staking and shorting ETH on centralized exchanges. Its controversial reliance on centralized exchanges for efficiency challenges the traditional crypto-native definition but has enabled significant scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>.
*   **Say**: Initially an "app-in-a-chain," Say identified that existing DeFi exchanges were clunky due to infrastructure limitations, even on fast chains like Solana. They built a chain specifically to support high-performance perpetual swaps, with a strong focus on execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:32">[01:51:32]</a>.
*   **Farcaster**: Though not an investor, Jason highlights Farcaster's evolution from a simple Twitter clone to a crypto browser with innovative features like "frames" (minting coins in the feed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>. Its ability to regain market interest after a period of decline is a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.

## Conclusion
True [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets | investment strategies in crypto markets]] involve a blend of traditional finance principles, strong conviction, careful risk management, and a willingness to learn from painful experiences. It's about building a sustainable approach that prioritizes long-term outcomes and personal well-being over short-term gains and external validation.

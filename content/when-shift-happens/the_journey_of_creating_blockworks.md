Blockworks, a prominent crypto media empire valued at $135 million, was co-founded by Jason Yanowitz, who also hosts "The Empire Podcast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The company's journey began with an initial fascination with cryptocurrency and evolved through significant pivots and challenges.

## Origins and Early Days

Jason Yanowitz's initial entry into the crypto world was sparked by an eloquent talk about Ethereum he heard at an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This led him to the idea of starting an Ethereum consulting firm for large enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. He initially sought partners, but only two friends were "crazy enough" to join him: Mike and another person who later joined Galaxy Digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Mike, a college friend, stayed on as co-founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

At the time of Blockworks' founding in December 2017, Jason and Mike were both 23 or 24 years old, with limited personal fundsâ€”each had about $5,000 in their bank accounts and invested most of it into the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Jason even used credit cards to buy crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Jason's entrepreneurial spirit was evident from a young age, influenced by his college-dropout parents who were also entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. He recalled reselling baseball cards on eBay in third grade and getting involved in multi-level marketing in college, which he later recognized as a pyramid scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This early experience taught him about sales and controlling his own destiny, programming him to never work a 9-to-5 job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

After a brief stint in venture capital, where he found the system archaic and struggled to get colleagues on board with crypto investments, Jason realized the need for a crypto media platform that felt more like the Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## The "Ass Backwards" Evolution of Blockworks

Initially, the idea for an Ethereum consulting firm faced skepticism, prompting Mike to suggest building a brand and community first through events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This led to Blockworks starting with small, profitable happy hour events in Chinatown, generating around $10,000 profit per event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

Blockworks' early strategy was driven by the need for cash flow, leading them to prioritize services over building their own intellectual property (IP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. They built podcast networks for others, like Anthony Pompliano's "Off The Chain" (now "The Pomp Podcast"), and ran events like the [[multicoin_summit | Multicoin Summit]] for other companies, generating revenue without owning the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Jason later reflected that this approach, while generating cash, wasn't scalable or building a true business, as they weren't building IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. He noted that they "built the company ass backwards" compared to typical media companies that start with content, build an audience, and then monetize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.

## Pivotal Moments and Strategic Shifts

### Betting the House on Conferences
In May 2019, Blockworks made a significant "bet the house" decision, transitioning from small happy hours to large-scale conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:19">[01:31:19]</a>. Their first major event, "Digital Asset Summit" (DAS), cost $250,000, nearly their entire bank account of $230,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. Its success was critical, as failure would have ended Blockworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### The COVID-19 Pivot
The onset of COVID-19 in March 2020 was another critical moment. Conferences accounted for 82% of Blockworks' revenue, which was wiped out overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. This forced a strategic pivot to focus on digital revenue streams. During this period, the team whiteboarded what the business should become, considering options from a "morning brew for crypto" to competing with CNBC or even pivoting to cannabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

They ultimately decided to become a comprehensive media business, recognizing a gap in the market for high-quality news, media, and podcasts in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>. In Q1 2021, they spent nine months building an editorial website, rebranded from "Blockworks Group" to "Blockworks," hired reporters and journalists, and began producing their own in-house content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>. This meant cutting off outsourced podcasts to focus on owning their own IP, leading to the launch of "Empire" (hosted by Jason) and "On The Margin" (hosted by Mike) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:13">[01:34:13]</a>.

## Business Model and Strategy

Blockworks' current model integrates four core areas:
1.  **News Business:** Builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:54">[01:49:54]</a>.
2.  **Podcasts and Newsletters:** Build distribution and audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:56">[01:49:56]</a>. Podcasts are considered the most intimate form of content consumption and advertising, fostering trust with listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:43">[01:36:43]</a>.
3.  **Conferences:** Generate cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>. While high-risk due to significant upfront costs and the need to plan years in advance, they can fund other parts of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>.
4.  **Research and Data Business (Analytics):** Contributes to the company's enterprise valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>. This is the most valuable revenue stream in terms of market valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>. Blockworks utilizes a negative customer acquisition cost model, where their media content drives inbound leads for their research platform without direct marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

Jason believes that the future of media lies in B2B media with a product at the bottom of the funnel, focusing on an "owned" audience (podcast downloads, newsletter subscribers) rather than rented audiences (web traffic, social media followers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He emphasizes that media is a "trust game," and trust cannot be bought with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:21">[01:46:21]</a>.

## Raising Capital and Managing Pressure

Blockworks bootstrapped for its first six years, focusing on profitability and cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:30">[01:50:30]</a>. In May 2023, they raised $12 million at a $135 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:43">[01:47:43]</a>. This raise increased the stakes and shifted focus towards the analytics and research side of the business due to its higher enterprise valuation potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:40">[01:51:40]</a>.

Despite the pressure, Jason and Mike consciously chose a smaller raise from only three deeply trusted investors to avoid the pitfalls of short-term cash flow temptations that could compromise brand trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>. They prioritize maintaining trust and authenticity, refusing to take payments for podcast guests, even if it means sacrificing short-term revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:48">[01:52:48]</a>.

## Organizational Growth and Hiring Philosophy

Blockworks grew to about 75 employees, experiencing common growth pains around 50 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>. Jason realized that organizational structure, particularly the lack of a leadership team, was the root cause of feeling "stuck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>. Overcoming this involved bringing in experienced leaders with deep industry knowledge to manage specialized functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.

Their hiring philosophy emphasizes two "non-negotiables":
1.  **Curiosity:** Essential in a fast-moving industry like crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>.
2.  **The "Airport Test":** Hiring people you'd genuinely enjoy being stuck with for eight hours in an airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:32">[01:26:32]</a>.
For leadership roles, alignment on "how you think" about problems is paramount, even more so than just "how you do the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.

## Personal Challenges and Lessons Learned

Jason shared his struggle with cluster headaches (also known as "suicide headaches"), an intensely painful neurological condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. The pain scale ranks them as a 10 out of 10, often leading sufferers to desperate measures to escape the pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:16">[01:56:16]</a>. He had been reluctant to share this publicly, fearing it might be perceived as a weakness in the business world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. However, he decided to open up to encourage other founders to discuss their struggles, recognizing that many experience physical manifestations of stress and that "the job of a founder is basically enduring pain 24/7" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>. He also highlighted how broken the healthcare system is, especially for rare diseases, due to a lack of financial incentive for research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.

Jason believes burnout stems not from overworking, but from working on things that are not meaningful or enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. He loves pushing the company's "boulder up the hill" and finds fulfillment in the struggle, even if it's not always "happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>.

## Market Outlook and Future Prediction

Jason believes a "pretty colossal bull market" is coming for crypto, which people are currently underestimating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. He points to Bitcoin's all-time high amidst rising interest rates, the potential for a dollar bear market, declining interest rates, and the upcoming election season as key factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:18]</a>. He has strong conviction in the industry, citing the underrated impact of ETFs and crypto as potentially the "last investable vertical" for venture firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:29">[01:49:29]</a>. By 2025, he predicts that every venture firm will need a crypto strategy, and institutions will begin making significant allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:19">[01:50:19]</a>.

Reflecting on [[building_wealth_in_crypto | building wealth in crypto]] and company growth, Jason emphasizes the importance of design for early-stage companies to appear larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>. He also advises building for a niche audience as long as humanly possible, fostering a "cult following" rather than immediately seeking mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:33">[01:46:33]</a>.

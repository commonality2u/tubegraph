On a Friday night, Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, one of the largest crypto exchanges, received a call confirming a massive hack that resulted in a loss of 400,000 Ethereum, valued at $1.5 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This event triggered an immediate and comprehensive [[resilience_in_business_and_its_importance_in_the_crypto_market | crisis management]] response from Bybit.

## Immediate Response: The First 10 Seconds and Beyond

Upon learning of the hack, Zhou's initial reaction, lasting about 10 seconds, involved a moment of shock, shaking, and sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, he quickly "snapped out" of it, recognizing there was "no point to worry about the money and think about the money and the damage and the consequence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Assessing the Damage

The first critical questions posed by Zhou to his team were about the scope of the hack:
*   How did it happen? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>
*   Are other wallets secure? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>
*   Is the problem contained? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>
*   Is the system intact, or is it a third-party issue? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Can Bybit cover the loss with its own funds? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>

The confirmation that the hack was limited to a specific Ethereum cold wallet using Genesis Safe, and that Bybit had sufficient funds to cover the $1.5 billion loss from its own reserves, provided significant relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This meant client funds were safe, and the company would not face immediate legal consequences or need to seek external investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### Activating Crisis Procedures

Bybit has a predefined "P-minus-one" critical incident procedure for events impacting over 10,000 clients or causing more than $1 million in damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This system, drilled monthly, automatically alerts and convenes management, with assigned roles for note-taking, commanding, and instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Despite the established protocols, a significant amount of "judgment" was required due to the unprecedented nature and scale of this particular hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Prioritizing Client Safety and System Integrity

A key concern was preventing a bank run, similar to those experienced by other crypto platforms in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Bybit's primary goal was to "make sure that everyone knows Bybit is okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. The decision was made to keep withdrawals open, a rare move in such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

### Transparent Communication Strategy

Zhou chose to be the direct public face of the crisis, drafting the first tweet himself and conducting live streams, rejecting suggestions to use only Twitter Spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. He believed it was "very critical that me on my face looking the camera tell everyone what happened as the founder and CEO of the company" to build trust and prevent speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

### Maintaining Trust During a Bank Run

While Bybit was "one to one backed with client asset," the immediate issue was a shortage of Ethereum to meet withdrawal demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Zhou aimed to demonstrate Bybit's solvency by allowing clients to withdraw, proving its one-to-one backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. The company successfully processed around 350,000 withdrawal requests within 12 hours, without rejecting any <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

### Securing Liquidity

To address the Ethereum shortage, Bybit sought bridge loans of Ethereum from partners, offering Bitcoin and USDT as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Direct market purchases were avoided to prevent price volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

Challenges encountered included:
*   Genesis Safe, the affected third-party wallet service, shutting down its service, trapping funds from potential lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.
*   Bybit's own $3 billion USDT reserves were also stuck in Genesis Safe, limiting immediate access during peak withdrawal requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.
*   The wallet team rapidly developed and tested new software to safely transfer the $3 billion USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

### CEO's Mindset

Ben Zhou reported not feeling stressed during the crisis, attributing this to his philosophy of acting on what is within his control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. He described his immediate shift to "battle mode," focusing on making decisions that would secure Bybit's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. His Whoop strap even showed a low stress score despite pulling an all-nighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

### Lessons from Early Life Experiences

Zhou believes his ability to remain calm and problem-solve stems from his [[personal_growth_and_recovery_experiences | personal growth and recovery experiences]], having lived alone and dealt with life challenges since age 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. This upbringing taught him not to panic and to find solutions independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

### Real-time Business Intelligence

A critical factor in Bybit's ability to maintain withdrawals and manage the crisis was its robust internal business intelligence systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. These systems provide real-time data on margin calculation, wallet levels, and withdrawal trends, allowing management to make informed decisions and predict the severity of a bank run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. This level of real-time data visibility is rarely seen in other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.

### Investing in the Team

Zhou emphasizes the importance of investing in people, cultivating a "world number one team" that can execute precisely under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. The team's efficiency was evident in handling 350,000 withdrawal requests within 12 hours at night, and their ability to quickly set up professional live streams and manage public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. This involves maintaining high standards, even if it means a "painful process" of firing those who don't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

## The Road to Recovery and Future Outlook

Within three days, Bybit's liquidity was "back to 100%" and institutions were returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The company covered the $1.5 billion loss using its own funds, equivalent to roughly one year of Bybit's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

### Chasing Stolen Funds: Introducing Hackbounty.com

Bybit is launching `hackbounty.com` (or `hackbounty.crypto`) as an industry-first initiative to help track and recover stolen crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This platform aims to aggregate information about stolen funds, identify endpoints (mixers, bridges, exchanges) where money moves, and rank platforms based on their responsiveness to victim requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. It will also allow "bounty hunters" to assist in tracing funds, leveraging blockchain's transparency to solve a blockchain problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.

### Enhanced Security Measures

[[challenges_and_innovations_in_cybersecurity | Cybersecurity]] will be a major focus moving forward. Bybit plans to:
*   Build all security solutions in-house, preventing reliance on third-party solutions that might become targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.
*   Split wallets to minimize exposure if one is breached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
*   Move away from online signing for cold wallets, prioritizing completely offline environments that are physically impenetrable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>.
*   Take full responsibility for their own security infrastructure, rather than becoming "careless" by trusting third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

### Industry Perception and Growth

Despite the incident, Bybit believes its transparent and professional handling has earned the respect of the community and regulators, fostering more trust for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>. This event serves as a "battle test" for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.

Zhou maintains his view that the future is on-chain, but centralized exchanges remain "extremely critical to the whole ecosystem" for onboarding users and offering a diverse range of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. He views the industry as young and continuously improving, moving beyond the perception of being a "scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

### Key Regrets and Lessons Learned

Zhou expressed two main regrets:
1.  Not having an in-house infrastructure for the Ethereum wallet sooner, acknowledging it as his "biggest regret" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
2.  Putting a key team member, the Head of Finance, in a critical signing role, leading to immense personal pressure and guilt for a situation that was not their fault. Zhou intends to implement a policy to protect key personnel from such exposure in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

The incident also highlighted areas for improving the withdrawal system to be even smoother, reducing client wait times during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.

Overall, the Bybit hack became a testament to effective [[handling_a_major_crypto_theft | crisis management]], demonstrating how transparency, decisive [[managing_risk_and_making_informed_investment_decisions | decision-making]], and a strong internal foundation can facilitate swift [[personal_growth_and_recovery_experiences | recovery]] and even strengthen trust in the face of adversity.

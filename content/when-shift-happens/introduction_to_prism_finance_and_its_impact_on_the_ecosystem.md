Prism Finance is an innovative protocol designed to change how users interact with and utilize digital assets within the blockchain ecosystem, offering significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Refracting Digital Assets
Prism Finance aims to "refract digital assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This concept addresses the challenge of illiquidity faced when staking assets like Luna for rewards or airdrops, where assets become locked for periods, such as 21 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Currently, users must choose between staking assets to receive rewards (making them illiquid) or keeping them liquid for other [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] activities, such as using them as collateral for loans, providing liquidity, or trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Prism Protocol enables users to do both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### How Prism Protocol Splits Assets
When a user deposits a token, like Luna, into the Prism vault, they receive a collateral token in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This collateral token can then be split into two underlying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>:
*   **Principal Token (PT)**: Responsible for keeping the asset liquid, allowing it to be used for borrowing, trading, and providing liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For Luna, this is called pLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Yield Token (YT)**: Responsible for earning yield, staking rewards, and airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. For Luna, this is called yLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

The PT and YT are assumed to be in equal parts from a collateral token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This process allows users to effectively split their Luna into two pieces to achieve both liquidity and yield generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### The Prism Mechanism
The Prism mechanism initiates when a yield-bearing asset holder selects a term (e.g., one month, three months, or perpetually) to commit their assets to Prism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The smart contract then mints pLuna and yLuna with a matching maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

**Options for Token Holders:**
*   Stake the Yield Token (YT) in Prism to be eligible for staking rewards and airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   Stake the Principal Token (PT) in Prism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   Trade YT and PT separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   Combine PT and YT in equal amounts to burn them in exchange for a collateral token at any time, which then allows redemption of the original asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

This splitting mechanism creates a new marketplace within the [[functionalities_and_benefits_of_the_prism_protocol_with_terra_ecosystem | Terra ecosystem]] with deep liquid pools for YT and PT trading on an Automated Market Maker (AMM) Decentralized Exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

#### Visualizing the Mechanism
A yield-bearing asset enters the Prism vault, which then splits it into a Principal Token and a Yield Token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. These split tokens offer various participation options and goal achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Prism v1.0 will allow users to create perpetual yield tokens (yLuna) and perpetual principal tokens (pLuna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. A perpetual yLuna token gives the right to Luna staking airdrops forever, until the underlying asset is redeemed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

Prism will support minting, staking, liquidity provision, trading, burning, and redeeming of all these new tokens created from the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Benefits and Innovations of Prism Protocol
Prism is a revolutionary derivatives protocol that introduces new asset classes into [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Key benefits include:
*   **Risk Management**: Users can manage risk associated with volatile prices and unstable yields in a simple, capital-efficient manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Instant Liquidity**: Raise liquidity instantaneously by selling future yield for a chosen period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Yield Guarantee**: Guarantee yield and protect against price movements and liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Leveraged Exposure**: Gain leveraged exposure to an asset's yield or principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Borrowing without Liquidation Risk**: Borrow without liquidation risk or daily funding costs by monetizing an asset's future yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Yield Swaps**: Swap variable-rate yields into fixed-rate yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Capital-Efficient Liquid Staking**: Receive physical delivery of all staking rewards, including airdrops, while being able to trade or deploy assets instantly elsewhere in [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | decentralized finance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Automated Airdrop Claiming**: Automatically claim all airdrops through Prism, reducing administrative burden on portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## The Prism Token
The Prism token will be used for governance on the platform and can be staked to earn staking rewards and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Future Utility (Prism v2)
In the roadmap for Prism v2, validators will be required to pledge Prism tokens as collateral to be considered for Luna delegation from the Prism vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. A similar methodology to Curve's veCRV (v-curve) will be used, meaning longer staking periods for Prism tokens will result in more weight, voting rights, and voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Token Supply and Distribution
The Prism token distribution includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>:
*   30% for community and liquidity incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   15% for airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   20% for the Prism ecosystem fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   35% for team, investors, advisors, and the IDO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## [[prism_protocol_future_roadmap_and_expansion_plans | Future Roadmap]]
Prism's future plans include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>:
*   Adding more Proof-of-Stake assets like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cosmos (ATOM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   Incorporating assets native to the [[functionalities_and_benefits_of_the_prism_protocol_with_terra_ecosystem | Terra ecosystem]] such as UST, Mirror assets, and Anchor Protocol's collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   Supporting respective LP tokens and assets created by new protocols launching, including money market protocols and DEXes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   Enabling protocol bridging for stablecoins like USDC, DAI, and USDT to [[functionalities_and_benefits_of_the_prism_protocol_with_terra_ecosystem | Terra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

The ultimate goal for Prism is to enable users to refract every yield-bearing asset, including yield farms and LP tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Why Terra?
The [[functionalities_and_benefits_of_the_prism_protocol_with_terra_ecosystem | Terra ecosystem]] is chosen due to its truly decentralized algorithmic stablecoin (UST), low fees, fast transactions, and easy accessibility through cross-chain platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Building decentralized platforms on Terra aligns with the future of [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

The Terra Station wallet serves as a core component for interacting with the [[terra_ecosystem_and_the_future_of_decentralized_finance | Terra ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This article provides an overview of its uses, functions, and how to engage with decentralized applications (DApps) like the [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor Protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Dashboard Overview
Upon opening the Terra Station application, users are greeted with a dashboard displaying key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This includes:
*   The current [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   The current tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] issuance and community pool size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   The staking ratio, which has reached a massive 376 million [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Transaction volume, showing the [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | Terra]] network processing enormous amounts of money, with $244 million in the last week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Annualized staking return and tax reward distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   A graph showing total accounts, which has been on a steady upward trend since inception, nearing three million wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Wallet Balances and Transaction History
Clicking on the "Wallet" tab reveals current wallet balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The "History" tab provides a brief transaction history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Users can click on transaction hashes to follow their transactions across the blockchain, similar to Etherscan on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The history also categorizes transactions as sent, received, staking history, and swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Swapping within Terra Station
The "Swap" tab allows users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another, such as [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] for [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This functionality is similar to Uniswap or SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. It is recommended to use "Terra Swap" for a slightly better price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Transactions require password confirmation and are processed quickly with low fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Staking [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]]
The "Staking" tab in Terra Station allows users to stake their [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] by picking a validator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. When choosing a validator, it is advisable to research factors such as their voting power, self-delegation percentage, commission, and uptime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Some validators may offer more airdrops or different fee structures, and some may have a lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Interacting with [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor Protocol]]

### Borrowing [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]]
[[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor Protocol]] allows users to borrow [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] by providing bonded [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] (bLUNA) as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Borrowing can be beneficial as it may offer a net APR where users are effectively paid to borrow in ANC tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

#### Minting Bonded [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] (bLUNA)
1.  Navigate to the "Bond" section on [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
2.  Select the amount of [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] to bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
3.  Choose a validator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Transaction fees are in [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
4.  Confirm the transaction via Terra Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

#### Providing bLUNA as Collateral
1.  On the "Borrow" page, click "Provide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
2.  Deposit your bLUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This will establish a borrow limit, typically 60% of the collateral posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
3.  Confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

#### Taking out a Loan
1.  Use the slider on the "Borrow" page to select the amount of [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] to borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This allows access to [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | UST]] without selling [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
2.  Confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
3.  Monitor your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio in real-time on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Liquidation Risk
> In the DeFi space, it is crucial to monitor your collateral level. If your loan-to-value ratio goes too high, you can be [[liquidation_issues_in_the_terra_ecosystem | liquidated]] automatically, unlike traditional finance where you might receive a warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

### Earning Governance Tokens
By borrowing and bonding, users are rewarded with [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor Protocol]]'s governance tokens (ANC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. These can be viewed and claimed on the "Govern" page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Staking ANC tokens can earn additional yield, around 9.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. These governance tokens also grant the ability to vote on proposals for the [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor Protocol]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

### Repaying Loans and Redeeming bLUNA

2.  Click "Repay" and select the amount to repay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
3.  Confirm the transaction via Terra Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

#### Withdrawing Bonded [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] from Collateral
After repaying the loan, withdraw the bLUNA from the collateral list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This is done on the "Borrow" page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

#### Burning Bonded [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] to Receive [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]]
1.  Head back to the "Bond" section on [[anchor_protocol_as_a_backbone_of_terra_network | Anchor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.
2.  Select your bLUNA and click "Burn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] 21-Day Lock-up Period
> Default bLUNA redemptions take at least 21 days to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Slashing events during this period may affect the final amount withdrawn, and redemptions are processed in three-day batches, potentially taking up to 24 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Be aware of this three-week lock-up period when bonding [[luna_swapping_and_staking | LUNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

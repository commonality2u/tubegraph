Cha Cha Wong, a founding partner of Alliance DAO, a leading Web3 accelerator and founder community, emphasizes that the mission at Alliance is to find the best founders in crypto and help them build products people love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. He also previously served as the founding head of product at Messari, a major name in crypto for information, data, and research aggregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### [[skepticism_and_contrarian_thinking_in_trading | Contrarian Thinking]]

A core trait that Cha Cha Wong identifies in both successful investors and founders is their ability to question the consensus and think in a contrarian way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

> "Your natural stance towards the world is to question things, is to question the consensus... you want to have your default stance towards the world is to is to question things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>

*   **For Investors:** To excel in public markets, an investor's default stance should be to challenge commonly held beliefs and identify what people consistently say that is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. While some argue a great investor needs to be cynical, Wong suggests that [[the_dynamics_and_qualities_of_effective_startup_founders_and_investors | optimism]] and [[skepticism_and_contrarian_thinking_in_trading | contrarian thinking]] are orthogonal traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
*   **For Founders:** The best founders are "extremely contrarian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. Building a startup fundamentally involves uncovering an insight about the market or users that no one else comprehends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:38">[02:07:38]</a>. Wong asserts, "If you don't have a contrarian take, you don't have a startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:09">[02:08:09]</a>. He notes that the worst pitches he encounters simply echo what VCs or the crypto Twitter community are saying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:24">[02:08:24]</a>. He also provocatively states that for consumer-facing product founders, "autism is almost a requirement" because autistic individuals can think independently and are less influenced by the consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:28">[02:11:28]</a>.

### Integrity

Wong views integrity as the "absolute most important quality that a world-class founder must have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>. He uses a formula to explain its importance:

> "Intelligence times work ethics times integrity. Intelligence and ethics are absolute numb, they're positive numbers, the higher the better. But at the end, when you have integrity, if you're integ, if you have integrity, it's a positive one multiplier. If you're yeah, you're low integrity, you're minus one integrity. So if you're really smart and really hardworking and you have no integrity, then that's actually the the worst possible you got a huge negative number that's the worst possible configuration because you're going to kill yourself, you're going to kill your customers, you're going to kill your investors, you're going to kill your users, your co-founders, your employees and the industry..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:08">[01:39:08]</a>

*   **Why it's Crucial:** A person with high intelligence and strong work ethic but low integrity can be extremely destructive, harming customers, investors, users, co-founders, employees, and the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is cited as an example of someone with "extremely high intelligence, work ethics, negative one on the integrity part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:49">[01:39:49]</a>.
*   **The Impact of Money on Integrity:** While some believe money only amplifies existing traits, Wong suggests that "money can change you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:37">[01:40:37]</a>. He believes that "overnight success in the overnight money does change at least the way people how people make decisions," citing Do Kwon as an individual who seemed to change after becoming "too rich too quick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:52">[01:40:52]</a>.
*   **Identifying Integrity:** It is challenging to quickly assess a person's integrity, as people tend to present themselves with good intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>. However, Alliance DAO's accelerator terms, which offer relatively low valuations at the early stage, help to self-select founders who are less opportunistic and more focused on building a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>. Wong appreciates founders who are honest about their motivations, even if they explicitly state a desire to build a billion-dollar business and make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.

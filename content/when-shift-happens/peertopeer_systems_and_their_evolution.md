Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are designed to provide services without relying on a centralized entity to mediate communications or transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. In a P2P system, all participants contribute equally to providing the service, whether it's file storage or a monetary system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. This equality represents an equality of power, allowing participants to collectively offer a system rather than depending on a single centralized entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

## The Early Days: Internet Ethos and Challenges

In the early 2000s, the most exciting idea of the internet was its potential to enable direct interconnections between people, facilitating actions not mediated by traditional large telecommunications companies or banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. This was the core meaning of the P2P movement at the time, often associated with contesting copyright and intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. The essence was to build communities unmediated by large institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

The need for P2P systems stemmed from issues of power and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. P2P movements contested basic concepts like intellectual property and aimed to embody notions of privacy through systems like peer-to-peer anonymity and encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Encryption, for instance, was heavily controlled by governments in the 1990s, making P2P the only viable way to build such technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. Similarly, before modern streaming services, the music industry showed no interest in internet streaming in the early 2000s, making P2P the sole option for accessing media online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

However, early P2P systems faced significant problems:
*   **Sybil Attack**: It was difficult to determine if online entities were real or merely virtual "sock puppets" controlled by a single actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This challenge undermined mechanisms like voting and up/down-voting for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
*   **Lack of Economic Model**: The initial assumption that P2P could rely solely on spare computing, networking, and storage capacity proved to be a fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. Maintaining reliable services costs bandwidth, storage, computation, and operational effort (e.g., waking up to restart a machine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Without an economic model to sustain these operations, most early P2P systems were "best effort" infrastructures that lacked reliability or eventually faded away, supplanted by centralized services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Limited Functionality**: While some P2P systems like BitTorrent became popular for media distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>, they were limited in what they could achieve. They could not support consistent transaction processing, which is crucial for systems requiring agreed-upon states, such as monetary systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

## The Blockchain Revolution: Bitcoin and Ethereum

The landscape of P2P systems began to change significantly with the advent of [[evolution_of_cryptocurrency_infrastructure | Bitcoin]] and then [[evolution_of_cryptocurrency_infrastructure | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>: Bitcoin demonstrated the possibility of building transaction systems in an open, permissionless setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. Before 2009, transaction processing in a permissionless way was considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. Bitcoin addressed the Sybil attack problem through "proof of work," requiring energy expenditure to generate new units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Ethereum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>: [[evolution_of_cryptocurrency_infrastructure | Ethereum]] was a turning point because it introduced a programming language (Solidity), enabling users to define custom rules for updating state and creating smart contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. This expanded the imagination beyond simple ledgers to programmable systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. Ethereum's success also helped establish that transaction systems could indeed be built in a permissionless way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.

A key innovation illustrating Ethereum's potential was CryptoKitties. This application demonstrated that transaction systems could be used for more than just money, showcasing a virtual pet asset with a social aspect that expanded the imagination of what these systems could achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.

## Modern P2P and Decentralized Infrastructure

Today, modern blockchains, like the SUI network, serve as effective coordination layers for building advanced decentralized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. Blockchains excel at coordination, overcoming humanity's age-old inability to coordinate across space and time without intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>. They provide a common, shared accounting system where rules are followed to add new entries, and transactions are settled quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. This eliminates the "tyranny" of intermediaries who extract value from their central position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.

### Walrus Protocol: Decentralized Storage Network

Walrus Protocol is a decentralized secure storage network, designed for rich media and large data files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It addresses the vision of decentralized storage that was impossible 20 years ago due to lacking infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Key features of Walrus Protocol:
*   **Decentralized Storage**: Files are stored across multiple places rather than in one location, eliminating a single point of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Security**: A significant portion of the infrastructure can fail, and users can still access and write their files, ensuring data integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability for Large Files**: Unlike commodity blockchains that store only a few kilobytes, Walrus handles megabytes, gigabytes, and even terabytes of data, such as images, machine learning datasets, and audit logs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>.
*   **Economic Model**: Walrus leverages a robust transaction system like SUI to manage payments for storage, ensuring economic sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>. This addresses the critical flaw of early P2P systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.
*   **Coordination Layer**: The SUI network acts as a coordination layer for Walrus, managing payment, space ownership, data storage, and the set of storage nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>. This enables efficient and reliable operations.

Using a modern blockchain like SUI also allows for combining storage with other decentralized functionalities. For example, storing data on SUI can be combined with [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | DeFi]] protocols to generate yield that pays for perpetual storage, allowing data to "live forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.

## The Future Vision for Decentralized Systems

The overall vision for decentralized systems, championed by companies like Miston Labs (creators of Walrus Protocol and SUI), is to replace all components of the centralized cloud services stack with decentralized alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:44">[01:27:44]</a>. This aims to empower developers to build rich, decentralized applications as easily as building centralized ones on platforms like Amazon Web Services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>. This future promises a more transparent and efficient world for economic activity, moving beyond archaic methods like PDFs and emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>.

Ultimately, this move towards decentralization is about shifting power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. It challenges the ability of centralized infrastructure providers to extract excessive value and exert control over digital interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>. The goal is a more neutral technology foundation, where a handful of large services do not dictate what happens online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>. This vision aims to facilitate the [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | web3]] movement by providing the necessary building blocks for a decentralized future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

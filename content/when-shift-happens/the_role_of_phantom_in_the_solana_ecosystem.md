Phantom is a leading crypto wallet that aims to build the world's best next-generation consumer finance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Its core mission is to accelerate the adoption of crypto by making it safe and easy to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Brandon Milman, CEO and co-founder of Phantom, believes that crypto is a positive force in the world, providing democratized access to financial systems, similar to how the internet democratized access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Genesis and Strategic Focus on Solana

Phantom's inception was influenced by observed limitations in the broader crypto space, particularly within the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Frustrations with Ethereum's User Experience

Brandon Milman's experience, including four years at Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, informed his product development philosophy. He grew disillusioned with traditional Web 2.0 models where monetization models, such as ads, could detrimentally impact user experience and destroy open developer ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

Working at [[role_and_future_of_tokens_in_cryptocurrency_projects | ZeroX]] for almost four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>, Milman and his co-founders, Chris and Franchesca, recognized that the primary barrier to crypto adoption was the wallet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. MetaMask, while dominant on Ethereum, was seen as decelerating adoption due to its complex UI/UX, which often led to significant user drop-offs during onboarding and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

Milman concluded that the Ethereum ecosystem suffered from a "failure to graduate from purely developer-focused mindset into this user-focused mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. This academic and less business-driven approach, coupled with excessive decentralization through processes like EIPs, hindered rapid iteration and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

### The Decision to Bet on Solana

Phantom was founded with two key insights:
1.  Wallet user experience and usability are crucial for unlocking crypto adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
2.  The crypto world was moving towards a multi-chain format due to insufficient supply to meet user demand on single chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.

The initial strategy was to build a multi-chain MetaMask competitor, but to achieve a "pole position" first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. Instead of directly competing with MetaMask on Ethereum, Phantom decided to focus on an up-and-coming ecosystem.

Several factors led to the choice of Solana around late 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>:
*   **Stablecoin Liquidity**: Solana was the second-biggest deployment of USDC at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>, indicating crucial financial activity.
*   **Centralized Exchange Partner**: FTX was deeply involved in the Solana ecosystem, providing an easy on-ramp from fiat to crypto for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. This removed significant friction for liquidity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.
*   **Founders' Ethos**: The Solana founders, Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, were Silicon Valley-based and shared an ethos of pragmatism and an engineering-first approach to building products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. This alignment fostered trust and a shared vision.

## Phantom's Impact on the Solana Ecosystem

Phantom became the first extension-based wallet to be easily used with DeFi and NFTs on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. Its user-centric mindset, strong customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>, and early introduction of features like transaction simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a> and automatic NFT/token display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>, significantly raised the bar for usability on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. This created a "magic-like" first impression for users transitioning from Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.

Phantom rode the "crazy Solana 2021 wave" of price appreciation and the NFT craze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>, gaining the top position among Solana wallets by late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>. The rapid release of a mobile app within four to five months of its initial launch was also pivotal for riding the NFT wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.

Despite the FTX implosion in late 2022, which was viewed by some as a "betrayal of Solana" given Phantom's concurrent multi-chain release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>, Phantom chose to stay and double down on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The team believed in Solana's fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a> and observed a new, distinct demographic of users onboarding due to Solana's faster and cheaper transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>. The FTX event, though challenging, purged "weak hands" and solidified a "genuine core" of true believers, forming a strong community around Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.

## Phantom's Future and Market Position

Phantom's success on Solana led it to become a global phenomenon, with its mobile app reaching as high as number three or four on the iOS App Store in late 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48">[01:25:48]</a>. This demonstrated massive distribution and validated crypto's adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>.

Looking ahead, Phantom aims to evolve into a mass-market consumer finance app, competing with traditional finance platforms like Square Cash, Venmo, Revolut, and Robinhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>. Phantom's advantage lies in its access to a global audience and open, permissionless networks, allowing users access to bleeding-edge investment opportunities unavailable on centralized platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:18">[01:35:18]</a>. Brandon Milman asserts that centralized exchanges and traditional finance apps "can't compete" with the speed and innovation of on-chain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:26">[01:37:26]</a>.

Phantom's long-term goal is to "eat tradfi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:28">[01:40:28]</a> by performing common financial tasks (sending money, interacting with businesses, accessing investments) better through crypto, ultimately becoming the go-to app for these services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. This vision is driven by the belief that crypto will ultimately be a complete alternate financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

### Future Predictions
*   **Stablecoin Proliferation**: Expect a confusing proliferation of stablecoins, followed by eventual consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:43:09]</a>.
*   **Realization of Crypto Payments**: Crypto-enabled payments, both peer-to-peer (like a "crypto Venmo") and user-to-merchant, are expected to finally come to fruition, partly due to initiatives like Stripe's "pay with crypto" efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:32">[01:44:32]</a>.

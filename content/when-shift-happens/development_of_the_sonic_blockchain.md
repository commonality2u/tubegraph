The [[overview_of_phantom_and_its_transition_to_sonic | Sonic blockchain]] is presented as a high-performance EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain, combining speed, incentives, and world-class infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Its development is a significant evolution from its predecessor, Phantom, spearheaded by software developer and entrepreneur Andre Kronh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Origins and Transition from Phantom
The journey to Sonic began with Andre Kronh's deep dive into the [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | blockchain ecosystem]] as a skeptic, performing code reviews of projects claiming to solve long-standing problems in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. He found that most projects were "complete garbage," but a small fraction (0.1%) showed real potential, sparking his interest in new ways of doing finance and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

Kronh's involvement with Phantom, the predecessor to Sonic, was initially accidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. He was asked to perform a code review for the original Phantom team, who insisted on an in-person meeting despite having no functional code or engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Their initial idea was largely a "plagiarized Hashgraph" model, which was not viable for a public blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. However, they had successfully raised capital, providing Kronh an opportunity to implement his own theoretical ideas for a new generation blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

The original Phantom, released around 2018, was considered the fastest blockchain at the time, but it was designed for a different market landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>. Its core consensus mechanism was capable of 50-60,000 transactions per second (TPS) but was hardcapped at 200 TPS due to limitations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

Phantom is now considered "dead" by the core team, with all development focus migrated to Sonic. While the decentralized nature of Phantom means it will continue to exist as long as validators support it, the team's attention and resources are solely on Sonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

## Technical Superiority
Sonic aims to be the "best blockchain out there" due to several technical advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Key features and performance metrics include:
*   **Fastest Consensus:** Sonic boasts the fastest consensus mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>.
*   **Lowest Time to Finality (TTF):** Transactions on Sonic finalize in sub-200 milliseconds, faster than human recognition. This contrasts with other blockchains where finality can take minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>.
*   **Fastest Read/Writes:** Enhances the responsiveness of the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.
*   **High Transaction Throughput:** Theoretically capable of 400,000 transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This is achieved by rewriting the underlying virtual machine while maintaining Solidity and Viper compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.

The speaker uses the analogy of a 56k dial-up modem for current blockchains and ADSL for Sonic to explain its higher throughput and responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.

## Focus on User and Developer Experience
While raw speed is a core component, Sonic's development heavily emphasizes improving user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.
*   **Synchronous RPCs:** Unlike most asynchronous RPCs used by other blockchains, Sonic's RPCs are synchronous, meaning a transaction receives a finalized response immediately upon clicking, enhancing user feedback and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.
*   **DApp Fee Monetization:** 90% of transaction fees generated by a Decentralized Application (DApp) on Sonic go directly to that DApp, not just the validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. This provides a revenue stream for DApps, allowing them to subsidize user actions or operate without needing external revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Fee Subsidies:** DApp developers can subsidize transaction fees for their users, removing the barrier of needing a wallet or gas tokens to interact with the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.
*   **Native Account Abstraction with Economic Abstraction:** Users will not need a blockchain wallet. They can access DApps and interact using familiar Web2 authentication methods like Google Auth, email, or even biometrics. This aims to onboard users without them ever needing to know about Sonic or its native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

These features, while adding a slight overhead that technically makes the blockchain slower, are considered crucial for widespread adoption and improving the overall [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | web3 user experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. The developer's philosophy is that having enough capacity to meet demand and enhancing UX/UI is more important than being a "performance maxi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. The ultimate goal is to have enough users to meet the blockchain's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

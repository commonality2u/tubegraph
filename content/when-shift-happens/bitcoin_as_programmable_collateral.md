From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

Bitcoin, increasingly recognized as the world's premier asset, is transitioning beyond its role as mere "digital gold" to become "programmable collateral" or a "smart asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:40">[03:24:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This evolution aims to leverage Bitcoin as the foundational layer for a new, fairer, and more accessible financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>.

## Why Bitcoin is the Best Asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:39">[03:34:39]</a>

Bitcoin is widely considered digital gold and the best store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:16">[03:46:16]</a>. Its key advantages over physical gold include:
*   **Easier Custody and Transfer**: Bitcoin is digital, making it much simpler to custody, transfer, and fully settle compared to physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Examples like Germany's difficulty in repatriating gold from Fort Knox or large gold thefts at airports highlight the logistical challenges with physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:08">[04:06:08]</a>.
*   **User Control**: As long as an individual maintains control of their private keys, no one else can access their Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:45">[04:41:45]</a>.
*   **Neutrality**: Bitcoin is incredibly neutral; no single country controls it or its supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:36">[01:38:36]</a>. This makes it an attractive asset for international settlement, especially as some nations seek alternatives to the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## The Need for More Utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>

While Bitcoin is often seen as "digital gold," simply holding it is no longer sufficient, particularly for institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:01">[03:59:01]</a>. From a hardcore Bitcoin maxi perspective, Bitcoin as purely digital gold, with its current security model, might not work long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>. Subsequent halvings reduce the fee miners receive, potentially breaking the model unless miners earn enough fees to sustain their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. If miners aren't profitable, Bitcoin's security could be compromised, making it more susceptible to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. To ensure continued security, Bitcoin needs to be used more extensively to generate fees for miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>.

## Enabling Programmability

Several developments have paved the way for Bitcoin's enhanced programmability:

### Taproot Upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>
The Taproot upgrade is a Bitcoin protocol improvement that enabled pseudo-smart contract capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This upgrade made it possible for protocols like Babylon to build a [[Bitcoin staking and restaking | Bitcoin staking protocol]], allowing users to natively time-lock Bitcoin on the Bitcoin protocol itself to enable staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Before Taproot, Bitcoin was not "Turing complete" and lacked the smart contract capabilities of other Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum or Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### Ordinals and Inscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>
Post-Taproot, Ordinals and Inscriptions demonstrated that more programmability was possible on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This led to the creation of Bitcoin NFTs (Ordinals) and the inscription of art and messages directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Unlike some NFTs stored on centralized servers, Ordinals' art is inscribed on Bitcoin itself, ensuring its permanence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Ordinals also helped make the Bitcoin space more open to innovation, challenging the traditional "Bitcoin maxism" that advocated for Bitcoin remaining static <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## Bitcoin DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>

[[Future of Bitcoin DeFi | Bitcoin DeFi]] refers to decentralized finance built around Bitcoin. There are primarily two approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>:
1.  **Native Bitcoin DeFi**: Building DeFi protocols directly on Bitcoin or on Layer 2 solutions that settle directly on Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. The rationale here is that Bitcoin's unparalleled security and immutability make it the ideal settlement layer for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Bridging Bitcoin to Existing DeFi**: Integrating Bitcoin into established "blue chip" DeFi protocols (e.g., Compound, Pendle) on other chains to make Bitcoin the premier asset in the broader crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This approach also seeks to connect Bitcoin with institutions and nation-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

Ethereum has served as a "testnet" for Bitcoin, proving the product-market fit and viability of DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Pioneers on Ethereum created key DeFi primitives that are more efficient, fairer, and transparent than traditional finance counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Now, the goal is to bring these proven DeFi mechanisms and infrastructure to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## Benefits for Builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>

For founders considering building in Bitcoin DeFi versus Ethereum DeFi, the pitch involves:
*   **Massive Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Less than 1% of all Bitcoin is currently utilized in DeFi, compared to 20-30% for Ethereum or Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Even a conservative estimate of 10% Bitcoin utilization in DeFi represents a 10-20x growth opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Institutional and Nation-State Adoption**: Bitcoin is the first crypto asset gaining adoption from institutions and nation-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. As these entities start holding Bitcoin, their inherent financial savviness leads them to seek ways to generate [[Bitcoin yield earning strategies | yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Less Competition**: The Bitcoin DeFi space is newer, meaning significantly less competition compared to the crowded EVM ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Builders can apply innovations and research from EVM to Bitcoin, creating a "founder arbitrage" opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Earning Yield on Bitcoin

[[Bitcoin yield earning strategies | Yield-earning strategies]] on Bitcoin are emerging, moving beyond traditional [[bitcoin_derivatives_and_crypto_trading_strategies | trading strategies]] like delta-neutral options which carry significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Users can now potentially earn "four sets of yield" on the same Bitcoin simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>:
1.  **Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)**: Projects like Lombard or Solve allow users to stake Bitcoin into Babylon, which is the [[bitcoin_staking_and_restaking | Bitcoin staking protocol]], and in return, receive an LST token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This allows users to do more with their staked Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The yield is typically paid in the LST's native token or points, estimated at 1-2% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
2.  **Babylon Staking**: Babylon is a leading [[bitcoin_staking_and_restaking | Bitcoin staking protocol]] that natively time-locks Bitcoin on the Bitcoin L1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The yield comes from providing Bitcoin's security to other proof-of-stake blockchains like Sui <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This is distinct from [[bitcoin_staking_and_restaking | Bitcoin restaking]], which involves securing additional applications or infrastructure with already staked Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
3.  **L1/L2 Incentives**: Users can mint LST tokens on various Layer 1s or Layer 2s that incentivize the presence of Bitcoin on their chains for use in their DeFi ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This provides a third source of yield from the chosen L1 or L2's native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
4.  **Satlayer Protocol**: Depositing Bitcoin LSTs into Satlayer yields a fourth set of yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

While these strategies offer additional yield, it's crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks. Depositing Bitcoin into these protocols involves giving up custody, and the mechanisms include "slashing" punishments for bad behavior or network attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. The added yield is compensation for this additional risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## Satlayer's Role in Building the Economic Layer

Satlayer is building the economic layer for Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, aiming to use deposited Bitcoin as the best form of collateral for various use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. One key area of focus is **insurance** within crypto, a sector with inherent risks like exploits, hacks, and economic attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

Satlayer offers insurance for lending protocols and their users, providing coverage in case of adverse events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The yield for those providing collateral for this insurance comes from the insurance premiums paid by these protocols or users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This insurance mechanism is seen as a critical step toward unlocking **under-collateralized loans** in crypto, a "holy grail" for building a more full-fledged financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

By pairing this insurance with decentralized ID solutions or on-chain credit scores, it could enable a new product and business line for lending protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The insurance use case can expand to cover other areas like perpetual exchanges and slashing insurance, offering principal and downside protection for yield farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Future Vision: Bitcoin as the Base Layer of Global Finance

In the long term, the vision is for Bitcoin to be the foundation of an entirely new economy and financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This includes:
*   **Global Financial Settlement**: Bitcoin's inherent neutrality makes it a prime candidate for nation-states to accumulate and use for high-value settlement, especially as countries shift away from the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Examples include China and Russia settling oil trades with Bitcoin to avoid US economic influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **[[Algorithmic Stablecoins and Their Importance | Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoins]]**: There's a growing push for [[algorithmic_stablecoins_and_their_importance | stablecoins]] to settle on Bitcoin, and teams are building [[algorithmic_stablecoins_and_their_importance | stablecoins backed by Bitcoin]] through over-collateralization methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. This allows users to put their Bitcoin to work while potentially offering tax benefits by avoiding direct sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Security**: Bitcoin's killer app might not be day-to-day payments (which may remain stablecoin-dominated) but rather providing economic security and settlement for large-value transactions and financial plumbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. For nation-states dealing with billions, maximum security is paramount, and Bitcoin offers the best in class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

The biggest prediction for [[Future of Bitcoin DeFi | Bitcoin DeFi]] in the next 18 months is that it will be one of the largest growth areas, if not *the* largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. This is driven by institutional and nation-state adoption, as these entities will seek to financialize their Bitcoin holdings, demanding financial use cases like borrowing against Bitcoin or settling high-value transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

For this vision to materialize by 2030, the current momentum must continue, despite inevitable "blow-ups" in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. A long-term challenge to consider is quantum resistance for Bitcoin, which teams are already working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Analogy and Conclusion

The concept of Bitcoin becoming programmable collateral can be analogized to **structured financial products** like derivatives and options in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Companies like Satlayer are building the crypto-native versions of these products on top of Bitcoin, enabling a true financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

In essence, Satlayer serves as a key foundation and economic layer for Bitcoin, aiming to rebuild the financial system to be better, more accessible, and fairer, all built on the world's best asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The shift means that Bitcoin is not just a store of value but an active participant in a new global financial order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.

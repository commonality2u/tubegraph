In a recent incident, Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, demonstrated critical leadership during a major security breach where the company's Ethereum cold wallet was hacked for an estimated $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. His approach to managing this [[Crisis Management and Recovery | crisis]] highlighted several key aspects of effective leadership under extreme pressure.

## Initial Reaction and Prioritization
Upon receiving the call from his CFO, Ben Zhou learned the entire wallet, containing about 400,000 to 410,000 Ethereum, was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This amounted to $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Despite initial physical reactions like shakiness and sweating, Zhou took about 10 seconds to "snap out" of it and immediately shifted focus from the monetary loss to understanding the problem and planning the next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

His immediate priorities were:
*   Confirming how the hack happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   Ensuring other wallets and the system were secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   Determining if Bybit's own funds could cover the loss to ensure client assets were safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
    *   Bybit had a stablecoin wallet with $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   The CFO confirmed they could cover the $1.5 billion loss with company money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This was the "biggest relief" for Zhou, knowing clients' funds were safe and he wouldn't face legal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Crisis Management Strategy
Bybit has established incident procedures, categorizing critical events as "P-minus-one" if they impact more than 10,000 clients or cause over $1 million in damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. These procedures include an automated call system to wake up all management, pre-created meeting rooms, and assigned roles for note-taking and commanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Despite these procedures, Zhou noted that a significant amount of "judgment" was required in this unique situation, as typical templates for system outages weren't applicable to a hack of this scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### [[The Importance of Transparent Communication | Transparent Communication]] and PR Management
A critical aspect of Zhou's leadership was his direct and immediate communication strategy. Recognizing that speculation could be disastrous, he aimed to control the narrative by being the sole source of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   He drafted the first tweet himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   He insisted on live streaming with his face on camera, rather than just Twitter Spaces, to build trust and show accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. This stream occurred approximately 40 minutes after the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   The communication aimed to assure the market and prevent a bank run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### Managing a Bank Run and Liquidity
Despite knowing Bybit was one-to-one backed, Zhou's concern was a potential shortage of Ethereum, which clients would likely want to withdraw after the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.
*   He wanted clients to withdraw to prove Bybit's one-to-one backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
*   A key decision was to secure bridge loans of Ethereum from partners, using Bitcoin, USDT, and cash as collateral, rather than buying large amounts on the market and pumping the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   During the bank run, Bybit received 200,000 withdrawal requests within the first hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. The team worked to develop a new software solution to safely transfer 3 billion USDT out of the stuck Genesis Safe wallet to maintain liquidity for withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. Bybit did not halt any withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.

## [[Building resilience and managing stress | Personal Resilience]] and Organizational Investment
Zhou's ability to remain laser-focused and seemingly unstressed during the crisis stems from a personal philosophy: stress arises from knowing what needs to be done but not acting on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Having lived alone since age 12, he learned to find solutions without panicking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

### Investing in Data and Business Intelligence
A critical [[leadership challenges in business growth and hiring | non-negotiable]] for Bybit is its investment in real-time business intelligence systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. These dashboards provide immediate data on margin calculations, wallet levels, and withdrawal trends, enabling Ben to make informed decisions under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>. This allowed Bybit to assess the severity of the bank run (e.g., 10% vs. 100%) and respond effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.

### Investing in the Team
Ben attributes much of Bybit's successful [[Crisis Management and Recovery | crisis response]] to its "world number one team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
*   The team processed approximately 350,000 withdrawal requests within 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
*   This efficiency highlights the effectiveness of the support, approval, review, and risk management teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>.
*   Bybit maintains high standards for hiring, with many candidates not passing probation, ensuring only the most capable individuals are part of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. This dedication to team quality is a core part of Bybit's [[importance_of_culture_and_leadership_in_organizations | culture]].

## Lessons and Future Outlook
Zhou acknowledged regrets, such as not having an in-house Ethereum wallet infrastructure and placing a critical employee (Head of Finance) in a signing role that exposed them to immense personal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. He plans to implement changes to protect key personnel from such burdens in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Bybit plans to launch an industry-first website, hackbounty.com (or hackbounty.crypto), to help future victims track and recover stolen funds by aggregating information on hacker movements and ranking platforms' responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. This initiative aims to leverage blockchain's transparency to combat hacks more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.

Zhou's advice for crypto entrepreneurs facing similar tragic events is to prioritize [[The Importance of Transparent Communication | transparency]] and continuous communication with clients. He believes the market rewards such openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. This event, though unfortunate, has served as a "battle test" for Bybit, proving its resilience and professionalism to both the community and regulators worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.

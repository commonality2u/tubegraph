Investing in the crypto market is profoundly influenced by psychological factors, often leading to common pitfalls and successes. Understanding these human tendencies can help investors navigate the volatile and dynamic landscape of digital assets.

## Emotional Attachment and Conditioned Behavior

A significant psychological aspect of crypto investing is the emotional attachment individuals develop towards their assets. People can become "religiously attached" to an asset, viewing it much like a "football team" or a part of their "culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. This emotional connection is often reinforced when assets have charismatic or "cult-like" leaders who are active on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

This attachment leads to conditioned behavior, where investors believe a "certain action makes money and then it keeps happening until it doesn't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. A prime example is the "buy the dip" mentality. While often profitable, it can lead to devastating losses when an asset is fundamentally unsound, as seen with Luna, where some investors continued to buy the dip even as it approached zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. Even when an asset is "too big to fail" or theoretically able to go to zero, investors might "always find excuses" not to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

To counteract this, it's advised to have the mindset that "all this sh*t can go to zero" and to implement "some form of a stop loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. Conversely, some embrace the [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets | Warren Buffett]] philosophy of buying "when there's blood in the streets," viewing significant crashes as "an amazing opportunity to now reallocate to something you think is going to be strong in the next decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

## The "I Missed It" Psychology and [[Decision making and market success in crypto investing | Opportunity Cost]]

A common psychological trap in crypto is the "I missed it" mentality. When an asset has already "pumped," investors often feel they have "missed it" and consequently "end up not buying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. This often occurs even when it might still be an early stage for the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

It is suggested that to overcome this, one could "just buy like 100 bucks of an asset," which encourages paying more attention and learning about its fundamentals, potentially leading to larger, more informed investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. However, some experienced investors prefer to commit significantly to a position if they are to invest at all, believing small amounts don't align with their risk-reward function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

## Learning from "Blowing Up"

The concept of "blowing up" (experiencing significant financial loss) is often discussed in the context of [[The challenges and rewards of crypto investing | crypto investing]]. While some argue that one needs to "blow up twice" to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>, others believe "once is enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. The experience of blowing up serves as an "educational cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, forcing individuals to "test their limits" and realize that their "intuition misleads" them at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

The key takeaway from "blowing up" is building "self-awareness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.

However, it's crucial that this learning experience is "not fatal," as some individuals in the industry might not recover from catastrophic losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. Blowing up in terms of finances is comparable to a reputation being "disintegrated" after years of building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

## Market Trends and Investor Behavior

Markets can be "countercyclical," meaning that in bear markets or economic depressions, people might gravitate towards "gambling apps" or "quick scams" that offer immediate "dopamine hits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. This can be challenging for builders focusing on [[Impact of technological advancements and market patterns on crypto investments | innovation]] and long-term value, as their efforts might not immediately "flourish" compared to these speculative ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

There's a debate about whether "every coin is a meme coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. While some acknowledge that every coin has a "percentage of memes to it," ranging from 1% to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>, others push back against a nihilistic view where all tokens lack intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

## The Role of Humility and Not Following the Herd

A fundamental principle in [[investing_in_crypto_without_relying_on_luck | crypto investing]] is recognizing that "no one knows what the hell is going to happen in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. Even prolific minds in the space can make incorrect predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. Therefore, cultivating humility and not having an ego is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.

A key warning is "don't always follow consensus" or the "herd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>. While many fund managers might converge on similar bullish or bearish sentiments for certain assets, this consensus doesn't guarantee future performance and can be "really dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>. Over-concentration in an asset that "has consensus already" is particularly challenging because it's hard to have a unique insight when "millions of holders already" exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>.

Investors should focus on what they "have control over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a> and be willing to admit when they are wrong. Operating with "good faith" and having "good intentions" are valued qualities that can lead to forgiveness from the audience, even if predictions are incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:13">[01:43:13]</a>.

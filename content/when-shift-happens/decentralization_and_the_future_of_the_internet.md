The internet, while excellent for moving data, struggles with transferring value and intent across its networks, leading to the rise of large monopolies like Facebook and Google [00:07:10]. These companies act as "judge, jury, and executioner," controlling platforms, fees, and data ownership [00:08:12]. A key goal for the future of the internet is to make it more [[decentralization_and_its_impact_on_social_media | decentralized]], allowing for a more equitable and open digital economy [00:06:32].

## Mist Labs and the Sui Network
Mist Labs, co-founded by Adony Aboden, aims to build platforms and protocols that make the internet more [[decentralization_and_its_challenges | decentralized]] [00:00:30]. Their primary project, the Sui Network, is a layer-one blockchain and smart contract platform designed to make digital asset ownership fast, secure, and accessible [00:00:17]. Sui provides a simple infrastructure to reduce the cost and complexity of sending money or value across the internet, making it easier than ever before [00:01:05].

The vision for Sui is to create a "Swiss army knife" of infrastructure [01:04:49]. Its requirements include:
*   **Developer Experience**: Developers should be able to build compelling applications within three to four days, without needing to be smart contract experts [01:07:48].
*   **Scalability**: The infrastructure should handle scale without fees increasing, congestion, or transactions failing, unlike many current crypto platforms [01:08:03]. Sui aims for infinite scalability by adding more nodes, ensuring gas fees don't spike [01:09:08].
*   **Performance**: Transactions on Sui finalize within 600 milliseconds, making it faster than tapping a Visa card [01:09:10].

## The Failure of Facebook's Libra Project
Adony Aboden was part of the Facebook team working on Libra, an ambitious project aiming to create a blockchain run by a consortium of over 20 organizations with a future goal of [[decentralization_vs_centralization_in_crypto_platforms | decentralization]] [00:44:50]. The core mission was to make sending money as easy as sending an email [00:45:09].

However, the Libra project did not succeed primarily because the founding company, Facebook, had lost public trust due to past issues with public data [00:47:50]. Despite efforts to involve multiple parties and make it democratic, the perception of Facebook being central to the project could not be shaken [00:48:19].

The main concern for governments was the immense power a "Bank of Facebook" would wield if two billion people instantly had accounts, posing a potential threat to nation-states [00:48:37]. While Zuckerberg had the entrepreneurial spirit to attempt such a project, a step-by-step approach, perhaps starting with a simple tokenized US dollar, might have been more successful [00:47:06]. The issue wasn't the technology itself, but the messenger [00:47:41].

## The Need for Decentralized Infrastructure
The current internet creates monopolies because it lacks a "democratization layer for coordinating assets" [00:06:38]. A [[decentralization_and_its_impact_on_social_media | decentralized]] layer would enable new payment, storage, and social media businesses without a single company acting as "judge, jury, and executioner" [00:08:00]. This would prevent entities from dictating fees or data ownership [00:08:18].

Moving forward, the internet needs:
*   **Decentralized Coordination of Assets**: Addressed by Sui Network, which facilitates the exchange of value [00:56:38].
*   **Decentralized Storage**: Addressed by Warus protocol, a new business-fault-tolerant storage layer for mass use [00:56:45]. This allows applications to be fully [[the_role_of_decentralization_in_blockchain_security | decentralized]] and offers security benefits by removing single points of failure like DNS hacks [01:17:34].
*   **Decentralized Networking Layer**: This is crucial to prevent traffic manipulation or forced compliance from central authorities [00:56:57].

## Bitcoin and Crypto in the Financial System
Bitcoin is seen as the embodiment of a financial system the people deserve but do not have [00:58:57]. Unlike traditional banks where deposits might not truly belong to the account holder during bail-ins, or where government policies can dilute currency value, Bitcoin offers:
*   **No Inflation**: The amount of Bitcoin is fixed, preventing dilution of value [01:00:21].
*   **Transparency and Proof of Ownership**: Bitcoin's ledger is visible, allowing users to prove ownership [01:00:27].
*   **[[decentralization_and_the_current_financial_system | Decentralization]]**: No single body can control or make rules about Bitcoin assets [01:00:35].

Adony Aboden believes that crypto, particularly new layer-one solutions like Sui, will enable mass adoption where users benefit from a better rail without necessarily knowing they are using crypto [01:02:46].

## Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto
Historically, crypto has largely "undelivered" on its promises due to a lack of expressive developer platforms and compelling applications [01:10:03]. Many early crypto games were essentially "spreadsheets turned into games," and the industry has often been seen as a "great casino" focused on extracting value rather than providing tangible benefits for the mass consumer [01:01:33].

Key challenges in crypto include:
*   **Slow and Expensive Transactions**: Older platforms like Ethereum are slow and costly, discouraging real business building [01:12:06].
*   **Security Vulnerabilities**: Complex rules around assets in some blockchains lead to hacks, making it difficult to build trusted systems [01:11:01].
*   **Poor Developer Experience**: Some platforms are difficult to learn and build on, limiting innovation [01:12:07].

New layer-one blockchains are necessary because existing ones are largely unscalable, lack good developer experiences, and are not robust enough for infrastructure demands [01:13:37]. Sui, for example, boasts zero downtime and no fee spikes since its launch, even during periods of high transaction volume [01:14:07]. This highlights a shift towards building highly scalable and reliable infrastructure that can compete with traditional web2 services [01:14:38].

## The "Switzerland" Analogy for Decentralization
The concept of Switzerland's neutrality resonates with the ideology of [[decentralization_and_its_challenges | decentralization]] [00:55:07]. Just as Switzerland provides a neutral platform for business, decentralized infrastructure aims to be a neutral layer where rules are clear, and participation is a choice [00:56:17].

This contrasts sharply with "Enterprise blockchains," which often fail because they introduce boot-strapping issues and the desire for ownership and control over rules by individual entities [00:55:28]. The goal is to build public infrastructure where rules are set for everyone to accept, fostering an open and fair environment [00:56:04].

## Government Power and Decentralization
The government's ability to shut down projects like Libra and pursue centralized tech companies like Telegram and TikTok demonstrates their significant power over private enterprise and user data [00:51:50]. This highlights the need for [[advantages_and_challenges_of_deploying_decentralized_infrastructure | decentralized infrastructure]] that can operate independently of single-party demands [00:54:00]. This democratic infrastructure is designed to make it harder for external forces to control or censor applications, ensuring fairness for consumers [00:53:51].

## Conclusion
The future of the internet lies in a multi-layered approach to [[decentralization_and_its_challenges | decentralization]], moving beyond just coordinating assets to also decentralize storage and networking [00:57:17]. The ultimate goal is to build a layer of the internet that allows everyone to participate in commerce, competing with the likes of Google, Amazon, and Alibaba, but on a neutral, open, and democratized playing field [00:57:32].

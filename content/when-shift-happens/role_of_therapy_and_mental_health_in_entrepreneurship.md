Joe McCann, CEO and CIO at Asymmetric, a top-performing hedge fund globally in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, emphasizes the critical role of mental health and therapy in the demanding world of entrepreneurship and trading. His personal experiences highlight how psychological well-being is as crucial as business acumen for sustained success.

## The Personal Journey: From Chronic Insomnia to Mental Clarity

McCann shares his [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | personal experiences]] with chronic insomnia, which he attributes to the intense demands of Silicon Valley startup culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. His insomnia manifested as difficulty falling asleep, stemming from his body associating his bed with work and stress rather than rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. He learned that the bed should be exclusively for sleep and sex, not for working, watching TV, or reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

To overcome this, McCann underwent a year of therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The learned solution involved:
*   Standing up and watching TV if he started to doze off on the couch, retraining his body that the couch was not for sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   Immediately going to bed the second he felt tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   Adopting practices like using white noise, blackout shades, a sleeping mask, and not eating a few hours before bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   Investing in an Eight Sleep cover, which uses AI models to optimize sleep temperature and wake the body gently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

These practices led to "some of the best recovery and sleep ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Despite the volatile crypto markets, he has not slipped back into chronic insomnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

## Therapy as a "Personal Trainer for the Brain"

McCann is a strong advocate for therapy, likening a therapist to a "personal trainer for your brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. He believes that just as people exercise for physical fitness, they should focus on training their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. He sees a therapist as essential for mental fitness, offering guidance that is difficult to achieve alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. For McCann, therapy fundamentally changed his perspective and has served him well for the past six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## The Impact of Childhood Trauma on Entrepreneurial Drive

Joe McCann was raised by a single mother with four boys, moving over a dozen times for his mother's job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. While recognizing that such a "level of destabilization is not healthy," he also acknowledges that it "built a lot of character" for him and his brothers, making them highly adaptable to almost any environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

This upbringing, particularly growing up without a father, created [[personal_reflections_on_entrepreneurship_and_mindset | childhood trauma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. McCann references philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, noting that "if a man is born without a father he creates one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This inner child trauma needs to be addressed through various means like therapy, holotropic breathing, psychedelics, or spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The trauma also cultivated a "pretty strong chip on your shoulder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> and a lack of fear of failure or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. McCann realized that the external pursuit of fulfillment (like raising a Series B for his company NodeSource and receiving accolades) never truly satisfied this inner void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Acknowledging this limitation is crucial for managing stress and redirecting focus toward genuine interests, rather than blindly chasing societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This realization prompted his first engagement with psychotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Managing Emotions in High-Stakes Environments

In trading and entrepreneurship, the ability to manage emotions is paramount. McCann highlights the human tendency toward loss aversion, where people "hate losing more than we enjoy winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. This emotional bias often leads investors to justify staying in losing positions, clinging to the hope of a rebound rather than acknowledging a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>. His mantra: "There's nothing wrong with being wrong, staying wrong is a sin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.

McCann advocates for:
*   **Knowing your exit strategy in advance:** For any trade, one should define both the profit-taking point and the stop-loss level before entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>. This removes emotion from the decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>.
*   **Detaching from emotion:** When feeling panic or euphoria during market volatility, experienced traders learn to observe these emotions without being controlled by them. This allows for rational action, such as rebalancing a portfolio during a market panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.
*   **Recognizing "Flow State" and "Being on Tilt":** Traders develop a "flow state" where they are in rhythm with the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. It's crucial to recognize when one is "out of the flow state" or "on tilt" (overtrading) and step away to reset, even if it means not trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.
*   **"Paying the Gods":** A superstitious but practical concept in trading is to take some profits ("pay the gods") when a trade is doing well, even if it could go higher. This prevents giving back all gains in a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>.

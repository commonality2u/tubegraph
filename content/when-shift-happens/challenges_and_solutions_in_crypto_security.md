The crypto industry, despite its rapid growth, faces significant [[challenges_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges]], particularly in the realm of security. Recent events, such as the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit's Ethereum cold wallet, highlight the constant need for robust security measures and transparent crisis management.

## The Bybit Security Incident

On a Friday night, Bybit's CFO informed CEO Ben Zhou of a hack, initially believing it was 30,000 Ethereum [00:00:00], but it quickly became apparent that the entire wallet, containing approximately 400,000 Ethereum, was compromised [00:10:06]. This amounted to an estimated $1.5 billion [00:00:18]. This incident exposed a major security vulnerability in Bybit's cold storage solution, specifically with their third-party Genesis Safe wallet for Ethereum [00:11:51], which involved online signing through a browser [00:57:55].

### Immediate Response and Crisis Management
Upon realizing the scale of the hack, Ben Zhou's immediate priority was to confirm if other wallets were secure and if Bybit's own funds could cover the loss [00:12:21]. This quick assessment was crucial to ensure client assets were safe and to prevent a potential bank run [00:12:48].

Bybit initiated a P-minus-one (P-1) procedure, an internal protocol for very critical incidents impacting more than 10,000 clients or causing over $1 million in damage [00:14:09]. This procedure automatically alerts management, sets up communication channels, and assigns roles for crisis response [00:14:29]. Bybit conducts monthly drills for P-1 incidents, though none had ever been as large as a hack [00:13:52], [00:15:08].

## Leadership and Transparency in Crisis
Ben Zhou emphasized the importance of transparency and direct communication during the crisis [00:20:20]. He decided to act as the primary PR representative, directly tweeting updates and conducting live streams to inform the public and quell speculation [00:23:09]. He insisted on showing his face during streams, believing it would build trust that he was telling the truth [00:24:16].

Bybit's internal systems, including real-time dashboards for margin calculation, wallet levels, and withdrawal predictions, allowed for informed decision-making under immense pressure [00:44:57]. This robust business intelligence infrastructure, which many companies lack, enabled Bybit to keep withdrawals open and process 350,000 requests within 12 hours, unlike many other exchanges that stop withdrawals after a hack [00:43:40], [00:48:18].

Zhou attributed his ability to remain focused to past experiences of living independently from a young age, which taught him to find solutions without panicking [00:20:52]. His primary concern was to ensure the company's long-term survival and continued trust from clients and regulators [00:20:09].

## Lessons Learned and Future Security Measures
The incident highlighted several critical areas for improvement in Bybit's security posture:
*   **In-house Solutions:** The biggest lesson was the need to build all critical security infrastructure, especially for hot and cold wallets, in-house [00:57:13]. Bybit was larger than the third-party safe company it used, making it a target for hackers trying to penetrate the third party to reach Bybit [00:59:45].
*   **Wallet Splitting:** Bybit plans to split wallets to ensure that a breach of one wallet does not severely impact the entire exchange [00:57:19].
*   **Enhanced Cold Storage:** Future solutions will focus on truly cold environments for asset signing, where all operations happen offline, similar to how Bybit's Bitcoin cold wallets operate securely [00:58:07]. The current Ethereum solution, which allowed online signing, was a vulnerability [01:03:59].
*   **Protecting Key Personnel:** A personal regret for Zhou was involving his Head of Finance in the signing process, exposing him to immense pressure and potential guilt despite not being at fault [01:15:11]. Future measures will ensure that highly critical roles are not part of such processes [01:17:01].

## Industry-Wide [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_crypto | Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto]]
The Bybit hack, while unfortunate, demonstrated a significant maturation of the crypto industry's response to security breaches compared to past events like the FTX collapse [01:12:01]. The ability to resolve the crisis within three days and maintain open withdrawals showed resilience.

The incident also reignites the debate around self-custody. While individuals are advised "not your keys, not your coin," exchanges, even with advanced security, remain prime targets [00:59:07]. The core challenge for the industry lies in the fact that large centralized entities are massive targets for sophisticated attackers, making self-reliance on security paramount [01:00:02], [01:01:10].

### HackBounty.com: A Community Solution to Hacking
To address the ongoing problem of stolen funds and help other victims, Bybit is launching HackBounty.com (or HackBounty.crypto) [01:22:05], [01:24:06]. This platform aims to:
*   **Aggregate Information:** Provide a centralized hub for victims to track stolen funds, displaying endpoints where money becomes untraceable (mixers, bridges, small exchanges) [01:21:01].
*   **Rate Responsiveness:** Show how quickly exchanges and other entities respond to requests for help in freezing or tracing funds, creating a ranking of "good" and "bad" actors in the industry [01:21:19].
*   **Incentivize Bounty Hunters:** Allow anyone to become a "bounty hunter" by helping trace funds, registering them as the tracker for that specific line of movement [01:22:17].
*   **Promote Collaboration:** Encourage exchanges to cooperate by responding quickly to avoid being listed as unhelpful, especially given regulatory concerns about facilitating sanctioned funds [01:23:12].

This initiative leverages blockchain's transparency to solve a blockchain problem, aiming to make it harder for hackers to launder funds and to foster greater cooperation across the industry to combat these [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges and risks]].

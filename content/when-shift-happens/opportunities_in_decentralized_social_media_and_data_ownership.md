The evolution of the internet has led to a significant shift from a decentralized vision to one dominated by centralized platforms. This centralization has created new opportunities in the realm of [[decentralization_and_its_impact_on_social_media | decentralized]] social media and data ownership, particularly within Web3, which aims to address the limitations of Web2 platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## Problems with Centralized (Web2) Social Media

In the Web2 era, platforms like Facebook and Twitter centralize user data, leading to several issues:
*   **Lack of Portability and Interoperability** User data is locked within a platform's database, making it impossible for users to move their data between services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.
*   **Limited User Monetization** Platforms profit from user-generated content and data through advertising, while users receive little to no direct compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
*   **Influencer Hostage Situation** Influencers, who build large followings, are at the mercy of platform policies; a platform can remove them, leading to a loss of their audience and revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>.
*   **Censorship and Control** Centralized entities can arbitrarily decide what content is allowed or remove users, impacting free expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   **Data Security Risks** User data is vulnerable to hacks or misuse by centralized platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

## Decentralized Social Media: The Web3 Solution

[[decentralization_and_its_impact_on_social_media | Decentralized]] social media in Web3 presents an opportunity to solve these problems by returning control and ownership to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. The core premise is that users should own their data, giving them the ability to port, share, and monetize it as they see fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

### Key Components

*   **Data Ownership:** Users directly own their personal data, which is stored on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
*   **Portability & Interoperability:** Data can be easily moved between different Web3 applications, fostering a more interconnected digital experience. This is enabled by underlying social graph protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Users can earn revenue from the content they generate and even from personalized advertising, rather than platforms taking the "lion's share" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.

### Identity in Web3 Social Media

Identity is a foundational element in Web3 social media. A user's wallet becomes a key part of their digital identity, enabling personalized experiences while allowing for pseudonymity or the creation of new wallets for privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. Tools like the Bastion wallet, which supports account abstraction, allow users to create wallets on the spot with existing Web2 accounts (e.g., Google, email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.

### Advertising in the Decentralized Model

Decentralized advertising networks, such as Ad Bazar being developed by the Bizan team, propose a new model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. This model can:
*   **Leverage Wallet Data:** Advertisements can be tailored based on public information from a user's wallet, such as NFTs or gaming tokens, without infringing on privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.
*   **Empower Users as Publishers:** Users can earn money directly from viewing or hosting advertisements, bypassing centralized intermediaries that typically capture most of the revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   **User Control:** Users have the choice to disclose their information or use different wallets to maintain privacy, giving them control over their data exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

### User Experience Considerations

While the conceptual advantages are clear, Web3 social media still faces challenges in user experience. Centralized platforms are generally "smoother" and faster due to their database architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. Web3 applications, which connect with blockchains and involve smart contracts, may inherently have slight delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. However, the focus is on providing a "different experience" based on data control and monetization, even if speed is not immediately superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

## Prominent Projects

*   **Bizan Network:** A Web3 social network for creatives, and an investor in [[future_of_digital_ownership_and_capitalism | Bizan]], aims to help users share, monetize, and control their data using decentralized tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
*   **Lens Protocol:** Described as an "underlying protocol of the future of social media," Lens Protocol provides a social graph for Web3 applications, enabling data portability and interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. It functions as a layer under social media platforms, akin to how iOS or Android function for decentralized applications, ensuring that users retain ownership and control over their data across different applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Lens Protocol is being built on Polygon, an L2 solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. The team behind Lens Protocol also developed Aave, a successful [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.

These innovations in decentralized social media and data ownership represent significant [[opportunities_in_crypto_and_the_role_of_timing_and_social_media_influence | opportunities in crypto]] for entrepreneurs and users alike, promising a future where individuals have greater control over their digital lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

Game theory, at its core, involves strategic interaction where outcomes depend on the choices of multiple independent, strategic individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. It's not a one-person game; other players are involved, thinking strategically about their own goals and trying to achieve their desired utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. To succeed, one must predict what others will do and consider their "reaction function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

## Game Theory in Dating

Understanding game theory is crucial in dating, as it's clearly not a one-player game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

### Evolutionary Foundations
To truly grasp the game theory of dating, it's essential to study [[role_of_evolutionary_psychology_in_human_behavior | evolutionary psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Human genes and intuition are shaped by millennia of ancestors striving to survive and procreate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

*   **Women's Strategy**: Women have a strong intuition to discern genuine value from fakes, which is vital for selecting a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Men's Strategy**: Men, due to the low "cost" of sperm, often face a reality where many are "expendable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. If one "alpha male" displays superior genes and value, women are predisposed to be attracted to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Studies, like those on OK Cupid, show that women perceive most men as "way below average," focusing their attention on a select few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### Consequences for Men
This dynamic can lead to a significant number of unhappy men who struggle to get attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Social media further exacerbates this, making it easier for "alpha males" to display their power to many women, leading to a disparity where some men are dating hundreds of women, while many others struggle to find a girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. However, social media displays can also be easily faked, making it difficult for women to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

### Changing Dynamics and Desires
Women's preferences evolve with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>:
*   **Early 20s**: They often seek the "pretty boy," popular, fun type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Approaching 30s**: As they consider children, the dynamic shifts, and they prioritize older, accomplished men with established careers, money, and wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This represents the most interesting game theory in mating dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

For men, life gets easier in the late 20s and early 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Once a man starts achieving things and has his life together, he becomes naturally attractive to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

What women generally want in a partner:
*   A successful man who treats them well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.
*   **Success Defined**: Can be money-centric (linking back to ancestors' need for resource gatherers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   **Other Values**: Physical health markers or artistic creativity (for offspring survival) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

For "nerdy" individuals in crypto, a good starting point is focusing on getting resources, which is part of the puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. However, some who acquire resources may lack social skills or are primarily interested in short-term relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

### Age Gap and Long-term Relationships
A healthy age gap between men and women, around five years, is suggested to ensure both partners can survive together for more years, with the man being slightly older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. Hormones drive much human behavior, especially regarding procreation and bonding with children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. However, after 3-5 years, these bonds can calm, leading to a high divorce rate (nearly 60%) if the partnership isn't strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Many unhappy couples stay together due to societal pressures, children, habits, or financial dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. If a woman is financially dependent, a man may naturally start treating her badly, as he takes her for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

## Personal Application of Game Theory: Life's Journey

### The "Nice Guy" Trajectory
Starting as a "nice guy" often means "finishing last" in dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. Being overly sensitive and consistently giving gifts and romantic gestures can lead women to lose attraction, even if they retain respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. An "alpha male" archetype, in contrast, doesn't always act "nice" but instead "grabs" what's there and protects, which can be seen as attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>. The ideal is to balance these traits, learning to mellow out from either extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. A common female fantasy is to "tame the wild animal" – a powerful but "bad" person they can domesticate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Personal Challenges
A significant personal transformation for Jordy involved a period of depression after a breakup at age 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. His [[player_identity_and_its_importance_in_gaming | self-identity]] was tied to the relationship, leading to a "negative spiral" akin to a crypto liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. His health declined, and as a professional poker player, his financial life suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. He played high-stakes games irresponsibly, leading to further losses, a form of "revenge trading" in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>.

A near-fatal car crash served as a "wake-up call," emphasizing the desperate need for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>. Despite intelligence, deep mental health issues often require outside help, as logical analysis can be difficult when emotionally compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:11]</a>. Jordy learned to be more systematic and logical later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>. His primary challenge was [[navigating_relationships_and_personal_values_in_pursuit_of_success | controlling his ego]], which was full of insecurities and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>.

He adopted the concept of a "spirit animal," identifying with a black dragon – powerful, independent, not inherently good or bad, and only retaliating if provoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>. This helped him find balance and direct his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>.

### The Role of Ego and Insecurity
Jordy admits his self-development was largely individual due to a childhood where he had to be an adult early on after his parents' divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>. This created a habit of fighting through difficulties alone, believing it builds greater resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>.

Richard W. said "the ego is the single biggest obstruction to the achievement of anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:00">[28:27:00]</a>. Jordy agrees, noting his life changed dramatically once his ego was under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>. Ego is often a defense mechanism built from tough life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>. It hinders effective communication in relationships and business, often leading to startup failures due to "founder problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>.

Regarding toxic relationships, including family, Jordy advocates for cutting ties if they are unhealthy, even if one can understand the other person's trauma or intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:18:00">[49:18:00]</a>. This fosters personal health and removes psychological burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>.

### [[player_identity_and_its_importance_in_gaming | Player Identity]] and Purpose
For Jordy, having children became a fundamental, organic part of his being, realizing he wouldn't want to deny himself the drive to procreate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>. The meaning of life, he concludes, is to make the next generation better, providing a path for the future of humanity to evolve and potentially find answers to life's grand questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>. This is about leaving a legacy of progress, not just money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>. He compares it to chess: one cannot calculate all moves to the end, but can only play a good move on the board, trusting in the development of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>.

Money, for him, *has* increased happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>. However, getting "too rich too quickly" can be detrimental, leading to a loss of purpose and disconnection from reality, as seen in some young crypto billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>. True satisfaction comes from achieving difficult things that have a positive impact on the world and fostering personal growth, rather than fixed monetary targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Game Theory in Markets: Poker to Crypto

Jordy's [[financial_independence_and_careers_in_poker_and_trading | career path]] from poker to crypto trading is a testament to applying game theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Poker as a Foundation
Poker provided financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">[51:03:00]</a>. Success in poker, like trading, comes from a process-oriented approach, focusing on expected value, probabilities, and decision quality, rather than immediate wins or losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Jordy still plays high-stakes poker at the World Series of Poker, using lessons learned at the table to inform his trading and business decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:13:00">[52:13:00]</a>.

Gambling, however, can be dangerous due to addiction and poor decision-making when emotions take over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:57:00">[55:57:00]</a>. Humans are not adapted to games of chance; superstitions often lead people to believe they can influence random outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:44:00">[59:44:00]</a>.

### Transition to Trading
Jordy initially resisted trading due to its similarity to poker but eventually succumbed to the "universe's call" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. He opted for systematic trading (algorithms) for its scalability, despite lacking coding experience, because it removes the time-for-money exchange of discretionary trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>. His unique niche was combining intuition with systematic analysis, allowing him to identify profit-making opportunities (like sizing up algorithms) that pure quants might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

After making over a million dollars a year, he left to start his own firm, Selini Capital, driven by a desire for growth, better culture, and the belief he could combine organizational leadership with trading acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. He took this risk because he had enough money to not be in "survival mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

### The "Million Dollar Trade"
Jordy discovered a unique manual futures trade, available quarterly, that no one else could execute as effectively due to its reliance on piecing together information from multiple sources and adapting to unique, unpredictable market situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. This trade could generate $1 million in one week, requiring 5 days of constant monitoring, minimal sleep, and intense focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>. This involved destroying his health and operating like a robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. He felt a "guilt" not to extract this value, seeing it as a necessary sacrifice for business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>.

Despite the financial gain, there's a significant [[worklife_balance_and_risktaking_in_entrepreneurship | cost to health and life quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>. Only recently has he decided that his time and a week of his life are worth more than a million dollars, reflecting a shift in his perception of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

### [[understanding_money_and_economic_systems | Understanding Money]] and Crypto Value
Jordy critically analyzes value in crypto, distinguishing between cash flow-backed assets and those with "monetary premium" value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. He argues that many people, even in traditional finance, poorly understand what money truly means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44">[01:26:44]</a>. He equates the widespread acceptance of highly concentrated crypto assets (like Solana) to a form of modern slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>. If society agrees a coin is worth billions, it effectively means the general population is willing to work for the few individuals who hold most of the supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. He believes this is not sustainable for assets like Solana, given its highly concentrated initial distribution, unlike Bitcoin, which has a more "neutral" origin story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

## Future of Humanity and AI

Jordy believes the human species is at a critical juncture, particularly with the rapid advancement of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>.

### The Rise of AI
The exponential growth of AI means that by the end of the decade, life will change fundamentally in ways many people are unprepared for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. If Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) can perform much of human work, it could give immense power to those who control it, creating "superhumans" and leading to extreme imbalances between powerful individuals and the rest of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### Ethical Dilemmas and Societal Impact
This raises significant ethical questions beyond simple solutions like Universal Basic Income (UBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. The gap between the "powerful" and "base" people could become so vast that it dwarfs current capitalist disparities, potentially making some human lives akin to pets in terms of consciousness and ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

The progress of technology is likely inevitable, with national intelligence agencies already getting involved, turning AI development into a national security issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This raises questions about the value of human life if one cannot contribute to a capitalist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The unprecedented wealth created by AI advancements will inevitably sway politicians and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

Jordy predicts the US government will likely gain significant control over AI due to where most development is currently happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. He fears a future where the current societal discontent and wealth imbalances will worsen, potentially leading to a new form of power dynamic akin to a Russia-USSR/US split, but with much higher stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Jordy's journey highlights the continuous application of game theory to life: understanding oneself, others, and evolving strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. It’s about personal growth, striving for positive impact, and recognizing that [[the_evolution_of_the_gaming_industry_through_blockchain | progress]] and purpose are continuous, rather than fixed targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

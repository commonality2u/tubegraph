Astroport is an upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) designed for the [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | Terra ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It functions as a trustless Automated Market Maker (AMM) that allows users to trade tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Astroport aims to significantly improve upon existing AMMs and DEXes within the [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | Terra ecosystem]] by offering multiple pool types (constant product and stable swap) in a single protocol for better pricing and trade efficiency, advanced charting and analytics, dual token rewards for liquidity providers (LPs), and tiered governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The project is built on the Cosmos SDK, allowing for potential integration with Wormhole v2 and other interoperability protocols to expand its reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Astro Token Launch and Allocations

The launch of Astroport is imminent, and upon going live, it will be governed by ASTRO token holders across the [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | Terra ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. At launch, 110 million ASTRO governance tokens will be in circulation out of a total supply of one billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. These tokens will be distributed to three main groups:
1.  **Airdrop** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
2.  **Phase One Lockdrop** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
3.  **Phase Two ASTRO-UST Bootstrapping Pool** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>

## Astro Airdrop

The Astro airdrop is designed to distribute ASTRO governance tokens to active [[introduction_to_terra_and_stablecoins | Terra]] supporters and users, often referred to as "T5 Chads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A total of 25 million ASTRO tokens are allocated for this airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Eligibility for Airdrop
The airdrop targets two primary groups based on a snapshot taken on September 9, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>:
*   **[[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] Stakers**: 12.5 million ASTRO tokens are allocated to users who had [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]] staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **TerraSwap Liquidity Providers (LPs)**: 12.5 million ASTRO tokens are allocated to users who had liquidity in TerraSwap pools with more than $1 million USD worth of liquidity, specifically concerning the [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]]-UST pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Airdrop recipients will have the option to pre-claim and lock their ASTRO tokens into the ASTRO-UST liquidity bootstrapping pool to receive additional ASTRO tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Phase One: The Lockdrop

The lockdrop mechanism allows users to migrate their liquidity from TerraSwap to Astroport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. A total of 75 million ASTRO tokens are distributed in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

*   **Supported Tokens**: The lockdrop supports various tokens, including [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]], Anchor, b[[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]], Mirror, Orion, Stt, Mine, Apollo, Valkyrie, and Nexus Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The distribution percentages vary, with [[lunas_cryptocurrency_and_token_dynamics | Luna]]-UST having the largest percentage and Nexus having the smallest at three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Timeline**: Phase One runs from December 6th to December 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   During the first five days, TerraSwap LPs can migrate their liquidity to Astroport and receive a one-time ASTRO distribution when the product launches on December 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   After four days, up to 50% of the migrated liquidity can be withdrawn from Astroport. On the last day of Phase One, the maximum withdrawal amount reduces to zero percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Phase Two: ASTRO-UST Bootstrapping Pool

Phase Two focuses on establishing the initial liquidity for the ASTRO token and serving as a price discovery period for ASTRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Users can lock ASTRO (received from the airdrop or Phase One) and/or UST into the ASTRO-UST liquidity bootstrap pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. A total of 10 million ASTRO tokens are distributed in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

*   **Timeline**: Users have four days to add assets, with the last day to add ASTRO and/or UST being three days prior to launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   Two days prior to launch, it's the final opportunity to withdraw up to 50% of migrated liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
    *   On the final day to withdraw any UST from Astroport, up to 50% can be withdrawn at the start of the day, with the amount falling linearly to zero percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Deposits**: ASTRO is not live or tradable during Phase Two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Any ASTRO deposited must come from ASTRO credits received in Phase One or pre-claimed airdrop ASTRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   Users can commit ASTRO and UST in any configuration (e.g., both, just ASTRO, or just UST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    *   Any single-sided deposits will be converted into a 50/50 share of ASTRO-UST LP tokens when the pool closes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This means redeeming LP tokens will return a combination of ASTRO and UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
    *   Deposited ASTRO tokens cannot be withdrawn during Phase Two; users must wait until their lock expires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   Single-sided deposits directly affect the pool's ratio and the implied price of ASTRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Allocation**: Your ASTRO allocation in Phase Two is determined by the total percentage of the pool you own when the snapshot is taken at the end of the phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. There is no advantage to being the first to deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## Post-Launch Incentives

After Astroport's launch, some projects may award third-party governance tokens (e.g., Anchor or Mirror) to liquidity locked in Astroport's lockdrop if those projects choose to utilize Astroport's "Astro Generators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Astro Generators are designed to distribute dual rewards, meaning users could earn yield in kind along with a supplementary yield in a governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

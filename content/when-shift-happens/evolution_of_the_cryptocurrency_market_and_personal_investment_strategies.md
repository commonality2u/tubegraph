Cha_Wong, a founding partner of Alliance DAO and founding head of product at Messari, shares his insights on the evolution of the cryptocurrency market and his personal [[Investment strategies in cryptocurrency | investment strategies]]. His mission with Alliance DAO is to "find the best founders in crypto and help them build products that people love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

## Entry into Crypto and Early Market Volatility

Wong entered the crypto market in 2012, drawn by its extreme volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. He notes that the market volatility back then was significantly higher than what is seen today, with Bitcoin experiencing more than 50% drops in a single day around 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. His "moment of magic" and understanding of crypto's value proposition came when $20,000 of his net worth got stuck in the traditional banking system for half a year while trying to arbitrage between offshore betting platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This experience made him realize the necessity of Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. He went "all in" on crypto in 2017 at the peak of the bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, both personally and professionally by building Messari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

Wong highlights the importance of timing; entering at the peak of a bear market, like 2011 or 2014, might have led him to give up on crypto for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

## Market Cycles and Recognizing Patterns

Wong emphasizes the significance of recognizing patterns in the crypto market. He applies lessons from past crises to current situations:
*   **The DAO Hack (2016):** The exploit of a dApp built on Ethereum led to a theft of 10-20% of Ethereum's total supply, causing the community and even co-founders to split (e.g., Charles Hoskinson leaving to create Ethereum Classic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Despite the turmoil, a small group of passionate developers continued building on Ethereum, which signaled its long-term viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin Civil War / SegWit Drama (2017):** Similar to the DAO hack, this event caused a community split. However, the Bitcoin core community maintained a critical mass of believers, ensuring its survival over other factions like Bitcoin Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   **Solana Post-FTX Collapse (2022):** Wong saw parallels between the FTX collapse and the DAO hack. Even as Solana crashed to $8, he observed a dedicated "small handful" of serious dApp developers and entrepreneurs who remained passionate and continued building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. This "critical mass" of believers gave him conviction that Solana would recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

He likens crypto networks (Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin) to "living beings" that survive as long as they maintain a critical mass of people involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. This pattern also applies to products and startups: those that survive lows often have a dedicated "handful of users that really love their products" and continue to iterate, eventually reaching "escape velocity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. He cites Tensor, an NFT marketplace, as an example of a product that experienced years of no growth but persevered due to a small base of "power users," eventually finding success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

Crypto products often exhibit "staircase" growth trajectories—periods of growth followed by long flat periods, rather than the monotonic, exponential growth seen in Web2 products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. This is observed in exchanges like Coinbase and even non-speculative products like Farcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies in the crypto market | Investment Strategies in the Crypto Market]]

Wong emphasizes the importance of **contrarian thinking** for great investors and founders. The ability to question consensus and identify incorrect prevailing ideas is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. For founders, building a startup fundamentally involves "figuring out an insight about the market about the users that no one really understands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

### Developing Judgment
Judgment, defined as "knowing the long-term consequence of your actions," is developed by "taking actions" and "getting wrecked by the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. He quotes, "There's two types of investors: those who are humble and those who will be humbled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

### Trading vs. Investing
Wong believes both short-term trading and long-term investing can be successful, depending on an individual's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. Short-term trading is effective for smaller capital due to faster compounding, while long-term investing is necessary for larger capital bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Both approaches require studying history and identifying patterns. Short-term trading provides quicker feedback, whereas long-term investing requires studying the strategies and philosophies of successful investors like Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.

### Growth Investing in Crypto
Wong suggests that Charlie Munger's philosophy—"it's far better to invest in great companies at fair value than to invest in fair companies at a low value"—applies well to crypto. This approach favors "growth investing" over traditional "value investing," focusing on protocols or tokens that demonstrate consistent on-chain transaction growth, Total Value Locked (TVL), or narrative attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. He highlights that money follows attention and excitement about the future, rather than just current fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

### Importance of Using Products
A significant "alpha" for crypto investors and entrepreneurs is to **actively try the products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. While many crypto products can be "janky," experiencing the "magic" of a product (like sending the first Bitcoin transaction, using DeFi in DeFi summer, or experiencing Solana's smooth, low-fee transactions) provides invaluable insight that passive observation (e.g., scrolling Crypto Twitter) cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

## Personal Portfolio and Market Outlook

Wong's personal crypto portfolio is heavily weighted in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. He also engages in short-term narrative trading, exemplified by his early entry into meme coins like WIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. His core long-term positions are based on tokens with low supply overhang and genuine user traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

He is "overweight Bitcoin and Solana" compared to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. He perceives Ethereum as overvalued relative to Solana based on objective metrics and, more importantly, because "more and more entrepreneurs are going to Solana than on Ethereum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. Bitcoin's strength lies in its "pure product market fit" as the "best store of value uncensorable store value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

Wong attempts to play market cycles but acknowledges the difficulty of selling at the exact peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. He has improved his timing over cycles, but his strategy is to sell only 20-30% at the top to avoid missing upside, aiming to double his position at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. His first cycle involved holding only Bitcoin, while in later cycles, he selectively sold "shitcoins" into fiat during bull markets, recognizing that only Bitcoin and Ethereum were "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.

He believes it is "almost impossible" to outperform a mix of Bitcoin, Solana, and Coinbase stock in the current cycle, primarily due to the **explosion of new tokens** and a **lack of sufficient new money injected into the system** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. He states that "alt seasons" typically require both "not a ton of alt tokens" and "a ton of money," conditions that are not met in the current market, as thousands of new tokens are created daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.

### Meme Coins
Wong sees meme coins as a lasting phenomenon, not just a one-cycle trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. For a meme coin to succeed and last, he identifies key conditions:
1.  **Cult Leader:** A prominent figure driving the narrative (e.g., Ansem for WIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.
2.  **Good Meme:** The meme itself must be compelling and go viral (e.g., WIF's hat, which allows for "vampire attacking any meme" by adding the hat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.
3.  **Exchange Listing:** Ideally, getting listed on a major exchange like Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.

He no longer owns WIF because, from a risk-adjusted perspective, he doesn't believe it will outperform Solana, especially given the risk of meme coins going to zero in a downturn while Solana is "here to stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. He keeps Ethereum, despite its potential underperformance relative to Solana, due to an "emotional" attachment from being involved since its ICO in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>.

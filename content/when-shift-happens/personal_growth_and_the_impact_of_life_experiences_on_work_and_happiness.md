Jay, co-founder and CEO of Say Labs, shares his journey, highlighting how significant life events and personal challenges have profoundly shaped his approach to work, happiness, and [[personal growth and life frameworks | personal growth]]. His experiences, from early rejections to the loss of a parent, have influenced his entrepreneurial drive and his pursuit of fulfillment beyond traditional success metrics.

## An Early Life Crisis and the Search for Fulfillment

Jay experienced a significant turning point six years ago with the loss of his father, which he describes as an "early life crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This event forced him to deeply reflect on the concepts of fulfillment and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. He realized he had been taking his family and loved ones for granted, assuming they would "always be here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:50">[02:44:50]</a>. This experience compelled him to re-evaluate his life and prioritize personal relationships, ensuring he was comfortable with the time spent with family to avoid future regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Initially, he explored various hobbies like reading, poker, and chess in search of fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:02">[05:01:02]</a>. However, he eventually concluded that what truly brought him fulfillment was "building cool sh*t" and seeing it gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This realization stemmed from a lifelong inclination toward building things, influenced by growing up in the Bay Area and working as a software engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurial Spirit: A Chip on the Shoulder

Jay believes that people who achieve "exceptional things" often have "something that they want to prove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a> and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. This idea aligns with the concept of a "big chip on the shoulder" or "childhood trauma" driving intense work ethic, as noted by investor K. Wang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

Jay identifies with this drive, stemming from his own experiences of being "constantly rejected" while growing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.
His rejections included:
*   **Social Difficulties**: Moving to the U.S. at age four and struggling with English, making it hard to connect and make friends in elementary school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>.
*   **Academic Setbacks**: Viewing high school as a "failure" after being rejected from almost every college he applied to, including his expectation of Berkeley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. This instilled a desire to prove himself in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Relationships**: Facing rejection in romantic relationships and student organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

These experiences, though difficult, helped him develop "thicker skin" and made rejection "much less scary," which he sees as an advantage for a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. He reflects that early rejections can create a "hole in your heart" that motivates one to achieve more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. This "fire in your heart" is what keeps founders going beyond financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>.

## Mental Health and the Power of Self-Reflection

Jay recently started couples therapy, viewing it as a preventative measure for his relationship, similar to how he approaches physical health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. He highlights that therapy helps him dissect his feelings and understand the root causes of emotions and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. This process of going "a level deeper" is crucial for making progress in both personal and professional life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>.

He admits that as an "impatient founder," he previously had a bad habit of brushing aside small or medium problems in relationships, focusing only on large business issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. Therapy has taught him the importance of addressing issues early to prevent them from escalating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>. This self-awareness contributes to [[personal healing and selfawareness | personal healing and self-awareness]].

## Defining Happiness and Fulfillment

For Jay, happiness today comes from working on things that feel fulfilling and contribute to "something bigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>. Despite the daily "friction" and challenges (95 out of 100 things being undesirable), having a "North Star" keeps him motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>.

He cautions against relying on "short-term gratification" for long-term happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>. Instead, he advises exploring what truly "moves the needle" personally, whether it's work, relationships, family, or hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>.

## Lessons from Robinhood and the Pursuit of Impact

His experience at Robinhood, particularly during the "meme stock" chaos, significantly influenced his shift toward crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a>. The inability to justify Robinhood's decisions to his friends, despite not having full information himself, made him feel "powerless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>. This led him to become "much more bearish on like whenever there's like two dudes in the room that are like calling the shots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>. He became bullish on "trustless and verifiable" systems, which solidified his conviction in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:27:00">[36:27:00]</a>.

This experience, coupled with the realization that he derived the most fulfillment from building things that had an impact, propelled him to co-found Say Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Health Optimization as a Form of [[Personal Growth]]

Jay emphasizes optimizing three key areas for overall well-being: sleep, nutrition, and exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. He realized his past "extremely bad sleep habits" were detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a> and now aims for 7-8 hours of sleep for improved mood and mental functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

He also found profound [[personal growth through adversity | growth through adversity]] in running. Initially difficult due to his body type, the challenge made it enjoyable and satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. This consistent effort, especially after his father's passing, helped him regain a sense of control over his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Seeing incremental improvements in his running times became a source of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.

From overcoming childhood rejections to navigating personal loss and making significant career shifts, each event has contributed to his understanding of fulfillment and happiness.

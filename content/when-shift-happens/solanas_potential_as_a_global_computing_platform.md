Solana is envisioned as a "world computer" where anyone can build products, with their value ultimately judged by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This concept aims to overcome the inefficiencies and "walled gardens" prevalent in traditional internet and financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. For example, sending money internationally often involves inefficient hops between jurisdictions, a problem Solana is uniquely positioned to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## Mission: Accelerating World Computing

The current mission is to accelerate Solana into something the world has never seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This involves:
*   **Equal Opportunity:** Creating a merit-based system where anyone, regardless of background or location, has the same opportunity to build and create, with the market deciding the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Increased Efficiency:** Eliminating middlemen and reducing take rates, making capital movement easier and systems more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Unlocking Human Potential:** Allowing billions of people to realize their dormant potential, currently hindered by arbitrary "walled gardens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

> [!quote] The Ultimate Merit-Based System
> Having this kind of giant World computer where anyone regardless of what their name is or where they're from can just build products and be judged by the market is like the ultimate kind of Merit based system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

This grander mission aligns with a desire for human acceleration and discovering new "magic" by enabling better coordination, capital flow, and startup infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

## Helus's Role in Solana's Ecosystem

Helus, co-founded by Mert, is described as the "Home Depot for internet apps" or "a hammer and a nail on the internet," providing crucial infrastructure for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. The company was started to address the lack of applications in crypto by making it significantly easier for developers to bring their ideas to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

Initially, Helus considered being multi-chain, supporting both Ethereum and Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. However, the realization that building for everyone means building for nobody led to a focused decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. Solana was chosen because it already scaled and had solvable problems, unlike Ethereum which had many conditional scaling events that lowered the probability of building useful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.

> [!info] The Choice for Solana
> At the time, Ethereum wasn't scaling... if you keep multiplying all those events together in their conditional on each other the probability of building a useful application on Ethereum keeps getting lower and lower... versus on Solana it already works it already scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.

Helus builds APIs and tools that allow product teams, like those at Coinbase, to rapidly bootstrap and build on Solana, filling a critical gap where such resources were previously nonexistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. Helus has become the number one validator on Solana, demonstrating strong execution capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>.

## Resilience and Advocacy

Solana faced a "disastrous end of 2022" with the collapse of FTX, leading many to believe the chain was dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>. However, Mert viewed FTX's demise as an "awesome" development, believing the ecosystem could be "way better" without the "predatory person" and their "horrible tokenomics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. Despite previous outages, he trusted Solana's proposed technical solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.

During this period, Mert became a prominent advocate for Solana, countering widespread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) with facts and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. This role, often referred to as a "reply guy," is crucial for progress and knowledge creation in crypto, where short-term incentives and social aspects can lead to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. By publicly correcting falsehoods, even if they don't change an individual's mind, they inform a broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

## Investment and Future Outlook

Investment from firms like Founders Fund indicates a long-term belief in Solana's potential for asymmetric growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. This reflects confidence that if Solana grows, companies like Helus will capture a significant portion of that upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>.

Despite recent successes, a sense of "paranoia" and a "job not finished" mentality persists, emphasizing the need for continuous acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. Solana, as an L1 blockchain with thousands of nodes, faces structural disadvantages compared to centralized L2s that can ship updates much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. The competition is not just other RPC providers, but anyone not building on Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:27">[01:20:27]</a>.

> [!warning] The Need for Acceleration
> Acceleration is not about going fast and then staying at that pace. Acceleration is the rate of change in velocity, meaning you need to keep being faster and faster and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.

While challenges remain, including potential future outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>, the focus remains on building, iterating, improving systems, debating ideas, telling the vision, and recruiting the best talent to ensure Solana's continued progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. The core belief is that one must both think and do, and actively sell the vision, to realize this potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:55">[01:24:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

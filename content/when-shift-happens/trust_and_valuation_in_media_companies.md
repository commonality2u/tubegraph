Media, particularly in the crypto space, operates fundamentally as a "trust game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">00:52:26</a>. Unlike software businesses, where more capital can lead to faster growth, trust cannot be bought with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">00:46:30</a>. Companies that attempted to gain market share by simply buying page views, clicks, or subscribers failed because they neglected to build genuine trust and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">00:46:34</a>.

## Building a Media Business

Historically, most media businesses begin by creating a content distribution channel, such as a podcast or newsletter, to build an audience. Only later do they introduce advertisements, hire staff, and potentially expand into events or subscription products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">00:24:01</a>. Blockworks, a crypto media empire valued at $135 million, initially operated "ass backwards" by starting with events to generate immediate cash flow before focusing on in-house content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">00:24:38</a>. This early focus on cash flow rather than owning intellectual property (IP) meant that while they made money, they weren't [[building_a_brand_and_media_business | building a scalable business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">00:04:02</a>.

### The Significance of Intellectual Property (IP)
Early in its development, Blockworks built shows and events for other prominent figures in the crypto space, generating revenue but failing to create their own IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">00:04:04</a>. This approach generated cash flow, but it wasn't scalable or building a sustainable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">00:04:27</a>. A major pivot during the COVID-19 pandemic forced Blockworks to shift its strategy, cutting outsourced podcasts and focusing on developing in-house shows like "Empire" and "On The Margin" to own their content and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">00:34:26</a>.

## Valuation of Revenue Streams
Not all revenue is valued equally by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">00:27:33</a>. When Blockworks raised $12 million at a $135 million post-money valuation, their revenue was segmented into:
*   **Conference Revenue**: Valued at a certain multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">00:30:11</a>.
*   **Digital Revenue (Podcasts and Newsletters)**: Valued at a higher multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">00:30:12</a>.
*   **Subscription/Analytics Revenue**: Valued at the highest multiple, often 15 times more than conference revenue in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">00:27:54</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">00:30:15</a>.

This implies that while $20 million in conference revenue might be identical in raw numbers to $2 million in subscription revenue, their market valuation can be vastly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">00:30:21</a>.

## Components of a Media Business

### Podcasts
Podcasts are considered the most intimate form of advertising and content consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">00:36:40</a>. A host speaking directly into a listener's ear for an hour fosters a sense of friendship and trust, making it a powerful form of brand awareness, akin to influencer marketing in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">00:37:37</a>. This intimate connection leads to higher value for advertisers compared to newsletter or display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">00:36:53</a>.

### Conferences
Conferences involve substantial upfront costs, making them the riskiest part of a media business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">00:41:01</a>. The work required for a medium-sized conference is similar to that of a large one, pushing organizers towards larger events for better economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">00:40:19</a>. Planning needs to occur years in advance, requiring predictions about market cycles (bull vs. bear) to determine size and timing, adding significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">00:42:02</a>. A missed conference can jeopardize the entire business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">00:32:07</a>.

### Data and Analytics
A key component of a successful B2B media model is a product, such as data and analytics, sitting at the bottom of the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">00:44:27</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">00:48:03</a>. This subscription-based service benefits from a "negative customer acquisition cost model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">00:48:47</a>. The audience built through news, podcasts, and conferences funnels directly into the research platform, reducing the need for expensive sales and marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">00:49:03</a>. This combination of news (builds trust), podcasts/newsletters (builds distribution), conferences (generates cash flow), and research/data (increases enterprise valuation) creates an "unfair advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">00:49:50</a>.

## Impact of Raising Capital
Raising capital, such as Blockworks' $12 million round, significantly increases the stakes for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">00:51:27</a>. It creates a promise to investors for a substantial return on their capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">00:50:57</a>. This shift can reorient focus towards aspects that maximize enterprise valuation, like the analytics and research side of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">00:51:37</a>.

However, maintaining the integrity of the brand and the trust built with the audience is paramount. For example, refusing to accept payment for podcast guest appearances, even if it could generate short-term cash, is crucial to preserve trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">00:52:48</a>. This demonstrates the [[importance_of_integrity_and_contrarian_thinking_for_founders_and_investors | importance of integrity]] in long-term company building.

## Market Cycles and Strategic Decisions
The cyclical nature of the crypto market heavily influences business operations. In a bear market, companies like Blockworks will strategically increase hiring and marketing efforts when costs are lower, despite appearing "lunatic" to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">01:30:52</a>. Conversely, in a bull market, they plan to slow down hiring and marketing to avoid inflated costs and prevent overextension, demonstrating an understanding of how to [[managing_risk_and_making_informed_investment_decisions | manage risk]] within market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">01:31:33</a>. This strategic timing is akin to investing: buying when others are fearful and selling when they are greedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:56">01:33:56</a>.

## The Role of Design
For a small company, world-class design is crucial to appearing larger and more legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">01:47:05</a>. A beautiful front end and website create a strong first impression, signaling legitimacy and professionalism before any content is even consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:39">01:47:39</a>. This is an often-underrated aspect, especially in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">01:47:48</a>.

The future of media, particularly in crypto, emphasizes [[the_future_of_investing_and_social_capital | building a brand based on trust]] and an owned audience, rather than relying on rented platforms or short-term revenue gains. The combination of diverse revenue streams, strategic market timing, and a relentless focus on trust and quality underpins a sustainable and valuable media enterprise.

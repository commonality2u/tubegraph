Ryan Kim, co-founder and partner at Hash, a global early-stage venture fund, shares insights into navigating the demanding world of crypto entrepreneurship while maintaining a balanced personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. His journey highlights the evolution from a passionate hobby to a structured investment firm, alongside a deep personal transformation that emphasizes [[balancing_personal_and_professional_life_as_a_founder | sustainability]] and [[balancing_professional_success_with_personal_life | well-being]].

## The Genesis of a Venture: From Hobby to Fund

Hash began in 2016 as a collective of individual investors, including Ryan and his co-founders, who met weekly to study Ethereum and Bitcoin over coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This informal gathering evolved into the initiation of the Korean crypto community by 2017, evangelizing blockchain's future to developers, founders, conglomerates, and venture capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Many founders were introduced to their network, leading to unexpected opportunities for private sale investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

At this time, the venture was largely a side hobby for Ryan, who was working full-time as a data scientist, developing personalization algorithms for e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. He realized blockchain offered a "heaven" for data scientists, as all data is open, allowing them to utilize it for business opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. This conviction led him to jump into the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

## Navigating Compensation in the Crypto Landscape

A unique challenge in the crypto industry is the compensation model, where individuals often receive allocations rather than salaries, requiring them to work and invest simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. Ryan managed this by maximizing his network to connect founders with the right partnerships, a valuable service that required less direct time commitment compared to content writing or marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. He continued his data science job during the day and transitioned into an investor after 6 p.m. until November 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

## The Pursuit of [[worklife_balance_and_risktaking_in_entrepreneurship | Sustainability]]

For Ryan, the concept of [[balancing_personal_and_professional_life_as_a_founder | sustainability]] has become a central mentor in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This philosophy extends beyond the business ecosystem to his personal and family life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

### Personal Transformation Through Fatherhood

Having children profoundly impacted Ryan's perspective, making him feel as though his life extended by 30 to 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. This shift stemmed from a newfound responsibility to care for the world and ecosystem for his children's future, rather than solely focusing on his own prosperity or success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. He began to feel less self-centered, embracing the spiritual aspect of thinking about others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

This change also made him more conservative in personal life, though still a risk-taker in investment, and more attentive to his physical and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. He now seeks a more peaceful real life while maintaining a dynamic life "on-chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>.

### The "Portfolio of Happiness"

To maintain [[balancing_professional_success_with_personal_life | balance]] and perspective, Ryan practices what he calls a "portfolio of happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. This involves making a balance between three key components of his life:
1.  **Himself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>
2.  **His family** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>
3.  **His business/company** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>

He regularly checks in on these three areas, noting that if his personal life and family are stable and happy, he can navigate business challenges more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. This approach prevents his entire happiness from being tied to a single "bucket" like business or market performance, which can lead to instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>.

He also uses meditation as a tool to remain objective, learning from every event, even challenging ones like the Terra collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This objective stance helps him grow from negative experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.

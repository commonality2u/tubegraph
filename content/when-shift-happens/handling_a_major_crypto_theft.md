The co-founder and CEO of Bybit, Ben Zhou, detailed the events and response to a $1.5 billion Ethereum theft that occurred on a Friday night at 10 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

## The Incident
Ben Zhou received a call from his CFO, indicating bad news, which he immediately suspected was a hacking incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Initially, Zhou thought the loss was 30,000 Ethereum (ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. His CFO's voice began to shake as he corrected him, stating the entire wallet was gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The total amount in the wallet was approximately 400,000 to 410,000 ETH, equivalent to $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This immediately caused Zhou to feel shaky and sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Immediate Response and Crisis Management
Zhou's immediate reaction was to snap out of panic within 10 seconds, focusing on solutions rather than the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. His first priority was to confirm if other wallets were secure to understand if the problem was contained, as this dictated the next course of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The security team confirmed only the specific cold wallet, which used Genesis Safe, was hacked, while Bybit's other wallets, including a $3 billion stablecoin wallet, remained secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

The crucial next step was to determine if Bybit could cover the loss with its own funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Upon his CFO's confirmation that they could, Zhou felt immense relief, knowing clients were safe and there would be no legal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

### Internal Procedures
Bybit has a P-1 (very critical) incident procedure for events impacting over 10,000 clients or causing more than $1 million in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This system automatically alerts all management and initiates a coordinated response, including a dedicated meeting room and assigned roles for note-taking, commanding, and instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. They conduct monthly drills for these P-1 incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. While procedures are in place, a significant amount of judgment is required, especially in an unprecedented situation like a hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Public Relations and Communication
Unlike typical incidents where the CEO's role is internal, Zhou understood that a hack of this magnitude required his direct, transparent communication to the public to prevent a bank run and combat speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. He drafted the first tweet himself and opted for a live stream where he appeared on camera, rather than just a Twitter Space, to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

> "No let them see my face let them say B our liquidity back to 100 now all the institutions are back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>

## Addressing the Bank Run and Liquidity
Despite being transparently 1:1 backed with client assets, Bybit was short on Ethereum immediately after the hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Zhou wanted clients to withdraw to prove Bybit's solvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. To quickly acquire ETH without manipulating the market, Bybit sought bridge loans from partners, collateralizing them with Bitcoin and USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

A significant challenge arose when Genesis Safe, the third-party service used for the hacked wallet, shut down its service, preventing withdrawals from any wallet using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. This also affected potential bridge loan providers whose funds were stuck in Genesis Safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. Bybit also had $3 billion in USDT stuck in Genesis Safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. With a projected six-hour limit until their existing stablecoin wallet ran out due to withdrawal requests, Bybit's team rapidly developed and tested a new software solution to safely transfer the $3 billion out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. Bybit covered the full ETH amount within three days through a combination of loans, whale deposits, and OTC purchases of close to 300,000 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. As of the time of the podcast, the liquidity gap was fully closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

## Leadership and Team Resilience
Zhou's personal history, living alone since age 12, instilled in him a proactive problem-solving mindset, which he believes prevented him from experiencing the initial phases of anger and depression typically associated with such events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. He claims not to feel stress when there are clear actions to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. His main fear is not pushing his limits and disappointing those who trust him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

The success of the response relied heavily on the Bybit team's cohesion and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. They processed approximately 350,000 withdrawal requests within 12 hours without stopping any withdrawals, a rare feat for a hacked exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. This was possible due to Bybit's significant investment in:
*   **Real-time Business Intelligence Systems**: Providing immediate data on margin calculations, wallet levels, and withdrawal predictions, enabling data-driven decisions during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. This contrasts with other companies that often lack understanding of their own data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.
*   **Talent and Team Development**: Investing in a highly precise and efficient team through rigorous hiring and probation processes, ensuring everyone knows their role during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.

## [[Lessons learned from major crypto market events]] and Future Improvements
The incident provided several key [[lessons_learned_from_major_crypto_market_events | lessons learned from major crypto market events]]:
*   **In-House Solutions**: Bybit learned that as a large target, it should develop its own wallet security solutions rather than relying solely on third-party providers, especially for critical assets like Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. The regret is not having built this in-house ETH wallet infrastructure earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>.
*   **Wallet Splitting**: Implementing strategies to split wallets so that a breach of one does not severely impact the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
*   **Offline Signing**: Prioritizing solutions that involve completely offline signing processes to prevent penetration through online vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.
*   **Strategic Role Assignment**: A regret was placing key personnel like the Head of Finance in critical signer roles, exposing them to immense personal pressure during a hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.
*   **Optimized Withdrawal Systems**: Further improving withdrawal systems to eliminate queues during crises, ensuring clients can access their funds immediately and effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.

## Impact on the Crypto Industry
Despite the setback, Bybit's handling of the crisis has positively impacted its reputation, garnering trust from clients and regulators, and potentially serving as a model for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. It showcased that the industry has evolved since previous major collapses like FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

The incident highlights ongoing [[challenges_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges in the crypto industry]], particularly concerning security and self-custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. While the "not your keys, not your coin" adage applies to individuals, major exchanges are also targets, emphasizing the need for advanced internal security measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

### Hack Bounty Initiative
To combat the broader problem of crypto theft and help other victims, Bybit is launching `hackbounty.com` (or `hackbounty.crypto`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:08">[01:22:08]</a>. This platform aims to:
*   Aggregate information on stolen funds and their endpoints (mixers, bridges, exchanges) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.
*   Allow "bounty hunters" to trace and submit information on money movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>.
*   Rank exchanges and services based on their responsiveness in freezing funds or providing tracking information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>. This will incentivize faster responses and expose non-cooperative entities, potentially violating sanction laws if they handle illicit funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.

This initiative is a step towards using blockchain's transparency to solve its own problems, helping to [[challenges_and_solutions_in_crypto_security | improve crypto security]] and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.

## Other Aspects
*   **No Native Token**: Bybit has chosen not to launch a native token, as they believe it can create conflicts of interest and add another layer of complexity during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>.
*   **On-Chain Future**: Ben Zhou still believes the future is on-chain, but centralized exchanges remain crucial for the broader adoption and navigation of the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. He doesn't see centralized exchanges as dying but rather evolving alongside on-chain infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>.

[[introduction_to_prism_finance_and_its_impact_on_the_ecosystem | Prism Finance]] introduces a novel concept to the DeFi space known as "refracting digital assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This protocol aims to revolutionize how users interact with and manage their digital assets within the ecosystem by allowing them to separate the principal value of an asset from its future yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## The Problem Prism Solves
Traditionally, when users stake assets like Luna into validators to receive airdrops or staking rewards, their assets become illiquid for a specific period, often 21 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This means the staked Luna cannot be used simultaneously for other purposes such as generating bLuna for collateral, providing liquidity, or trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. [[understanding_refracting_digital_assets_in_prism_protocol | Prism Protocol]] addresses this by allowing users to achieve both liquidity and yield generation simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Refracting Digital Assets
[[understanding_refracting_digital_assets_in_prism_protocol | Prism Protocol]] functions similarly to a glass prism, splitting a single asset into multiple components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. When a yield-generating asset, such as Luna, is deposited into the Prism vault, it issues a "collateral token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This collateral token can then be split into two fundamental underlying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>:

*   **Principal Token (PT)**: This token represents the underlying asset's principal value and maintains its liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. It allows users to borrow against it, trade it, or use it to provide liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For Luna, this is called P-Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Yield Token (YT)**: This token represents the future yield generated by the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It is responsible for earning airdrops, staking rewards, and other forms of yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. For Luna, this is called Y-Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## The Prism Mechanism
The process of splitting assets works as follows:
1.  **Deposit**: A user deposits a yield-bearing asset into the Prism vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
2.  **Term Selection**: The user selects a commitment term for their assets (e.g., one, three, six, nine, twelve months, or perpetually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  **Minting**: The smart contract then mints a Principal Token (PT) and a Yield Token (YT) with a matching maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Prism V1.0 will initially enable perpetual yield tokens and perpetual principal tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
4.  **Options**: Once minted, holders of PT and YT have several options:
    *   Stake the Yield Token (YT) in Prism to be eligible for staking rewards and airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   Trade the Principal Token (PT) and Yield Token (YT) separately on Prism's Automated Market Maker (AMM) Decentralized Exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   Combine PT and YT in equal amounts and burn them to redeem the original collateral token at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This collateral token can then be burned to redeem the original asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Benefits of Splitting Assets
This innovative approach offers several advantages:
*   **Risk Management**: Users can manage risks associated with volatile prices and unstable yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Instant Liquidity**: Users can raise liquidity instantly by selling their future yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Borrowing without Liquidation Risk**: Borrowing can occur with no liquidation risk or daily funding costs by monetizing an asset's future yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Yield Conversion**: Variable rate yields can be swapped into fixed rate yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Leveraged Exposure**: Users can gain leveraged exposure to an asset's price or yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Currency Risk Management**: Exposure to currency risks can be managed by converting future yields into a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Capital Efficient Staking**: Participation in capital-efficient liquid staking allows users to receive all staking rewards (including airdrops) while being able to trade or deploy their assets elsewhere in DeFi instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Automatic Airdrop Claiming**: [[understanding_refracting_digital_assets_in_prism_protocol | Prism Protocol]] automatically claims all airdrops through its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Reduced Administrative Burden**: The platform ultimately reduces the administrative burden on a user's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Example User Interaction with Luna
A user could interact with [[understanding_refracting_digital_assets_in_prism_protocol | Prism Protocol]] using Luna in the following way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>:
1.  **Deposit and Mint**: The user deposits Luna into Prism and mints P-Luna (principal token) and Y-Luna (yield token) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
2.  **Stake Y-Luna**: The user stakes the Y-Luna within Prism to begin receiving staking rewards, including airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
3.  **Provide Liquidity with P-Luna**: Simultaneously, the user utilizes the P-Luna as a liquidity provider in the P-Luna Prism AMM liquidity pool, earning liquidity incentives and AMM fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
4.  **Rebalancing Exposure**: After some time, the user decides to sell their Y-Luna and buy more P-Luna. They unstake the Y-Luna from Prism and immediately sell it on the AMM without any unstaking period, due to the deep liquid markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The proceeds are then used to buy additional P-Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
5.  **Leveraged Exposure**: This action weights the user's portfolio towards principal tokens, providing leveraged exposure to Luna's price performance without liquidation risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Future Expansion
The ultimate goal for [[prism_protocol_future_roadmap_and_expansion_plans | Prism Protocol]] is to enable users to refract "every yield bearing asset" that they can obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This includes adding more Proof-of-Stake assets like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cosmos, as well as assets native to the [[functionalities_and_benefits_of_the_prism_protocol_with_terra_ecosystem | Terra ecosystem]] such as UST, Mirror assets, Anchor Protocol's MIN, and their respective LP tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This vision extends to yield farms, LP tokens, and assets created by new protocols at launch, including money market protocols, DEXes, and protocol bridging for stablecoins like USDC, DAI, and Tether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

James B, founder of the $1.5 billion digital finance group Jsquare, is known as an early investor in various companies and projects including Circle, Ledger, Pudgy Penguins, and Polkadot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. He proudly owns more than 1% of Polkadot's total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Background and Early Influences
James B's interest in investment began at a young age, influenced by his parents who operated various businesses in the financial sector in China, primarily in private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. His father, at one point, asked him to estimate the value of a building, which was his first lesson in asset valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. He started investing in stocks and gold in high school, with his parents lending him money and allowing him to keep the profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. While half of his early success he attributes to luck, the other half he credits to skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

He studied mathematics in college, believing it would be relevant to the financial industry and quantitative trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. During his undergraduate degree in China, around 2013, he discovered Bitcoin from a schoolmate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. After months of reading the white paper and books, he realized Bitcoin was a significant innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

## Discovering Bitcoin and Initial Investment
At 21, James B identified Bitcoin as a potential solution to China's high inflation and money printing, where the M2 money supply was growing at 14-15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. He saw it as a "perfect solution" with a fully decentralized system, reasonable inflation, and immutable rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. He initially bought Bitcoin with his own money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

After graduating in 2015, his family supported his idea to start a small [[Investment Opportunities in Crypto|investment firm]] focused on Bitcoin and related businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. They provided $20 million, which he primarily used to buy Bitcoin in the 2015 bear market when prices ranged from $150 to $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. He maintained conviction despite sideways or downward price movements, not needing short-term profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. By the 2017 peak, the initial $20 million investment was worth over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Strategies

### Early Mistakes and Lessons Learned
One of James B's early mistakes was the desire for "more Bitcoin" beyond just holding it, leading him to explore primary market investments (equity deals in crypto businesses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. These investments, while educational, ultimately underperformed compared to simply holding Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

A "very big mistake" in 2017 was not investing in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), as he didn't understand their model or value at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. He invested in traditional equity deals like exchanges and infrastructure instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

### Risk Management and Market Cycles
Recognizing the cyclical nature of crypto, James B de-risked his positions at the peak of the 2017 bull market by holding a significant amount of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>. This strategic move proved crucial during the 2018-2019 bear market, preventing him from needing to borrow more funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

### Shift to Layer 1 Protocols and Token Investments
Learning from his 2017 ICO mistake, James B shifted focus to investing in tokens, particularly Layer 1 protocols, during the subsequent bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. He acquired tokens like Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL), and Near Protocol (NEAR) in the OTC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. His strategy was to own a "certain percentage of the network," aiming for 1-3% of the total supply, successfully achieving over 1% of Polkadot and almost 1% of Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

While these Layer 1 investments proved highly profitable, he admits a "crazy bad decision" to sell Solana at less than $3 when it later yielded almost 100x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>. He held Polkadot until its peak in 2020-2021, which was the main source of profit for his firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

### Diversification and Niche Opportunities
Beyond Layer 1s, he continued to invest in the Polkadot ecosystem and infrastructure projects like CoinList, Republic, and ChainSafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

He also ventured into NFTs, specifically investing in Pudgy Penguins during the bear market, seeing it as a "good opportunity for the investor to actually buy NFT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. He views NFTs as a crucial tool for "massive adoption" by making crypto more relatable to the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. His belief in Pudgy Penguins stemmed from its top 10 ranking, significant traffic and followers, and the team's ability to build community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

### Portfolio Management and Focus
A key learning from the last bull market was the mistake of investing in "too many early-stage projects," making it "super hard to manage more than 100 portfolios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. His current optimal portfolio size is between 50 and 80 projects, with a focus on "middle to late-stage deals" with ticket sizes typically ranging from $1 million to $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.

### Lessons from the 2022 Crypto Winter
The 2022 crypto winter, marked by collapses like Luna, FTX, and Genesis, was a "tough year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. Despite de-risking in 2021 by holding cash, James B made the mistake of lending stablecoins to platforms like Genesis and BlockFi for small returns, resulting in significant losses (nine figures at Genesis, eight figures at BlockFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>. The "key learning" from this was:
> "Since I already in an industry which have super high risks, right? You're asking, you're asking for certain return but super high risk. Why are you trying to do something for small returns by super high risk? It doesn't make any sense." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>

He concludes that in crypto, one should either aim for "big return, take high risk" or "never do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

## Future Investment Thesis
James B believes two areas are currently "deeply undervalued":
1.  **Other Layer 1 Protocols:** Beyond Ethereum and its Layer 2s, he sees value in Layer 1s that can achieve "localized adoption" in specific markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>. He cites examples like Shard in India and Astar in Japan, which, despite not having superior technology, "moving quicker in this jurisdictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.
2.  **Applications for Mainstream Adoption:** With existing infrastructure, the focus should shift to applications that drive "more usage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. He highlights DeFi and NFTs (like Pudgy Penguins) as examples that can bring millions of users into crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.

## Independent Thinking and Conviction
A core principle for success, particularly in the [[insights_on_crypto_trading_and_market_strategies|crypto investment strategies]] space, is to "think independently" and "have your own thesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. He notes that 90% of VCs in the market lack their own investment thesis and simply follow major firms like a16z or Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. This independent thinking, coupled with bravery, is what he is most proud of in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.

> "If you have your own thesis, you are actually much more likely to do well because you have your own thesis, your own conviction and obviously be open that things could take the wrong turn or change but be independent in your thinking." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>

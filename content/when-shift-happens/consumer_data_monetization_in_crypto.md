Seb, co-founder and CEO of Sofon, a consumer crypto platform, aims to onboard the next generation of crypto users by rewarding them for the data they generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. His company, Sofon, successfully raised $60 million in the largest blockchain node sale to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Problem with Crypto Adoption
Seb identifies that the crypto industry has largely built products for "crypto-native" users, leading to a stagnation in user growth despite innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. He argues that the problem lies in *how* crypto is presented, not in people's willingness to accept technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Most people (ages 12-50) extensively use technology in their daily lives but are not using crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Current crypto usage often revolves around payments and speculation, with many "PVP (Player vs. Player) ecosystems" where one must lose for another to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This speculative, zero-sum environment hinders mass adoption because users, upon losing, are unlikely to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Seb believes the industry needs to redefine "using crypto" and move towards "PVE (Player vs. Environment) ecosystems" where everyone can win based on their contributions, merit, or data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Sofon: A Solution for Data Monetization
Sofon aims to bridge the gap between everyday technology users and crypto by enabling them to monetize the data they already generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. The core idea is to allow people to continue their existing habits while reaping rewards from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

> [!quote] Seb on Sofon's mission
> "My dream is really to start merging crypto with everyday consumer's lives... to monetize their data. Earn rewards, earn loyalty, social verification, social validation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:6:58">[00:46:58]</a>

Sofon acts as a "marketplace for data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. When users interact with platforms like Whoop, Spotify, Ticketmaster, Lululemon, or Chess.com, they generate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Currently, companies profit from this aggregated data for marketing, but the individual user does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. Sofon provides a "unique, one-stop shop profile" (Sofon data hub) for all of a user's data habits, allowing them to share this data and receive rewards directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.

Instead of companies paying influencers or Meta for reach, a portion of marketing budgets can be driven straight to the consumer who generates the data, making the brand relationship stickier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. This approach rewires how advertising spend works, shifting power and value to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.

## The Role of ZKTLS
A critical component of this model is ZKTLS (Zero-Knowledge TLS) technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.
> [!info] What is ZKTLS?
> ZKTLS is an invisible technology that verifiably proves the data you generate on a blockchain, anonymously and while conserving privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. It's a "web proof" that allows users to prove different forms of data on-chain, for example, an Uber trip, without divulging personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.

ZKTLS is a "massive Trojan horse" for crypto because it allows users to monetize their attention and habits without having to learn complex crypto concepts like MetaMask or seed phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This frictionless onboarding is key to attracting the next wave of users beyond early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

## Real-World Applications
Sofon is focused on creating new paradigms and making crypto part of people's everyday lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

*   **Ticketing and Fandom:** Sofon recently acquired a ticketing company to address issues like ticket scalping and bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. By verifying a user's fandom (e.g., through Spotify listening history for a Taylor Swift fan), tickets can be distributed fairly, rewarding true loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. This leverages emotional attachment to build a more rewarding system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>.
*   **Gaming:** Sofon is integrating crypto into traditional mobile games, moving beyond speculative "play-to-earn" models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. For example, a new version of "Trial Extreme" will integrate crypto in the backend for payments, loyalty, and in-game advertising, appealing to its millions of existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. This aligns with the broader [[Impact of crypto gaming on adoption and economy | impact of crypto gaming on adoption]].
*   **Monetizing Attention:** The overarching goal is for users to monetize their attention and the valuable data they generate, which has historically been exploited by Web2 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. This fosters a shift towards a more equitable [[Human Values and Consumerism in the Crypto World | consumerism]] model in the digital realm.

## Product-Led Approach
Sofon operates as a product-led company, meaning the product team drives development, with engineering serving its vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>. This focus ensures the user experience is intuitive and familiar to non-crypto users, resembling existing tech habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. Seb emphasizes that their approach is about [[Redefining Crypto for Wider Adoption | redefining crypto for wider adoption]] by focusing on the consumer's experience rather than just technical innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

Projects like Jupiter and Hyperliquid are cited as successful examples of building for a known user base (traders/speculators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. Sofon, however, tackles the harder challenge of building for users who don't yet know they need crypto, creating a new "green field" in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>. This ties into [[Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto | broader challenges and opportunities in crypto]].

## Success and Vision
Seb measures Sofon's success by achieving product-market fit and catalyzing a change in how consumers interact with crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. The goal is for people to look back and recognize Sofon's role in making crypto more accessible and exciting for the mainstream, much like the NFT boom brought crypto closest to the consumer previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>. This vision is supported by [[Digital marketing strategies in the era of social media and crypto | innovative digital marketing strategies]] and a clear focus on the end-user.

Pendle Finance is a decentralized project pioneering yield tokenization on Ethereum, enabling users to trade yield and earn fixed yield on their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Its core function involves tokenizing a yield-bearing asset (like Lido's stETH) into two distinct tokens: a Principal Token (PT) and a Yield Token (YT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.

## Pendle V1: Early Challenges and Learnings
Launched in June 2021, Pendle V1 faced significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Key issues included:
*   **High Transaction Costs**: An end-to-end transaction could cost a user around $1,000 in gas fees due to the assumption that "everything should be onchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
*   **Suboptimal UI/UX**: The user interface and experience were described as "terrible" and "extremely difficult" to use, often copying elements from other established protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound without sufficient data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
*   **Market Environment**: V1 launched during a bull market where users prioritized floating rates (20-30% APY) over fixed rates, making it hard for Pendle's fixed yield offering to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. Competitors like [[Highyield stablecoin interest | Anchor Protocol]] offered a fixed 20% APY, which was highly appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

## Pendle V2: Iteration and Strategic Growth
Pendle V2, launched in December 2022, represented a significant shift in strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, focusing on:
*   **Iterative Product Development**: Recognizing that the initial product wouldn't be the final state, the team committed to continuous improvement based on user interactions and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.
*   **Business Development (BD) and Growth**: A major investment in BD and growth efforts differentiated V2 from V1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Educational Materials**: To address the steep learning curve of the V1 product, V2 heavily invested in creating educational materials to simplify understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution Outlets**: Emphasizing distribution, the team focused on getting people to talk about Pendle and ensuring their product reached the right target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This aligns with the Silicon Valley saying that "first-time founders focus on the product, second-time founders focus on distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Growth Strategy and Narratives
Pendle's growth after V2 was significantly driven by strategic positioning within major crypto narratives and strong partnerships:
*   **Leveraging Attention**: The team realized that while fundamental utility gives a protocol a non-zero value, the actual premium is attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. A key early boost came from Alex Vovik's public purchase of Pendle tokens, giving the community confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Identifying Liquidity Flows**: Pendle adopted a strategy similar to macro traders like Stan Druckenmiller, identifying where "big money movements" were occurring across trends and inserting themselves to help users capitalize on those opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens)**: In early 2023, Pendle identified LSTs (like Lido, Rocket Pool) as a dominant trend, as DeFi users sought to [[Yield in crypto vs capital gains | generate yield]] from their ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Pendle partnered with Rocket Pool, Balancer, and Aura to collectively market a new product line, leveraging their larger size to gain visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>.
*   **Arbitrum and Re-staking**: Subsequently, Pendle capitalized on Arbitrum and, more recently, the re-staking narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.
*   **Points System as a Catalyst**: The "points" system, popularized by EigenLayer, became a major catalyst for Pendle's product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>. Pendle had prior experience with similar systems (e.g., Swell's "pearls") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>. Pendle assigned all earned points from underlying protocols to the Yield Token (YT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. They also negotiated multipliers for these points, allowing users depositing through Pendle to earn 3x points compared to direct deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. This incentivized liquidity to flow into Pendle's pools, making the Principal Token (PT) more attractive due to higher fixed APYs (40-60% on ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>. Pendle positions itself as a neutral platform, helping protocols go to market and bootstrap initial traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

### Understanding Pendle's Yield Tokenization
Pendle tokenizes yield-bearing assets into two separate tokens:
*   **Principal Token (PT)**: Represents the underlying asset's principal value at maturity. PT generally offers a fixed interest rate (fixed APY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>. It does not earn yield itself but is structured like a zero-coupon bond, allowing users to buy it at a discount and redeem it one-to-one with the underlying asset at maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:08:03]</a>.
*   **Yield Token (YT)**: Represents the future yield of the underlying asset, including points from protocols like EigenLayer and LRTs (e.g., Ether.fi, Renzo, Kelp) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Users bullish on a protocol's performance or token airdrop potential will buy YT for its points exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:49]</a>.
*   **Relationship**: One PT + One YT always equals the value of the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>. Their prices are inversely related: if YT demand increases, its price rises, causing PT's price to decrease (increasing its discount to the underlying) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.

## Impressive Growth Metrics
Pendle has experienced explosive growth:
*   **TVL (Total Value Locked)**: Grew from $5 million at the start of 2023 to around $250 million by year-end, and subsequently to nearly $7 billion in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. This growth was largely due to re-staking protocols like Ether.fi, Renzo, Kelp, and Ethena, and Zircuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>. At one point, Pendle surpassed Compound and other respected protocols in TVL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.
*   **FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation)**: Increased from $10 million to approximately $1.5-$1.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>.
*   **User Count & Trading Volume**: User count and daily trading volume have grown significantly, from roughly one transaction every two days to thousands daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. Daily trading volume averages $100-$200 million, largely due to the YT (Yield Token) intervention allowing users to express bullish views on points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.

## Future Potential
Pendle sees significant market potential in:
*   **Re-staking Ecosystem**: The re-staking narrative is considered "very sound" as it allows users to [[Yield optimization in crypto space | generate more yield]] from the same assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. With Lido alone holding $35 billion in TVL, Pendle believes much of this could be channeled into re-staking protocols like Karak and Symbiotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>, projecting tens of billions of dollars in market potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin Ecosystem**: Pendle is exploring the [[Bitcoin yield earning strategies | Bitcoin ecosystem]] to help users make their dormant Bitcoin more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. This market is also projected to hold tens of billions of dollars in value, even if Pendle captures just 1% of Bitcoin's trillion-dollar market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

## Key Realizations and Lessons Learned
The founder's journey highlights several important lessons:
*   **Persistence**: Don't give up too early on a big idea, as it can take years (like Pendle's 2-3 years to achieve product-market fit or Uniswap and Aave's journey from 2017 to 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Token Price as Marketing**: The price of a token is an ultimate marketing tool; a strong price indicates success and attracts attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Focus on Distribution**: Building the best product isn't enough; distribution and gaining attention are crucial for success in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Mindset and Self-Belief**: Entrepreneurship requires immense grit, strong self-belief, the ability to convey a mission to others, and resilience in the face of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. The analogy of "anyone can cook" from Ratatouille suggests that talent can come from anywhere, reinforcing the idea that one doesn't need to come from a specific background (like Silicon Valley) to start something big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Surrounding Yourself with Mentors**: Being around accomplished individuals (like CZ, Arthur Hayes, Joe Lubin) is incredibly inspiring and builds confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **Disciplined Investing**: Learning from past mistakes (e.g., losing money on ICOs or altcoins) leads to the conclusion that most people are better off sticking to "blue chips" like Bitcoin and Ethereum and avoiding complex, risky strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. It takes discipline to resist the temptation of "shitcoins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.
*   **Community as a Product**: As seen with Monet, building a strong community from day one, even before a product is fully launched, is critical for attracting liquidity and subsequent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.

## Favorite Teams and Collaborations
The founder holds high regard for several teams in the crypto space:
*   **Ethena**: Praised for their superb execution and clear game plan in increasing stablecoin adoption by partnering with upcoming projects to accept USDe as collateral for points campaigns (e.g., Symbiotic, Karak, Zircuit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.
*   **Monet**: Impressed by their ability to build a strong community even before product launch, embracing memes and prioritizing community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   **Ether.fi**: Considered an "execution beast" for their product churn, community management, and clear, direct communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:39">[01:41:39]</a>.

The founder believes the next 12 months will be game-changing for Pendle, with new product developments enabling use cases not currently possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>.

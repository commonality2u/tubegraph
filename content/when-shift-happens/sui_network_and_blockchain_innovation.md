Adony Aboten, Co-founder and CPO at Mist Labs, discusses the company's vision for a more decentralized internet, the origins and mission of the [[analysis_and_potential_of_the_sui_ecosystem | Sui Network]], and the broader landscape of [[the_evolving_landscape_of_web3_and_blockchain_technologies | web3 and blockchain technologies]]. Aboten also shares insights into the challenges and potential of the [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | crypto industry]], as well as personal reflections on his journey and philosophical outlook.

## Introduction to Mist Labs and Sui Network
Mist Labs is a company focused on building platforms and protocols to make the internet more decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Their primary project is the [[analysis_and_potential_of_the_sui_ecosystem | Sui Network]], a layer-one blockchain and smart contract platform designed for fast, secure, and accessible digital asset ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Aboten explains that Sui provides simple infrastructure to reduce the cost of sending money or value, serving as a necessary component for easier money transfer across the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Origins: Lessons from Libra
Adony Aboten was part of the team at Facebook (Meta) that worked on the Libra project, an ambitious initiative to build a blockchain consortium involving over 20 organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The goal was to make sending money as easy as sending an email, recognizing the potential public good of frictionless money transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.

The project ultimately failed due to public distrust of Facebook, stemming from past issues with data handling and concerns about a large corporation creating a "bank of Facebook" for two billion users, which was perceived as a significant threat to nation-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Aboten suggests that a more step-by-step approach, perhaps starting with just a blockchain or using an existing stablecoin, might have been more successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. He views blockchain as a great distribution network for the dollar, aiding dollarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>.

## Mist Labs' Vision and Approach
The core mission of Mist Labs is to build a better, more democratized internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. While the current internet excels at moving data, it's inefficient for transferring value or intent, leading to centralized monopolies in payments and data ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Mist Labs aims to create a layer that allows coordination of assets across the internet without central bodies, fostering new businesses in payments, storage, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Mist Labs adopts a multi-disciplinary approach, leveraging the diverse skills of its five co-founders, all of whom previously worked together on Libra at Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This contrasts with many crypto projects that might focus on a single discipline (e.g., programming languages or consensus algorithms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The company culture prioritizes contributions and results over corporate politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Sui Network's Technical Advantages
Aboten contends that [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | crypto]] has largely "undelivered" due to developer platforms not being expressive enough for compelling applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>. Sui addresses this by offering:
*   **Developer Experience:** Developers can build compelling applications within three to four days, even without being smart contract experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>. It's designed to be easily picked up by Web2 and Web3 developers, offering a "10x improvement in development from [[comparison_of_solana_and_sui_projects | Solana]]" according to one developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** Sui is designed to scale infinitely by adding more nodes, preventing gas fees from spiking and transactions from failing due to congestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>. It has achieved 100,000 transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Performance:** Transactions on Sui finalize within 600 milliseconds, faster than tapping a Visa card, allowing for compelling user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **Robustness:** Sui is the only chain that has never experienced downtime since its mainnet launch, and it has handled more transactions in a single day than any other blockchain in history without congestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>.

## Future Projects: Walrus Protocol
Having addressed the coordination problem with Sui, Mist Labs is now focusing on the **Walrus Protocol**, a business-default-tolerant storage layer for the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:29">[01:16:29]</a>. Walrus aims to decentralize data storage, allowing applications to be run fully decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>. It offers:
*   **Economical Storage:** Users can pay for storage as they go or in advance, and even trade storage in an open marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>.
*   **Compatibility:** Supports traditional technologies like load balancers and cache layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Allows for fully decentralized front ends, ensuring that users are interacting with non-malicious applications and preventing DNS hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.

## Broader Vision: Decentralizing the Internet
Mist Labs' overarching goal is to decentralize multiple layers of the internet:
1.  **Coordination of Assets:** Achieved with [[analysis_and_potential_of_the_sui_ecosystem | Sui Network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.
2.  **Storage:** Through Walrus Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
3.  **Networking Layer:** To prevent centralized control over traffic routing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.

Aboten aims for this multi-layer approach to compete with major internet players like Google, Amazon, and Alibaba, enabling widespread commerce on a decentralized internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.

## Views on Bitcoin and Crypto
Adony Aboten believes that [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | Bitcoin]] embodies a financial system that people deserve but don't currently have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. He highlights its lack of inflation, provable ownership, and decentralized nature, making it a "gold standard" and a better store of value than gold itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

He acknowledges that [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | crypto]] has often functioned as a "great casino," lacking genuine value-add beyond speculative "magic internet money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. DeFi, while promising, primarily benefits those with existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>. However, he is optimistic that the space is maturing with more skillful builders and high-quality projects emerging, which will lead to mass consumer adoption where users benefit from better rails without necessarily knowing they are using [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.

## Why Another Layer One?
Responding to the question of whether another Layer 1 blockchain is needed, Aboten argues that existing L1s are largely unscalable, offer poor developer experiences, and discourage success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>. He distinguishes between L1s and L2s, stating that L2s are primarily useful for the Ethereum ecosystem to address its scaling issues, though many L2s currently fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>. He believes new L1s must be scalable from day one, offering an environment for developers to experiment freely, which Sui provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.

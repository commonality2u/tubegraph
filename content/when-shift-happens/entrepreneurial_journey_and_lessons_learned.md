Nicholas Carey, the visionary behind Blockchain.com, valued at $14 billion, has been at the forefront of revolutionizing digital payments and shaping the future of decentralized finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]] provides significant insights into navigating the complexities of business and maintaining personal well-being.

## Early Beginnings and the Spirit of Entrepreneurship

Carey's first experience earning money was working on a construction field in Switzerland at 14 years old to buy DJ decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:58">[02:00:58]</a>. This tough but well-paid job taught him early lessons about "proof of work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. He notes that many people begin their [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]] by mowing lawns, setting up lemonade stands, or working on construction sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:21">[02:19:21]</a>.

The interviewer also shared an early [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | personal experience]]: collecting and selling plants from the ocean to buy a music boombox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. This experience taught lessons in inventory management, pricing, and customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Carey's journey continued with building websites in high school, learning user experience design and e-commerce platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. After university, he briefly taught computer science and creative writing in India before his "real foray" into tech [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurship]] as the second teammate at Pipeline CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This role provided a "crash course" in building company components, from sales and product design to vendor negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## Diving into the Crypto Space

In 2011, Carey learned about Bitcoin, fascinated by the intersection of money and politics and the goal of building a better financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. He believed Satoshi's vision provided an alternative to the financial system's issues post-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. He began "meaningfully working on Blockchain.com" in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges in Entrepreneurship

### The Odds Against You
Starting a business means "pretty much all odds stacked against you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. When launching a company in the early stages of a new trend like crypto, it's "even more complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Many people avoid [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurship]] due to perceived difficulty, likelihood of failure, and lack of role models, mentors, or advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:07]</a>.

> "There's no such thing as a School of Entrepreneurship. Most people will never start a company, you know, too much work, too much risk, etc." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>

The only way to know if an idea will work is to "go out and try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Like any skill, building businesses improves with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

### Unexpected Setbacks
Carey highlights that "so many things are going to happen that you're not going to be prepared for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

One "spectacular setback" for Blockchain.com was Apple's temporary blanket ban on crypto apps in the App Store in the early 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. This was a "huge challenge and a very frightening moment for the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, especially for a young and fragile startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

In a previous business, Carey faced "revenue concentration risk" with one customer accounting for 50% of all revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. Losing such a client creates significant challenges, leaving behind a product tailored specifically for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

### Crypto Market Cycles
The crypto industry is characterized by "bull runs and then bear markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>. Carey has seen over seven instances in his decade-plus career where crypto prices dropped by over 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

## [[Entrepreneurship Lessons in the Crypto Space | Entrepreneurship Lessons]] and Mindset

### Learning Mindset
Carey emphasizes approaching problems from a learning perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. Problems are not personal attacks but "opportunities that are presenting themselves for you to learn about and overcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. These challenges are "almost as gifts, despite how much that they may suck at the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. Accumulating these lessons allows entrepreneurs to approach similar problems and avoid past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

### Customer Feedback and Business Model
It's crucial to get "very candid feedback" about business ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Ultimately, customers provide the best feedback, as a business needs to build "something that people find useful and that they're willing to pay you for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

### Optimism and Open Mindset
Maintaining an "optimistic and open mindset" is key for the entire journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. If obstacles are seen as the path and challenges as opportunities, one can move from problem to problem, getting better at solving increasingly larger issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.

### Responsibility and Leadership
Raising capital significantly "grows your responsibility envelope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. When hiring, every dollar is precious, and the goal is to find people "equally passionate about the work and very capable of achieving things they're better at doing it than you would be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>.

Letting go of teammates, especially during economic downturns, is "one of the hardest things a Founder can ever do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.

Leadership involves cultivating a personal style, setting a vision, strategic alignment, and moving everyone towards a future that doesn't yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.

## [[Personal Reflections on Entrepreneurship and Mindset | Mental Health and Well-being]]

[[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | Entrepreneurship]] can be "particularly taxing" for individuals prone to "extraordinary anxiety or stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Stress can be motivating, but becoming overwhelmed can lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

### Developing a Healthy Relationship with Work
Carey shares that it "took me a long time to develop a healthy relationship with my work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. His work was "completely all-consuming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, leading to severe sleep challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. He eventually addressed a sleeping condition by undergoing a sleep study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

It's crucial to have a personal program for mental health, as judgment can become clouded without self-care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>. His routine includes:
*   Waking up and exercising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>.
*   Healthy nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>.
*   Expressing gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:04:00">[26:04:00]</a>.
*   Physically stressing the body (e.g., long-distance running) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>.

> "You only get one body... you only have one body and it'll start to tell you when things aren't going well and you better listen to your face." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>

### Warning Signs and Support
Entrepreneurs should pay attention to alarm bells such as:
*   Consistent tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28:00">[33:28:00]</a>.
*   Snapping at people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:00">[33:33:00]</a>.
*   A physically messy personal environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>.

It's important to find someone trustworthy to discuss weaknesses, whether physical or mental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>. Professionals for mental and physical health can help identify and prescribe improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>. A strong, long-term support network of friends, family, or community members is vital for identifying patterns and being open about challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>.

> "The whole work to yourself and death culture is stupid if you're dead you can't work on your project no one's going to care." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:00">[34:56:00]</a>

### Moving from Wartime to Peacetime Mode
A leader's "bull-headedness" and ability to power through are sometimes necessary during periods of extreme vulnerability for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>. However, leaders must know when to "move out of wartime mode and go back into peacetime mode and repair your energy reserves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:22:00">[31:22:00]</a>.

## Building Resilience

Resilience can be built through consistent practice and discipline, similar to how physical challenges, like running a marathon, build mental fortitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:25:00">[38:25:00]</a>. The true challenge is not just running one marathon, but running one "every single year for 30 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>. This concept applies to various difficult professions beyond [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_overcoming_industry_challenges | entrepreneurship]], such as doctors, teachers, and scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:33:00">[39:33:00]</a>.

The gains from discipline grow incrementally, a compounding effect often called the "one percent rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>. Starting these habits early in life (e.g., 20s) and maintaining them is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>. Telling others your goals and asking them to hold you accountable can also help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:15:00">[40:15:00]</a>. Setbacks are inevitable, but the key is to "amend yourself and... get back on the program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a>.

## Personal "Failure"

Carey admits a personal "failure" is his inability to concentrate on long-form content like books, due to habitually consuming short-form information on screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>. This reflects a broader societal challenge amplified by social media, where many people develop a "sort of ADHD" from constant exposure to brief, dopamine-hitting content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:00]</a>.

## The Vision of Entrepreneurship

Carey sees [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurship]] as "such an exciting and full vehicle for changing and improving the state of the world in society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. He believes we need "a lot more entrepreneurs building services and goods and challenging the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>. Organizations like Sky's the Limit.org, where he is Chairman and Co-founder, focus on supporting first-time entrepreneurs with mentorship, advice, and grant funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:17:00">[51:17:00]</a>.

He holds a controversial belief that "we can build a better form of money" using technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>. This alternative, he argues, can be more efficient, rely on sound principles, treat everyone equally, and possess humanistic traits, making it a better way to exchange wealth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:35:00">[49:35:00]</a>.

Ultimately, his message is that [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurship]] is an "incredible path" for agency and creativity, and that those on this journey are "not alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>. He encourages building a mindset to get through tough times to capitalize on opportunities when they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:55:00">[51:55:00]</a>.

Venture investing in the crypto space involves identifying and supporting exceptional individuals and their teams who are building successful products and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Success for a venture capitalist (VC) is directly tied to the success of the founders and their projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. This field is described as "quintessentially positive-sum," as the primary goal is to help others succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## Dragonfly: A Global Crypto Investment Fund

Dragonfly is a global venture fund that backs founders in the very early stages of their projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:0">[00:31:0]</a>. Hasib Khesi, a managing partner at Dragonfly, states that the firm has gained significant recognition within the crypto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Dragonfly has a presence in both Asia and the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a> and is known for being one of the most technical venture capital firms, as well as an early and high-conviction investor in various crypto sectors, including DeFi, Layer 1s, Layer 2s, and exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

Early investments by Dragonfly include Avalanche, NEAR Protocol, Dune Analytics, Monad, Aptos, and Mantle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Hasib Khesi joined Dragonfly early in its existence, helping to shape it into the fund he envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.

## The Nature of Venture Investing

Venture investing in crypto has a "very slow feedback loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:0">[00:42:0]</a>. When investing in a founder at the seed stage, it can take years to determine if the decision was correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:0">[00:48:0]</a>. This contrasts sharply with activities like poker or trading, where feedback is almost instantaneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:0">[00:50:0]</a>. The delayed gratification in venture capital means there isn't typically a "big bang moment" of success; rather, it's a gradual process of watching a project grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>.

### People Business
Venture capital is fundamentally a "people business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. Understanding people is deeply ingrained in human brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:32">[01:0:32]</a>. Experienced VCs learn to trust their instincts about founders, looking past social credentialing and superficial impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:0">[01:14:0]</a>. The ability to assess how a founder will act under stress, uncertainty, or moral dilemmas is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

### The Power of the Investor
Investors hold a unique "magic power" because they are outside the internal structure of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. They can provide an external, objective viewpoint that internal team members or co-founders might struggle to convey to a CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:49">[01:41:49]</a>. This outside perspective can be incredibly valuable, even if it's simply stating the obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.

## Hasib Khesi's Journey and Lessons

Hasib Khesi has had multiple careers, including professional poker player, software engineer, and entrepreneur, before becoming a VC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

### From Poker to Crypto
Khesi quit poker after an incident where he unknowingly defended a cheating protégé, which damaged his reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:0">[01:04:0]</a>. He also felt disillusioned with poker as a career path, realizing he didn't want to look back at 50 having only "played cards and taken other people's money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. He decided to give away most of his money, leaving himself with $10,000 to force himself to reinvent his life without a financial cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>. Part of the money was donated, and part was given to his parents for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:0">[01:47:0]</a>.

This experience taught him that money alone does not bring happiness; connections, relationships, family, and friends are what truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:0">[01:11:0]</a>. He found that a basic level of material wealth (around $50,000-$100,000 annually) is sufficient for happiness, beyond which increased income has logarithmically diminishing returns on well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:0">[01:36:0]</a>. His happiness was more linked to learning new things and working towards goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:0">[01:51:0]</a>.

### Unstructured Learning
Khesi identifies his "superpower" as unstructured learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:0">[01:54:0]</a>. This is learning in fields where there are no clear courses or textbooks, requiring individuals to "figure it out groping in the darkness and learning as you go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:0">[02:07:0]</a>. He applied this in poker, where education was nascent, and similarly in early crypto, where resources were scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:0">[02:11:0]</a>. This type of learning, where one creates their own curriculum through experimentation and immersion, is often the most valuable and highly rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:0">[02:22:0]</a>.

### Imposter Syndrome
Khesi notes that imposter syndrome is common, especially when in a position of influence like an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:0">[01:40:0]</a>. He deals with it by acknowledging the feeling but proceeding anyway, recognizing that not having imposter syndrome might indicate a lack of self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:40">[01:0:40]</a>.

## Principles for Success in Crypto

Hasib Khesi offers key principles for anyone looking to "make it" in crypto:

1.  **Get More Technical**: Understanding the underlying technology is crucial for building robust mental models and predicting future trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Learning some coding or understanding how programs and computers work helps in discerning real possibilities from "bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Start Writing and Talking in Public**: Overcoming the fear of not knowing enough and starting to share knowledge publicly is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. Even if the initial content is "embarrassing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>, there are always people a few steps behind who can benefit from what you've just learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. This builds a reputation and connections, adding value to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.

### The "Crypto Native" Advantage
Khesi observes that almost everything important in crypto has been built by "crypto natives" – "weirdos" who are deeply immersed in the space, rather than highly credentialed individuals from traditional tech or finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. To become a crypto native, individuals should identify their unique "superpower" or skill and find a way to immediately add value to someone in crypto who needs that specific skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. The focus should be on building one's own career based on strengths, rather than imitating others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.

### Influence vs. Followers
In the crypto space, social media followers do not always equate to real influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>. Many high-follower accounts are "engagement farmers" with little real power to effect change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. Conversely, true "movers and shakers" often have fewer followers but possess significant real-world influence, operating largely behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>. This phenomenon, similar to the difference between being "rich" and "wealthy," suggests that genuine influence comes from adding value to interactions, projects, and people, rather than through self-promotion or vanity metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

### Lessons from Missed Opportunities
One of the most painful experiences for a VC is a "bad pass" – missing an investment in a project that goes on to achieve massive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. Khesi cites passing on the Uniswap Series A round as his most psychologically weighing miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. Despite having "smart takes" and data that seemed to justify the pass at the time, they failed to grasp the transformative potential of a "completely mechanized system for anybody to be able to list and trade anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. This experience reinforced that raw data or analytical "correctness" might not always capture the true, disruptive power of an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.

In [[investment_strategies_in_crypto_markets | Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets]], Khesi advises against trying to time the market perfectly for exits, suggesting that aiming to exit within "40-50% of the top" is a successful outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>. The bigger mistake, he argues, is holding on for too long and riding through an entire boom-bust cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.

## The Philosophy and Future of Crypto

Khesi views crypto as "intrinsically subversive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:18">[01:56:18]</a>. Unlike most technologies throughout history that tend to strengthen the state, crypto aims to shift the balance of power from governments back to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:22">[01:56:22]</a>. Crypto exists as a response to governmental constraints on money and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55">[01:56:55]</a>. This inherent subversiveness makes crypto challenging to "tame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:35">[01:58:35]</a>.

Despite potential downsides like increased chaos or hacking due to uncensorable and unstoppable money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>, Khesi believes crypto is "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:26">[01:56:26]</a>. He compares it to social media's inevitability, regardless of one's opinion on its overall benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:36">[01:53:36]</a>.

For the next 12 months, Khesi anticipates a "slow march of crypto adoption" rather than explosive growth seen in previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:36">[01:39:36]</a>. He notes the significant progress made, such as traditional financial institutions like BlackRock now discussing Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. While risk appetite and interest rates could instigate a new cycle, his base case is continued growth, albeit less "crazy" than the 2021 cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>.

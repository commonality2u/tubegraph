Alex Felle, the Chief Partnership Officer at SwissBorg, a leading European crypto wealth management platform with over 1 million users worldwide, attributes much of his [[personal_growth_and_the_impact_of_life_experiences_on_work_and_happiness | personal growth]] and vision to his extensive international experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Having lived in the US, Japan, France, the UK, and now Dubai, Felle emphasizes that grappling with life's challenges, both personal and professional, is crucial for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Adversity and Embracing Struggles

Felle believes that [[personal_growth_through_adversity | struggles]] are "absolutely a must" for creating something greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. He shares that growing up with a younger, smarter, and more handsome brother, Cyrus Felle (Co-Founder of SwissBorg), pushed him to find other strengths and embrace teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. His upbringing with a single mother from the age of nine and a half also forged his character and brought him and his brother closer, demonstrating how difficult events can strengthen familial bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

He views life as a continuous "dance" between the dark and white, similar to the Yin and Yang concept, where struggles inevitably lead to positive conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. This perspective extends to business and investment cycles, where downturns, though challenging, always present opportunities for growth and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

## Learning Beyond Traditional Education

Felle holds a critical view of the traditional education system, calling it "garbage" for its failure to prioritize self-understanding and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. He argues that schools should focus on helping individuals discover their identity and purpose, rather than teaching "useless" subjects like grammar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

He highlights the importance of [[personal_growth_through_holistic_approaches_and_alternative_medicine | self-discovery]] through diverse experiences and reading. A pivotal moment in his education was a cross-cultural communication class that revealed the vast differences between cultures, particularly the low-context US and high-context Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. This sparked his decade-long immersion in Japan, a country he chose precisely because it was the "polar opposite" of his own cultural background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

### The Japanese Immersion: A Masterclass in Emotional Intelligence and Discipline

Living in Japan for ten years was a profound [[personal_growth_and_recovery_experiences | personal development]] journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. Felle emphasizes that studying the language is key to understanding a culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. He learned about Japan's non-confrontational communication style, where direct "no" is replaced with "perhaps" or "maybe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

His biggest takeaway from Japan was the development of **emotional intelligence (EQ)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. Unlike warm-blooded cultures like France where emotions are openly expressed, Japanese culture emphasizes control, leading to high EQ but also potential internalization of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. He also greatly admired their **dedication, determination**, and "gambatte kure" (the energy to do your best) mindset, which involves pushing through tasks without immediate rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.

> "Struggling is the process of creating something greater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

Felle's time in Japan also shed light on cultural coping mechanisms, such as the prevalence of public intoxication, which he attributes to the need for emotional release after internalizing feelings during the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>.

## Cultivating a Multi-Dimensional Perspective

Felle believes the most important skill he developed through his travels is seeing the world from a "multi-dimensional way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>. This involves understanding different perspectives and empathizing with others' feelings, a skill he believes even AI will struggle to fully replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

He attributes his transformation from an introvert to someone adept at public speaking and connection primarily to extensive reading, particularly [[personal_growth_and_life_frameworks | self-help and personal development books]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>. He dedicated four to five years to reading, taking notes, and setting actionable steps to apply theoretical knowledge to his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>.

## Key Self-Help Books for Growth and Influence

Felle recommends three foundational books that shaped his approach to life and business:

### 1. *Think and Grow Rich* by Napoleon Hill
This book, inspired by *As a Man Thinketh*, was a "core pillar to self-help" for Felle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>. Hill spent 20 years studying successful thinkers of the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>. The key takeaway for Felle is the power of setting goals, visualizing success, and anticipating struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>. He attests to the "Law of Attraction," noting that when he intensely focused on his goals, "weird things happened" that led to their realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>.

### 2. *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen Covey
This book provides a framework for effective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>. Felle particularly values the **win-win principle**, which he sees as crucial for successful partnerships, including Bitcoin's multi-dimensional success for miners, investors, and transactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>. He emphasizes shifting perspective from survival to giving and thinking long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:00">[32:04:00]</a>. Felle even advocates for a "lose-win" approach, believing in the "law of reciprocity" (from Robert Cialdini's *Influence*) where giving value often results in eventual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:49:00">[34:49:00]</a>.

### 3. *How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie
This book provides practical advice on human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:18:00">[40:18:00]</a>. A major insight for Felle is that everyone's fundamental drive is to **feel important and included** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>. Making others feel important, through genuine praise or active listening, builds strong connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:46:00">[41:46:00]</a>. He recounts an extreme example of connecting with a powerful media executive simply by asking questions and allowing the person to talk extensively about their interests, leading to the executive feeling it was "one of the greatest conversations" despite Felle speaking only "one or two percent of the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>.

## Financial and Investment Philosophy

Felle strongly recommends Tony Robbins' *Money: Master the Game* for understanding investing basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:25:00">[44:25:00]</a>. He advocates for investing in low-cost diversified funds (ETFs) and emphasizes the importance of knowing one's "magic number" for financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:00">[46:16:00]</a>. He believes that [[the_impact_of_money_on_personal_growth | financial freedom]] is rarely achieved through a salary alone; rather, it comes from owning a piece of a business, either by building one or investing in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:02:00">[50:02:00]</a>.

Felle's [[financial_and_personal_growth_overcoming_challenges_and_learning_from_mistakes | investment strategy]] in crypto is grounded in understanding market cycles, recognizing that "everything is cyclical in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:25:00">[55:25:00]</a>. He stresses the importance of emotional control, particularly battling greed at market highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. His hard-learned lesson from the 2016-2018 altcoin cycle was the danger of "catching the falling knife" and not selling at opportune times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>.

Key red flags to watch for when selling crypto include:
*   **Widespread media attention and mainstream adoption:** When taxi drivers and old friends start asking about buying Bitcoin, it's a "huge flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.
*   **Excess capital flow into projects with zero fundamentals:** Money pouring into "garbage" projects with crazy valuations is a signal to "get out ASAP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.

Felle applies a "contrarian investing" approach, doing the opposite of the majority, especially when there's "death of Solana" or "death of Bitcoin" sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. He uses three metrics to guide his decisions:
1.  **Total market capitalization:** Projecting future market cap (e.g., $6 trillion for crypto) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.
2.  **Single asset all-time high capitalization:** Assessing individual token potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.
3.  **Duration of the euphoria stage:** Recognizing the 6 to 12-month parabolic phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>.

He emphasizes the [[mindset_and_personal_growth_in_entrepreneurship | importance of programming one's mind]] to anticipate suffering and maintain a long-term outlook when investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:45">[01:51:45]</a>.

## The Future of Investing: Democratizing Wealth and Social Capital

Felle envisions a future of investing that democratizes wealth and leverages social capital, moving away from centralized VC (Venture Capital) models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:04">[01:26:04]</a>. He believes that the "community needs to be able to be a part of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. Platforms like SwissBorg Alpha aim to enable community investment, arguing that users are often more loyal and less likely to "dump" tokens than traditional VCs who have short-term "buy and sell" agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>.

He highlights the rise of content creators and YouTubers as financial advisors for new generations, signifying a shift in influence from traditional financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>. Felle believes that in this new model, individuals can bring value to projects not just through money, but through "social capital" and "influence" by building their own communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>. This creates a "meritocratic model" where contributors with strong social backing can participate early in projects, leading to a truly decentralized and community-driven investment landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a>.

Phantom, once considered the fastest blockchain available at its release in 2018, aimed to compete with and scale Ethereum by offering a faster blockchain solution [00:20:52]. However, it has since been superseded by its successor, Sonic, to which all development efforts have migrated [01:01:58].

## Phantom Blockchain

At its core, [[the_role_of_phantom_in_the_solana_ecosystem | Phantom]]'s consensus mechanism was designed for speed, capable of processing between 50,000 and 60,000 raw transfer transactions per second (TPS) [00:56:11]. Despite this potential, its actual maximum throughput was hard-capped at 200 TPS due to limitations imposed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) [00:56:16].

By the time of its release, the blockchain space was vastly different, rendering Phantom no longer viable as a product for current market demands [01:02:37]. The original team spent a significant portion of their initial funding, partly due to the value decline of ETH, which they had raised and held [00:22:22]. By late 2019, when the technical team fully took over, only about $2 million of the initial $40 million raised remained [00:22:57].

Although [[the_role_of_phantom_in_the_solana_ecosystem | Phantom]] will continue to exist as a decentralized blockchain for as long as validators operate, the team's focus and attention have entirely shifted to [[development_of_the_sonic_blockchain | Sonic]] [01:02:03].

## The Transition to Sonic

The primary reason for the transition from [[the_role_of_phantom_in_the_solana_ecosystem | Phantom]] to [[development_of_the_sonic_blockchain | Sonic]] was the EVM bottleneck [00:56:21]. The team dedicated time to rewriting the virtual machine to create a more efficient and capable infrastructure [00:56:23].

## Sonic Blockchain

[[development_of_the_sonic_blockchain | Sonic]] is positioned as the best blockchain currently available [00:34:00], excelling in:
*   **Speed** [00:36:38]
    *   Fastest consensus [00:55:40]
    *   Lowest Time to Finality (TTF) [00:55:40]
    *   Fastest read/writes [00:55:42]
    *   Theoretically, [[development_of_the_sonic_blockchain | Sonic]] can achieve 400,000 transactions per second [00:41:41].
    *   Its time to finality is sub-200 milliseconds, which is faster than human responsiveness can recognize, meaning a click results in an instantaneous completion [00:57:25].
*   **Technical Architecture** [00:56:23]
    *   It retains Solidity and Viper compatibility while running on an entirely new underlying virtual machine [00:56:29].
    *   Unlike most blockchains, [[development_of_the_sonic_blockchain | Sonic]]'s Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) are synchronous, providing immediate responses to user actions without the need for constant polling [00:58:04]. This significantly enhances the user experience [00:58:12].

### DApp Developer Focus and User Experience

[[development_of_the_sonic_blockchain | Sonic]] is designed from the perspective of a DApp developer, prioritizing features that improve application functionality and user experience [00:58:25]:
*   **Fee Monetization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>: Developers receive 90% of the transaction fees generated by their applications, with the remaining 10% going to validators for network security. This revenue stream enables developers to subsidize user actions or create new business models [00:59:01].
*   **Fee Subsidies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>: DApps can subsidize user transactions, removing the need for users to hold a wallet or gas tokens. This lowers the barrier to entry, as users can interact with applications directly without complex setup [00:59:15].
*   **Native Account Abstraction with Economic Abstraction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>: Users can access DApps using familiar authentication methods like Google, email, password, fingerprint, or face recognition, eliminating the need to understand blockchain concepts like wallets or native tokens [01:00:00].

While these features add a slight overhead, making the blockchain technically "slower" in raw performance, the focus is on maintaining sufficient capacity to meet demand and, more importantly, enhancing the user experience and user interface [01:00:24]. The aim is to attract more users by providing a seamless experience, ultimately leading to greater demand that can utilize the blockchain's capacity [01:00:47]. The speed, while impressive, is considered less critical than the overall user experience [01:00:55].

The process of listing a crypto token on an exchange presents significant [[Challenges and risks in the crypto industry | challenges]] and can be a source of "biggest disappointment in crypto" for builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>. This is primarily due to the immense leverage exchanges hold over projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.

## The Truth About Exchanges and Listing

From the perspective of a builder, the token listing process is often perceived as "quite rigged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>. While one might initially assume that acceptance is based purely on metrics and criteria, the reality is more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.

### Exchange Influence on Tokenomics
Exchanges significantly influence the tokenomics of projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. A common requirement is for tokens to launch with a small circulating supply, often around 5% or 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. This is because a smaller initial supply is believed to lead to better performance by ensuring higher buy pressure than sell pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. This trend of thin circulating supply at launch, followed by large inflation, is directly "Guided by exchanges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. Projects often comply with these demands because they deem the listing worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

Exchanges also aim to secure a good share of the tokens initially and want to know precisely who holds them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.

### The Importance of Connections
A crucial, yet unofficial, aspect of the listing process is "who you know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. A project can face significant delays and lack of interest from an exchange, only for the process to be completed swiftly once the "right person" is contacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. This highlights that a small "handful of people" possess substantial power over listing decisions, capable of providing strong internal nudges to get things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.

### Prerequisites for Listing
While connections are vital, projects must still meet certain minimum thresholds of quality, users, and traction to be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>. However, even with a strong project, a lack of the necessary contacts can mean a project has "no leverage" in the listing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. This is further compounded by the limited number of top exchanges (the top five, or even top three) that control most of the market's liquidity, and whose listing teams are relatively small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

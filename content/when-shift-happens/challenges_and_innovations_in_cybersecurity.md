Nars Protocol, co-founded by its CEO, aims to establish a universal trust system to address fundamental problems in digital security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The company has raised $36 million, with significant investment from figures like Tim Draper, a notable Bitcoin OG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

## Speaker's Journey in Cybersecurity

The CEO's interest in technology began at a young age in rural Portugal, where he learned programming because his computer couldn't run games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. At around 10 years old, he created his first malicious code, a "virus" called "Sunday" (which activated on Saturdays due to a misunderstanding of English) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Its goal was to scare users by displaying a message about their hard drive being formatted, without actually destroying data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

His career evolved into senior roles in cybersecurity departments, including serving as the Chief Security Officer (CSO) at London City Airport as a contractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. He also held the position of global chief security for the OCS group, a company with over 100,000 employees worldwide, which taught him the difficulties of managing highly decentralized organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This experience reinforced his belief that the world should move towards decentralized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment leading to the creation of Nars Protocol was realizing he was happy when too sick to go to work, indicating a need for change from traditional corporate culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This led to his "Zero A-hole Policy" (ZAP) in his own company, prioritizing character and mutual support within the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

He also advised NATO member states on cyber warfare and terrorism, attending critical events with country leaders where ideas about using decentralization to mitigate risks in central systems were discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. These interactions, particularly with military officials, revealed a greater openness to experimentation compared to corporate environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

## Fundamental Challenges in Cybersecurity

### The Challenge of Trust
A core distinction is made between "security" and "trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. While security aims to protect, the fundamental question remains: "How do you know you can trust" the security mechanism or individual? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. In digital systems, there's currently no mathematical way to prove the integrity of a system, application, or process at any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This reliance on legacy assumptions adds significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

### Centralization as a Foundational Problem
The speaker asserts that [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | centralization]] is the foundational problem in current security paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. All physical controls are dependent on digital controls, and these often operate from centralized points of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. For example, even though blockchains themselves might not be broken in hacks, the centralized validators or exchanges supporting them are often vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

> "Every device in the world... If it's digital and it's connected to a network, it's a single point of failure to everything it is connected to." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>

The increasing complexity of the world and the proliferation of IoT (Internet of Things, referred to as "Internet of Trouble") mean more entry points and greater difficulty in defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### The Quantum Threat to Cryptography
Current global cryptography relies on elliptic curve cryptography, which is strong against classical computers but vulnerable to future quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

*   **Vulnerability:** Quantum computers excel at mathematics and could break cryptographic keys that protect valuable data, including private keys on blockchains, encrypted messages, nuclear codes, or even Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **Data Harvesting:** Data encrypted with current methods can be harvested now and decrypted in the future (2-7 years) once powerful enough quantum computers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Imbalance:** This poses the risk of the biggest geopolitical imbalance in lifetimes, as all global secrets could potentially be accessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **Blockchain Weakness:** Blockchains are not exempt; their cryptography is currently weak against quantum attacks, and transactions (hashes) are public, making them targets for double-spending or alteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

[!WARNING|The coming quantum era]
China has reportedly spent more on quantum technologies in recent years than on its nuclear arsenal, and similar expenditures are seen in the EU and US, underscoring its strategic importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. In the US, laws mandate that all entities dealing with the government must be post-quantum safe by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Trust in AI Systems
A significant **challenge** with AI systems is the lack of assurance regarding data sources, potential tampering with models, and the integrity of questions and answers exchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Innovations in Cybersecurity: Nars Protocol's Solution

Nars Protocol is positioned as a foundational technology that offers a new paradigm of trust, applicable transversally across any digital system or operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Universal Trust System
Nars Protocol is described as a "universal trust system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. It leverages existing decentralized systems and applies strong mathematical principles to create consensus and prove the "good state" of processes, servers, and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This means proving trust in the truth being presented, unlike current systems that rely on assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### Post-Quantum Blockchain
Nars Protocol claims to be the first post-quantum blockchain in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This innovation involves using different mathematical algorithms resistant to quantum chip attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

*   **Sub-Zero Layer:** Nars Protocol adds a "metal layer" or "sub-zero layer" that can elevate any existing Layer 1 or Layer 2 blockchain to a post-quantum level from the infrastructure side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This addresses the vulnerability of underlying centralized validators, ensuring they can prove their trustworthiness to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Transaction Protection:** The technology also applies post-quantum protection to transactions themselves, mitigating risks like double-spending or alteration by quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

### Broader Impact Across Industries
The technology's impact extends beyond Web3 to critical sectors like telecommunications, software development, robotics, car manufacturing, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This is crucial for environments where compromise could lead to physical harm, such as smart cars being hacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

### Trust by Design
The future, envisioned as "Web 4," is expected to be a quantum-driven internet with "trust by design" and "AI by design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. Nars Protocol aims to provide the fundamental change needed to achieve this, offering assurance and trust from the ground up for any digital system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

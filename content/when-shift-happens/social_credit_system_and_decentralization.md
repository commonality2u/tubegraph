David Shin, a leader at Immutable X and advisor to central banks, discusses the concept of a social credit system, particularly how it could be implemented in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## A Proposed Decentralized Social Credit System

Shin suggests a radical re-engineering of the world's economic incentive model, envisioning a market where individuals are incentivized to "do good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. This "good" behavior would build up social creditworthiness, granting greater access to resources or opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. The more one contributes to the greater good, the more one is incentivized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.

This system, he believes, could be implemented through crypto and [[decentralization_and_its_impact_on_social_media | decentralizing]] the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.
His idea involves:
*   **Token-based System**: Utilizing "red, amber, and green tokens" that hold no monetary value but possess significant social value within an ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.
*   **Public Addresses as Identification**: A public wallet address, without necessarily requiring KYC, could serve as a single point of identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.
*   **Community Vetting**: Individuals in the ecosystem would assign tokens based on observed behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>:
    *   **Green Tokens**: Awarded for positive contributions like funding, donating, or building open-source projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.
    *   **Red Tokens**: Given for actions deemed "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
    *   **Yellow Tokens**: Serve as a warning or a second chance, similar to a yellow card in football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Wallets would publicly display the number of red, green, and yellow tokens, allowing for community monitoring of behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

### Decentralized vs. Centralized Control

Shin explicitly contrasts this vision with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which he views as "very government controlled" and centralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. His proposed system aims to be decentralized, akin to a "community program where everyone in the neighborhood's just watching out for each other" and policing their own behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. This approach, he argues, is the "best way to decentralize yet monitor behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.

## Challenges and Human Nature

Despite the potential, Shin acknowledges the difficulties in implementing such a system. He notes that a large portion of the world acts with ulterior motives, making genuine, community-led regulation challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Furthermore, many people are followers who seek "cult figures" or "idols" to lead them, which might impede a truly decentralized, self-governing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>.

He draws a parallel to current social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook, where "likes" dominate, and negative feedback ("dislikes") is largely absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>. This, he contends, is because platforms "can't monetize off hate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>, reinforcing a system geared towards profit.

## Risks of Unregulated Online Behavior

Shin warns that without some form of regulation, or a social credit system, the online world will continue to be toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. He suggests that the lack of fundamental human principles being upheld online could lead to rising instances of depression and mental health issues, potentially linked to social bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

### Personal Values for a Balanced Perspective

As a parent, Shin emphasizes the importance of teaching his children to be rational and logical, encouraging them to take a balanced approach to information. This means consuming diverse news sources (e.g., Fox News and CNN, Washington Post and RTS) to self-regulate and form a 360-degree view of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This personal self-regulation is crucial in a world where AI-generated fake information is becoming increasingly prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

The concept of a social credit system, particularly when decentralized through crypto, presents a way to encourage positive behavior and community accountability online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. However, its implementation faces challenges rooted in human nature and the profit-driven motives of existing platforms. Shin notes that while blockchain and Web3 technologies offer the potential for positive global shifts, they also carry the risk of increased traceability and governmental control, making them a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

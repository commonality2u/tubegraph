Kain Warwick, co-founder and CEO of Infinex, describes the platform as a "crypto everything app" and a "One-Stop shop to store, use, and trade over 1,000 crypto assets across any chain with just a few clicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Infinex aims to be a "better way to do crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Motivation Behind Infinex

Warwick expresses deep dissatisfaction that the blockchain infrastructure built with "Blood, Sweat and Tears" is "not being used" by the wider world, remaining instead in a "little bubble of enthusiasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. He views crypto as an [[vision_and_innovation_in_blockchain_technology | enabling technology]] that requires [[redefining_crypto_for_wider_adoption | mass adoption]] to truly make an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

A significant driver for Warwick is a sense of obligation to "fix my mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, acknowledging that he "helped to create a lot of the dumb ideas that are keeping us trapped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. He sees Infinex as his answer to the "disaster that happened 2 years ago" in the crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>. His mission is to "take defi and on-chain platforms to the next level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## Addressing Market Structure and Incentives

Warwick believes the current market structure in crypto is "broken" and "the incentives are f***ed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. He describes the industry as being in an "inadequate equilibrium" where existing players are trapped by harmful incentive loops and cannot break out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This leads to scenarios like projects raising capital at undervalued rates, limiting broader participation, and creating perverse incentives for users to "farm" and "dump" tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

Kain Warwick's perspective is that this problem is not being addressed by those who are financially incentivized to maintain the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. He advocates for an approach that "lets people buy tokens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.

Infinex's solution to this broken market structure is to create a "game like points" system that allows people to gain access to buying tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. This "access process" requires users to "give something" in exchange for a "ticket to participate," aiming to ensure that only those who "genuinely understand what they're participating in" are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.

## Infinex's Role in Future Crypto Adoption

Warwick envisions Infinex as the platform that facilitates mainstream adoption for crypto, especially for individuals who are not "enthusiasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. He cites his own mother, who has Bitcoin on a centralized exchange, as an example of a user who needs a non-custodial solution that is safe and accessible for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

The "Holy Grail" for Infinex would be a future where, at the peak of the next crypto cycle, people feel comfortable recommending Infinex to their friends and family as the go-to platform to buy Bitcoin and engage with crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. This directly addresses the issue of past "disasters" where many people "blew up" and left the space, as Infinex aims to provide a secure and user-friendly entry point that could help bring new users into the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.

Warwick maintains that Infinex is his way of continuing to "grind" through the problems in the crypto space, fueled by a desire to prove wrong those who doubt the industry's ability to evolve and reach mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a>.

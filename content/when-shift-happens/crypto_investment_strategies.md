Making money in the crypto market without relying on luck requires a deep understanding of its unique dynamics and a refined approach to investment. Hasu, Managing Partner at Dragonfly, a global crypto-focused investment fund, and co-host of "The Chopping Block," shares insights on how to navigate the [[Investment strategies in the crypto market|crypto investment]] landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Core of Venture Investing in Crypto

For venture capitalists, the path to success lies in identifying and supporting exceptional individuals. "What you're doing in Venture is you're finding great people and you're helping them succeed and the only reason why you'll win is that these people and their teams and their products become successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This makes venture a "positive sum" endeavor, transforming what can often feel like a "zero sum" or "single player game" in crypto into a collaborative, "multiplayer game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

Venture investing has a very slow feedback loop, unlike trading or poker, where outcomes are almost immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. It can take years to determine if an investment in a seed-stage startup was correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>.

## Essential Principles for Success in Crypto Investing

Hasu outlines several key principles for anyone looking to "make it" in crypto:

### 1. Get More Technical

Understanding the underlying technology is paramount. "If you don't understand the technology you are not going to be able to have a robust mental model of where it's going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. This involves studying the history of technology, learning basic coding to grasp how programs and computers work, and developing an intuition for what is technically feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. This technical foundation helps in predicting market direction and discerning genuine projects from hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### 2. Start Writing and Talking in Public

Many hesitate to share their thoughts publicly, believing they lack sufficient knowledge or original ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>. However, Hasu emphasizes that this is a "huge mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>. There will always be people slightly behind you in their learning journey who can benefit from your insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. Sharing your learning progress, even if it feels "dumb" or "embarrassing" at first, helps build connections, notoriety, and a deeper engagement with the [[Evolution of the cryptocurrency market and personal investment strategies|crypto industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>.

### 3. Trust Your Instincts (Especially with People)

While understanding businesses and technology is challenging for junior investors, understanding people is deeply ingrained in human brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Experienced VCs learn to trust their gut feelings about individuals, recognizing subtle signals of trustworthiness or the lack thereof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The ability to see past "social credentialing" and assess a founder's character under stress or moral dilemmas is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### 4. Recognize and Leverage "Unstructured Learning"

Traditional schooling focuses on "structured learning" with clear textbooks and tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. However, most valuable real-world jobs, especially in emerging fields like crypto, require "unstructured learning"—figuring things out by "groping in the darkness," experimenting, taking risks, and iterating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:45">[02:04:45]</a>. This ability to learn without a clear curriculum is highly rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. Crypto, like early poker, demanded this self-directed learning approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>.

### 5. Focus on Your Superpower and Add Value

Instead of trying to transform into a "crypto-shaped person" by learning every technical detail, individuals should identify their unique "superpower"—their core strengths and talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>. The strategy then becomes to "sharpen that into a very, very fine point and then figure out how can I take this skill that I have and find the one person in crypto who most needs this and do it for them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>. This entrepreneurial approach of identifying a problem and providing value is the most effective way to build a career and influence in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.

### 6. Prioritize Adding Value Over Seeking Influence

True influence in crypto is not about vanity metrics like social media followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. While engagement can be high, real "movers and shakers" often operate quietly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. The most effective way to gain influence is by consistently adding value to every interaction, project, and individual you work with. "You add value to everybody you meet to every interaction you have to every project that you work with and that is what builds your reputation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.

## Other Key Considerations for [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets|Crypto Markets]]

*   **Self-Custody of Assets:** The single most important lesson for a serious [[Investment strategies in cryptocurrency|crypto investing]] journey is to learn how to self-custody assets, ideally using a hardware wallet (cold storage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The adage "Not your keys, not your coin" highlights the risk of losing crypto if it's held by a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **The Nature of Crypto Natives:** The most important innovations in crypto are "almost always" built by "crypto natives" or "weirdos" who are deeply immersed in the space, rather than highly credentialed individuals from traditional tech or finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.
*   **Money and Happiness:** Having large sums of money, quickly acquired, does not guarantee happiness. Personal progress, growth, and strong relationships with friends and family are far greater drivers of meaning and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. While money solves "money problems," beyond a basic level of material wealth (e.g., $50,000-$100,000 a year for middle-class existence in a first-world country), happiness tends to fall off logarithmically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:13">[03:13:13]</a>.
*   **Market Timing for Exits:** When it comes to exiting positions, the goal should not be to hit the absolute top. Aiming to exit "within 40%-50% of the top" is considered a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. The more common and significant mistake for investors is "riding this thing all the way through the entire boom bust cycle," rather than selling too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>.
*   **Imposter Syndrome:** Feeling like an imposter is a common and even healthy sign of self-reflection, especially when navigating high-stakes environments like crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. The way to deal with it is to "do it anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. Investors, despite feeling imposter syndrome, gain "magic powers" to influence founders due to their external perspective and capital commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.
*   **Crypto's Inevitable, Subversive Nature:** Hasu views crypto as "inevitable," similar to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. It is intrinsically "subversive" because it changes the balance of power between individuals and governments by offering uncensorable, unstoppable, programmable money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. Unlike most technologies that strengthen the state, crypto is designed "for people and not for States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:19">[01:59:19]</a>.

By combining technical knowledge, public engagement, strong intuition for people, continuous unstructured learning, a focus on adding unique value, and a realistic perspective on wealth and influence, individuals can navigate the volatile yet rewarding world of [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets|crypto investment strategies]].

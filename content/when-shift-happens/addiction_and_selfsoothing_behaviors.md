Addiction is often linked to a fundamental lack of connection and a perceived gap between the connection an individual desires and what they are actually receiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This phenomenon can affect anyone, regardless of their social or financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Roots of Addiction: Loneliness and Suppression

A primary cause of addiction is identified as a lack of connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. When individuals suppress their emotions, they are more likely to develop various forms of addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This suppression can stem from early [[impact of childhood experiences on adult relationships | childhood experiences]], where the relationship with a primary caregiver defines a child's perception of interactions with other humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. If a child's needs are not consistently met, they can become "wired for a narrative that other humans are not wholly to be trusted or not wholly to be relied upon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

### Self-Soothing Behaviors
To cope with unmet emotional needs or to avoid negative emotions, individuals may resort to [[personal healing and selfawareness | self-soothing]] behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. These actions serve as distractions rather than genuine solutions to underlying issues.
Examples of self-soothing behaviors include:
*   Shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>
*   Sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>
*   Food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>
*   Alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>
*   Drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>

These behaviors are "all used as distractions from healing the self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a> and often occur when individuals lack consciousness or awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.

## Personal Experiences with Self-Sabotage and Addiction

Simone Hang, a human connection specialist, shares her [[personal growth and recovery experiences | personal experiences]] with how her upbringing influenced her adult relationships and coping mechanisms.

### The "Roller Coaster" Dynamic
Growing up with a parent who was both loving and critical created a "roller coaster" emotional environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. This unpredictable dynamic felt "safe and normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>, leading her to get bored with secure and stable relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. This wiring for excitement and dopamine meant she would often leave "super amazing" partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>, engaging in what she describes as self-sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. She acknowledges that this pattern is "bad for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a> but feels normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

### Running from Emotions
In her early twenties, after her father's death and a period of parental estrangement, Simone sought comfort in partying, drinking, and searching for love in unhealthy places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. She realized later that she was "not realizing without that [[personal healing and selfawareness | self-awareness]] that self-connection that what I was looking for was to be held" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. Her therapist eventually identified her as a "love addict," constantly seeking validation from others due to a childhood sense of unlovability, which paradoxically repelled genuine connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

## Healing and Awareness
The key to overcoming these patterns is through [[personal healing and selfawareness | healing emotional history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>. It involves:
*   **Processing emotions:** Instead of suppressing feelings, it's crucial to allow them to pass through, even if it's painful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.
*   **Seeking support:** Professional help, such as therapy, is highly recommended for holding a safe space to express grief and trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. Trusted friends who can listen without judgment are also invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>.
*   **Consciousness:** Simone's second book emphasizes the importance of "being aware and finding that Consciousness because it all starts there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>.

> "Our definition of what an addict used to be is like totally different now, we've all got something that we are not using in the right measure, that we are dependent on and we know about it, it's so accessible to us." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>

This broader understanding highlights that many people struggle with dependencies, underscoring the need for greater [[personal healing and selfawareness | self-awareness]] and conscious choices to foster genuine connection and well-being.

The landscape of investing is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from traditional, centralized models towards more community-driven and meritocratic approaches. This shift is characterized by a re-evaluation of value, emphasizing "social capital" and direct community involvement over exclusive venture capital (VC) funding. Alex Fauvelle, Chief Partnership Officer at SwissBorg, highlights key dimensions shaping [[the_future_of_the_crypto_market | future investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>.

## Reimagining Investment: Beyond Traditional VC Capital

Fauvelle believes that VC capital, as it currently operates, will eventually become "irrelevant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>. The traditional model concentrates wealth and power among a small percentage of the world's population, as money flows through middlemen to grow wealth for a select few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. He argues that wealth created through investments should instead flow back to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>.

Instead of projects having numerous VC logos that offer little in terms of users, the focus should shift to fostering strong community involvement. The "best investor in the world is an investor that is also your user" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>. Users are often more "naive" or emotionally invested, making them less likely to "dump" their holdings compared to VCs whose primary goal is to buy and sell for profit within strict timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>. This creates a "win-win-win" scenario where businesses gain funding, users, and dedicated support, while users gain access to investments they might otherwise miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

## The Rise of Social Capital

In this evolving investment landscape, **social capital** and an "invisible form of currency" are becoming paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a>. This "invisible currency" refers to the value an individual brings to society, unrelated to monetary wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.

As [[the_role_of_blockchain_in_future_wealth_creation | financial literacy]] and [[future_of_digital_ownership_and_capitalism | financial intelligence]] grow, individuals are taking back control of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. This shift empowers individuals to contribute value beyond just money, especially for those without substantial wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>.

> "If you don't have a lot of money how can you bring value to a project and for example growing your own community whether it's twitch YouTube doesn't matter right whether it's a private telegram group chat you can create that community all of a sudden you will be able to prove to these projects that Hey listen I'll bring you more value than than most of the VCS that you have there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>

## The Power of Influence and Relatability

Content creators, such as YouTubers and podcasters, are increasingly replacing traditional financial advisors like Warren Buffett or experts seen on CNBC and Bloomberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. New generations look to their favorite influencers as trusted sources of financial advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>.

This phenomenon is driven by relatability; people feel closer to influencers than to established financial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:59">[01:30:59]</a>. This influence can be leveraged, as followers are more likely to support projects backed by or associated with their trusted influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:25">[01:31:25]</a>. This creates a new way of investing rooted in community and shared belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:33">[01:31:33]</a>.

## Democratizing Investment: SwissBorg Alpha and Social Tokens

Platforms like SwissBorg Alpha exemplify this future by allowing everyone to invest, not just those with significant capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>. However, simply voting with money is no longer sufficient; contributing other forms of value, particularly social capital and influence, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.

The concept of "social tokens" further illustrates this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. Imagine an artist like Justin Bieber creating his own tokens early in his career, allowing fans to "donate" and receive tokens in return, based on their belief in his future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>. Future album sales or revenue share programs could then distribute earnings back to these early supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a>. This direct, socially driven investment model represents a significant aspect of [[the_future_of_digital_ownership_and_capitalism | the future of digital ownership and capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:12">[01:34:12]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to shift from a system where VC money acts as "exit liquidity" for the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:20">[01:29:20]</a>, to a more "meritocratic model" where "smarter money" comes from a democratized and community-driven investment landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a>. This vision is deeply tied to the broader implications of [[the_role_of_nfts_and_blockchain_in_future_investments | NFTs and blockchain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a>.

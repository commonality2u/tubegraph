Nicola Youngli, a two-time Europe champion and one-time world champion in bodybuilding, exemplifies the profound impact of discipline and sacrifice on achieving one's dreams. His journey from a small Swiss town to the "Bali paradise" is a testament to unwavering dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Overcoming Adversity and Financial Challenges

Youngli's path to success was not without significant obstacles. At 19, he started his life as a student with a substantial debt of $20,000, incurred after a severe car crash in France where his insurance didn't fully cover the costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This debt continually increased, creating a tough financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Rather than letting this "kill" his future, he chose to use it as fuel to [[Personal growth through adversity | become better]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

He worked every month as a student to pay as much as he could, and once he finished his studies and secured his first job, all his income went towards paying off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. It took him around four years to completely close the debt, living in a negative bank account balance and eating cheap food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This experience instilled in him the resolve to work tirelessly towards his [[The pursuit of success and its impact on happiness | big dreams and ambitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## The Bodybuilding Journey: A Fight Against Oneself

Youngli began training in martial arts at 13 and later transitioned into serious bodybuilding at 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Initially, he wasn't passionate about bodybuilding, even finding it "stupid" to see big guys flexing on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. His shift to bodybuilding came after he had to stop heavy sparring in martial arts due to his job, which couldn't accommodate bruises on his face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

He found appeal in the "healthy space" that training created, forcing him to eat healthier and see progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The turning point was observing a friend's bodybuilding competition, where he witnessed the entire process: nutrition, training, cardio, mindset, and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This exposed him to the challenging and personal work involved, a fight against oneself every single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. He understood that bodybuilding competition isn't about fighting others, but about showing the culmination of months of internal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurial Grind: Two Full-Time Jobs

For years, Youngli effectively worked two full-time jobs: a microtechnic engineer and a budding professional bodybuilder/influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. His daily routine was relentless, a clear example of [[Addictive personalities and discipline in entrepreneurial success | extreme discipline]]:
*   **5 AM**: Wake up for cardio on his bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **7 AM - 5 PM**: Work at his engineering job in a clean room laboratory, where phone use was impossible due to safety and camera monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Evenings**: Drive home, change, go to the gym for hard training, and then cook all five meals for the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Weekends**: Training, resting, and focusing on posing practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

This intense schedule left him with "no life," consisting only of cardio, job, training, cooking, and sleep for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. He only quit his engineering job when his side income as an influencer surpassed his main salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

### Obsession as a Catalyst for Success
Youngli emphasizes that this level of commitment requires obsession. He was constantly thinking about content, exploring new ideas, and taking notes even during his cardio sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. This relentless focus, while potentially toxic as it prevents disconnection, is, according to him, essential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This aligns with [[The role of selfdevelopment and mindset in achieving goals | the mindset that drives achievement]].

## The Volatility of Influence and the Need for Diversification

The influencer industry, while seemingly glamorous, is unstable and stressful due to intense competition and reliance on ever-changing algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. Brands pay based on engagement and statistics, meaning a decrease in numbers can be anxiety-inducing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this instability dramatically. In April 2020, as the world locked down, Youngli lost one major deal and three others had their salaries frozen, leaving him with no income from social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This period, though lasting only three months for him, underscored the importance of not depending solely on social media income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>. He advises influencers to be smart with their earnings, [[Financial and Personal Growth Overcoming Challenges and Learning from Mistakes | invest on the side]], and diversify their income streams for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.

Even after achieving success, the work never truly stops. Youngli maintains a demanding schedule, waking up at 5 AM, having meetings, training, and working for 14 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. However, he emphasizes that because he chose this life and is passionate about what he does, it doesn't feel like "work" compared to his previous corporate job where he felt like a "slave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. This shift illustrates the difference between pursuing success for external validation versus internal fulfillment, connecting to [[The pursuit of success and its impact on happiness]].

## Personal Well-being and Values

Despite the demanding schedule, Youngli prioritizes his [[Balancing professional success with personal life | mental health]]. He actively works to disconnect, often by planning posts in advance and turning off his phone for a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. He describes the peace of being offline, enjoying the moment without notifications or external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. His main passion, being a professional athlete, reinforces the importance of self-care, as a healthy body and mind are intrinsically linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.

### Relationships and Childhood Trauma
Youngli shared that he sought therapy to address a toxic attachment to relationships, stemming from his parents' breakup when he was two years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>. This childhood experience led to anxiety, possessiveness, and a feeling that his happiness depended on having a woman in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>. Through therapy, he worked on self-confidence and finding happiness alone, understanding that a partner should be an addition to his happiness, not its source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. This journey highlights the importance of [[Navigating relationships and personal values in pursuit of success | self-reflection and healing]] for overall stability.

He also believes that successful individuals often choose stable, long-term relationships because dating and managing multiple romantic entanglements are major distractions that drain time and energy from building one's "empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.

## Nutrition and Training Discipline

Youngli maintains strict nutritional discipline, emphasizing that "diet is everything" in achieving a desired physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>. He prepares his meals in advance or uses meal prep services, dispelling the excuse of not having time by stressing the importance of organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>. When traveling, he actively seeks out healthy options, stating that claiming "no healthy options" is merely an excuse for laziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:26">[01:31:26]</a>.

He emphasizes the often-overlooked aspects of fitness:
*   **Sleep**: Crucial for muscle recovery and growth; muscles are built during sleep, not in the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>.
*   **Mind-to-Muscle Connection**: Actively feeling and flexing muscles during exercise for better sensation and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[01:34:57]</a>.

He also dismisses "bad genetics" as an excuse for not achieving a dream body, arguing that consistent, hard work over many years (17 years of training in his case) can transform one's physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

Youngli's journey underscores several critical principles for achieving success:
*   **Make the Most of Your Life**: Life is one shot; don't waste time on things that don't provide benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:33">[01:42:33]</a>.
*   **Believe in Yourself and Keep Going**: Even when not motivated, discipline must push you to continue. Success comes from repeating the same tasks day after day, year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:53">[01:24:53]</a>. This echoes the theme of [[The importance of persevering and innovation despite setbacks]].
*   **Embrace Delayed Gratification**: Short-term pleasures can derail long-term goals. Choosing a disciplined lifestyle, even if it seems "boring" to others, offers unparalleled freedom and satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.
*   **Focus on Happiness**: Ultimately, the goal is to be happy. Don't force a lifestyle that doesn't bring joy, even if it looks "perfect" to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Compare Yourself to Others**: Everyone experiences ups and downs. Focus on your own path and what makes you proud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>.
*   **Build for the Future**: His biggest motivation is to build a secure future for his potential children, giving them opportunities he didn't have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>. This highlights another facet of [[Navigating relationships and personal values in pursuit of success]].

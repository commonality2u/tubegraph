This article explores the crucial role of cryptocurrency and decentralized networks in the advancement and future of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as discussed by the CEO of IET, a company aiming to build the world's largest AI compute cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The content is based on an interview from the "Drops" podcast series by "When Shift Happens," which showcases rising star projects in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## IET's Vision: The "Airbnb of AI"

IET aims to become the world's largest AI compute cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The CEO prefers IET to be seen as "simply a better, cheaper, faster cloud," rather than focusing solely on its decentralized nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. IET's ambition is to compete directly with major cloud providers like CoreWeave, AWS, and GCP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The analogy of IET as the "Airbnb of AI" highlights its approach: just as Airbnb aggregates underutilized hotels, IET aggregates underutilized compute resources from around the world into a single platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. This includes thousands of independent data centers operating at low capacity (12-18%) and millions of consumer devices (laptops, PCs, gaming rigs) with underused GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

## The AI Compute Shortage

A significant challenge in [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development | AI development]] is the severe shortage of compute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. Traditional cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cannot keep up with the demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. AI is "absolutely ravenous," consuming massive amounts of processing power, with machine and deep learning application requirements doubling every 3.4 months (a 10x growth every 18 months and 100x every three years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Building new data centers is slow and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.

### The Rise of GPUs

GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) are specialized computers originally designed for graphical tasks like video games and movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. However, they were discovered to be exceptionally effective for both creating and running AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. This has led to a high demand for GPUs, making them "the most valuable asset in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

The speaker draws a parallel between GPUs and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>:
> "Oil mankind has known about oil for centuries, millennia even, but for most of our history it was a nuisance... but then at some point people figured out hey this has some uses... but when the automobile in particular the internal combustion engine was invented there became a real use for oil... and then that's what made oil the most valuable resource in the world... I think we're on the same path for GPUs... now that AI is out and they are needed for AI because they're really the lifeblood of AI they're now becoming the most valuable asset in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>

## Why AI Needs Crypto (Decentralized Networks)

The CEO of IET firmly believes that [[the_evolution_and_future_of_crypto_and_ai_integration | AI needs crypto]] (specifically, decentralized networks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. There are two primary reasons:

1.  **Solving the Compute Shortage:** Decentralized networks offer the best way to address the current shortage of AI compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. By aggregating underutilized resources, they provide "access to unlimited computing power, almost infinite scalability, censorship resistance, better performance and best of all much much lower costs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. Decentralized networks like IET are up to 10 times cheaper than centralized ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. This cheap, fast, and better solution disrupts a multi-trillion dollar market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

2.  **Orchestrating AI Agents on a Massive Scale:** Looking towards the [[future_of_ai_and_its_intersection_with_crypto | future of AI]], researchers estimate there will be hundreds of billions to trillions of AI devices â€“ about 150 times larger than the entire global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. These [[the_intersection_of_crypto_and_ai_agents | AI agents]] could exist on networks of billions of GPUs, potentially powered by consumer devices, mobile devices, or even smart cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
    > "When you look at this world of trillions of AI agents living on billions of nodes and oh by the way they need to be permissionless I don't see how you could orchestrate this without a decentralized network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>

### Competing with Centralized Giants

The biggest [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development | challenge for decentralized networks]] is competing against established players like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. These incumbents offer a complete suite of services (compute, storage, data, networking) on a single, convenient platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. The solution for decentralized networks is to replicate this offering, but at a "much much lower cost" (e.g., one-tenth the cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

The speaker refers to the "Innovator's Dilemma," arguing that incumbent big tech firms "literally cannot compete with a disruptor" like decentralized networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. To compete, they would have to rebuild their entire business model, destroying their current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
> "It's the same thing with crypto, the incumbent Tech firms cannot build a decentralized network without destroying their own business model so it's literally just a matter of time until they lose and the cool thing about crypto it's the only major technology that's disruptive AI VR it's not those companies can easily be acquired by Google Facebook but they they there's literally no defense against decentralization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>

This highlights how [[decentralized_ai_and_democratization_through_crypto | decentralized AI and democratization through crypto]] presents a unique disruptive force in the tech landscape, unlike other innovations that can simply be acquired by large corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

## Crypto and AI as Tools

The CEO emphasizes that neither crypto nor AI are industries themselves; they are merely "tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. Just as electricity became a fundamental component of every company, AI is rapidly becoming a fundamental component of every company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. For IET, crypto is simply "a way that we organize our network" in a decentralized fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

When considering building a protocol, the advice given is not to start with the protocol, but with a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. If a problem exists and crypto happens to be the best solution for it, then a protocol makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

## Conclusion: Decentralization is the Only Solution for AI

The CEO concludes that decentralized networks are not just the best solution for AI, but "the only solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>. The compute shortage for AI, coupled with its use in other areas like rendering and the metaverse, means demand for GPUs will always outstrip supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Furthermore, a future world with trillions of AI agents operating on billions of permissionless devices demands a decentralized approach that centralized entities cannot provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

In the dynamic and often tumultuous world of crypto and beyond, the ability to persevere and innovate in the face of adversity is paramount. Mt Mumtaz, co-founder and CEO of Helius, embodies this philosophy, driven by a deep-seated commitment to progress and a contrarian mindset.

## Mission and Vision: Accelerating World Computing

Mt views Solana as a "world computer where anyone can just build products and then they're judged by the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His current mission is to "accelerate this thing to something the world has never seen before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Helius, an infrastructure company in the Solana ecosystem, acts as a "Home Depot for internet apps," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> making it easier for developers to bring ideas to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

This commitment stemmed from a fundamental annoyance at the "lack of applications in crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. By providing essential tools, Helius aims to shorten the time between an idea and its product realization, thereby increasing the chance of useful applications emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Grand Mission
> Mt's broader mission is rooted in a belief in "magic" and the discovery of new things, hindered by "arbitrary walled gardens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a> and unnecessary regulation that slows progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. He advocates for a capitalist society focused on "acceleration," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:08">[02:00:08]</a> where humans coordinate better and have better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>.

## Fueling the Fire: Personal Adversity and Mindset

Mt's relentless drive comes from two primary sources:

1.  **Memento Mori:** A constant awareness of life's brevity. He reflects on "the shortness of life," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a> noting early deaths in his family, including his mother's passing when he was young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This instilled a strong sense of urgency to "really try to do something while you're here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:15">[02:53:15]</a>
    *   This deep [[personal_growth_through_adversity | personal growth through adversity]] taught him that "the sun still comes up the next day," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> and "the world doesn't care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:57">[02:58:57]</a> about personal misfortunes. This realization fostered a choice: either lament or "move forward." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:22">[02:59:22]</a>
    *   His mother's death also revealed the arbitrary nature of many societal norms, leading him to question things like celebrating holidays purely out of tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
    *   Growing up with hardships—language barriers, poverty, bed bugs—he developed a "so what" attitude, realizing that if he could overcome those, he "can kind of just do anything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:05">[03:13:05]</a> This developed into early stoic philosophy, which he later recognized in formal texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

2.  **Divine Discontent:** An inherent tendency to get "annoyed and angry very easily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> by inefficiencies and "incorrect things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. This manifests as a desire to fix problems immediately, especially in areas of his expertise like software development and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>.
    *   He does not optimize for happiness, but rather for "pursuing meaning," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">[02:55:04]</a> focusing on whether "the job getting finished or or are we making progress here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:58">[02:57:58]</a> This reflects a strong [[importance_of_discipline_and_sacrifice_in_achieving_success | importance of discipline and sacrifice in achieving success]].

## The FTX Collapse: A Catalyst for Leadership

The collapse of FTX in late 2022 was a "disastrous end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> for crypto, yet Mt saw it as a huge opportunity for Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. While others believed Solana was dead, he recognized that FTX's influence had become predatory and that its removal would allow the ecosystem to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "I think they were like helpful in like 2020 like during the super early days but by 2022 they really weren't doing anything... and so I actually my first instinct was like oh this is awesome." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>

Despite bearish sentiment from the crypto community (CT), Mt observed that Solana's developers were still building and solutions were being proposed for existing outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. This period showcased his [[resilience_in_business_and_its_importance_in_the_crypto_market | resilience in business and its importance in the crypto market]] and his [[importance_of_integrity_and_contrarian_thinking_for_founders_and_investors | importance of integrity and contrarian thinking for founders and investors]]. He actively combated misinformation, becoming the "reply guy" who corrected false claims about Solana with facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

## The Power of Doing and Debating

Mt emphasizes the crucial distinction between "talking" and "doing." He quotes Carl Jung: "You are what you do, not what you say you'll do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a> Talking is easier, offers a dopamine release, and can create a false sense of accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. True progress comes from action.

> [!QUOTE] "The only way progress is made and errors are corrected and knowledge is created is through discourse." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>

Being a "reply guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a> in crypto is vital because it fosters discourse, allowing ideas to battle it out and leading to the "reduction of errors" and approximation of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>. Even if minds aren't changed directly, the public can see both sides of an argument and decide for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. This approach of continuous improvement through criticism is fundamental to the creation of knowledge, akin to the scientific method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

## Overcoming Obstacles: Mindset is Key

Mt believes that what prevents people from starting a company, losing weight, or achieving goals is simply "mindset." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a> There are always excuses, but the only way forward is to "be an Unstoppable force that can overcome excuses." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>

> [!QUOTE] "You just need to believe that you can do something... it doesn't matter how unrealistic it is, realism is stupid." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>

He highlights that "everything you see around you that you call life was like made up by people 100% that are no smarter than you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a> This perspective empowers individuals with a sense of agency, emphasizing that if they can just "do something" and produce an output, they have already achieved a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This highlights the [[entrepreneurial_persistence_and_success_in_crypto | entrepreneurial persistence and success in crypto]].

## Continued Vigilance: The Job is Not Finished

Despite Solana's rebound, Mt remains "paranoid," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a> constantly pushing for more acceleration. He believes that "acceleration is not about going fast and then staying at that pace," but rather "the rate of change in velocity," meaning the need to "keep being faster and faster and faster." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a> This relentless drive for progress reflects his view that "the job not finished." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>

This commitment to continuous improvement and innovation, fueled by personal experiences and a defiant mindset, defines the [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_overcoming_industry_challenges | entrepreneurial journey and overcoming industry challenges]] and drives Mt's pursuit of a world where potential is unlocked through decentralized "world computing."

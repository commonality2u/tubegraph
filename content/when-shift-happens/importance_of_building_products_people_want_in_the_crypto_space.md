From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

The crypto industry's focus must shift from economic incentives and tokens to **building products people want** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. Jesse Pollak, creator of Base, emphasizes that despite the complex "Game Theory" and tokens within crypto, the fundamental goal remains to create something users desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This means prioritizing user experience, utility, and real-world applicability.

## The Mission of Base

Base's mission is to [[building_cryptocurrency_platforms_focused_on_user_needs|build a global onchain economy]] that fosters innovation, creativity, and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This involves upgrading economic systems that are decades or even centuries old and are currently failing users due to high costs, slowness, frustration, and discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The aim is to create a new system where:
*   Entrepreneurs can build new businesses on an open platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   Creators can earn from their content, moving away from centralized platforms that offer minimal returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   Anyone, regardless of location or device, has equal access to tools for business and [[building_wealth_in_crypto|wealth creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Critiques and Focus for Crypto Builders

Pollak outlines three key areas for crypto builders to focus on:
1.  **Build things people want:** Avoid getting lost in economic incentives and tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. As in traditional startups, the core principle from accelerators like Y Combinator is to "build something people want; talk to customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.
2.  **Make it easy to use:** Products in the new global onchain economy must be "better than every online product that exists today" to encourage adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. The combination of smart wallets, Base names, and L2s provides the infrastructure for powerful consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.
3.  **Onboard new people:** Engage in "missionary work" to educate and bring new users on-chain. This hands-on approach helps builders understand user needs and usability challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

### The Problem with Token-First Approaches

A significant challenge in the crypto space is the tendency to prioritize the token over the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. Pollak points out that projects like PolyMarket, Farcaster, and Pump.fun have achieved growth without launching a token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. He argues that rushing to launch a token before achieving product-market fit can be "incredibly toxic" and detrimental to creating great products, akin to an early-stage startup going public too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. The focus should be on years of "hard work to make this product great," rather than being distracted by the perceived "free money" of tokens, which often comes with the cost of distraction and dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>.

This perspective is central to [[the_importance_of_product_as_marketing_in_cryptocurrency|the importance of product as marketing in cryptocurrency]], where the utility and user experience of the product itself drive adoption and growth.

## Real-World Benefits of Crypto

To communicate crypto's value proposition, it's essential to explain how it benefits humanity and everyday individuals:

### Crypto's Benefit to Humanity
Crypto provides an opportunity to build a new generation of the internet that upgrades inefficient, expensive, and slow legacy systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. This transformation can:
*   Give everyday people access to best-in-class financial services globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.
*   Allow creators to own and derive value from their creativity on open platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   Offer small businesses and entrepreneurs tools to build generational businesses that are 10x cheaper, faster, and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>.

### How Everyday People Can Benefit
Examples of tangible benefits include:
*   **Art and Creativity:** Platforms like Zora or Rodeo allow direct support for creators through micro-payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.
*   **Dining Experiences:** Apps like Blackbird, used in New York restaurants, enable better dining experiences, lower fees for restaurants, and crypto payment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **Global Payments:** Crypto offers instant, free global payment rails, significantly reducing the cost and time of remittances compared to traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. For example, a $45 average remittance cost from Mexico to the U.S. can be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

### How to Use Crypto
To get started, users can:
*   Create a wallet quickly via platforms like wallet.coinbase.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.
*   Use the wallet to send money globally, mint creativity, or pay at participating businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>.
*   Small businesses can accept USDC for free, potentially doubling their profit margins by eliminating typical 3% payment processing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

## Maintaining a Builder Mindset

In an industry prone to emotional roller coasters tied to price fluctuations, maintaining a "builder mindset" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>. This means:
*   **Focusing on what can be controlled:** Directing energy towards making an impact within one's sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.
*   **Making consistent progress:** Even small, incremental improvements to products contribute to long-term optimism and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>.
*   **Avoiding distractions:** Tuning out price volatility and market noise to focus on building products that make a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

This approach aligns with the broader principles of [[building_and_adapting_crypto_products_amid_market_changes|building and adapting crypto products amid market changes]] and [[the_importance_of_community_and_longterm_thinking_in_the_crypto_industry|long-term thinking]]. The industry is entering a new era of crypto that will be more "rational and principled," rewarding those who prioritize rigorous product development over short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Ultimately, the success of crypto will depend on its ability to offer experiences that are 10x better than existing alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:25">[01:26:25]</a>, leading to a viral adoption cycle for onchain applications.

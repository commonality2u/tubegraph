The advent of quantum computing presents a significant and imminent threat to existing cryptographic systems, fundamentally altering the landscape of digital security and trust. This challenge necessitates a shift towards new cryptographic paradigms, such as postquantum cryptography, to secure data and infrastructure against future attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.

## The Threat of Quantum Computing
Quantum computing is a subatomic technology that has reached a stage where functional quantum chips exist, though they are not yet capable of general computing tasks like running applications or games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. However, these machines are exceptionally proficient at performing complex mathematical calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. This capability poses a direct threat to the world's current cryptographic infrastructure, which is primarily built on [[challenges_and_assumptions_in_crypto_protocols | elliptic curve cryptography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.

Currently, breaking a cryptographic key secured by elliptic curve cryptography would require the combined computing power of all classical computers on Earth for an estimated billion years, making it practically unfeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. However, quantum computers are mathematically capable of overcoming this barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. Experts predict that quantum computers powerful enough to break current encryption could emerge within the next 5 to 7 years, with progress accelerating each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

The profound [[impact_of_crypto_on_physical_infrastructure_and_technology | impact of this vulnerability]] includes:
*   **Data Harvesting**: Data encrypted with current methods can be harvested now and stored, to be decrypted later when quantum computing capabilities mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>. This means any secret—from nuclear codes to personal Bitcoin holdings—protected by quantum-vulnerable cryptography is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Imbalance**: The ability to access all global secrets simultaneously would create the largest geopolitical imbalance in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   **Blockchain Vulnerability**: Blockchains, including their underlying infrastructure and transactions, are not immune to these quantum threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. For example, a quantum computer could potentially manipulate public transaction hashes to enable double-spending or alter transaction details if the transaction has already been approved by a vulnerable signing mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. This is considered one of the weakest points of current blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

## The Solution: Postquantum Cryptography
[[importance_of_postquantum_cryptography | Postquantum cryptography]], also known as quantum-safe cryptography, involves a different mathematical approach that has been designed to resist threats from quantum chips and traditional attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

### Naris Protocol's Approach
Naris Protocol aims to be the first postquantum blockchain in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>. It leverages resilient mathematical principles to create a universal trust system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

Naris Protocol addresses the problem by:
*   **Decentralizing Trust Infrastructure**: The protocol focuses on decentralizing the pure infrastructure layer, known as the "sub-zero layer," which is currently a centralized point of failure for many digital systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Validator Integrity**: It allows validators in a blockchain network to cryptographically prove their trustworthiness to each other, preventing compromised systems from participating in the consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
*   **Postquantum Transactions**: Beyond infrastructure, Naris Protocol also applies postquantum measures to transactions themselves, mitigating risks like hash-based attacks and double-spending by quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.
*   **Transversal Impact**: The technology is designed to have a broad impact across industries, including telecommunications, software development, robotics, and car manufacturing, where digital security is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.

Naris Protocol has raised $36 million, with a significant portion allocated to research and development to solve these fundamental problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.

### Global Response and Awareness
There is growing awareness of the quantum threat at governmental and institutional levels:
*   The IEEE Foundation has collaborated on a white paper regarding postquantum and blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>.
*   Countries like the US, China, and members of the European Union are heavily investing in quantum technologies and have strategic plans for quantum-safe transitions by 2030-2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.
*   The US has enacted laws requiring all entities dealing with the government to be postquantum compliant before 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   China's expenditure on quantum technologies in recent years has exceeded its investment in nuclear arsenal, highlighting its strategic importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. The combined expenditure of the European Union and the US in this realm matches China's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>.
*   Major tech companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Google envision "Web 4" as a quantum-driven internet with [[redefining_crypto_for_wider_adoption | trust by design]] and [[ai_integration_in_crypto_and_potential_impacts_on_market_dynamics | AI by design]], emphasizing the need to change fundamental paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.

The shift towards postquantum cryptography is crucial to ensure that all digital systems, from financial transactions to smart cars, can maintain integrity, resilience, and security in the face of evolving threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>. This involves understanding that true trust goes beyond mere security; it requires verifiable integrity of digital systems and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a>.

Irene Xiao, a prominent figure in the crypto industry, shares her insights on the unique challenges and opportunities faced by women entrepreneurs, particularly concerning the intersection of appearance and business acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Perception of "Pretty Privilege"
The stereotype that female influencers earn money merely for being "pretty" is acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Irene points out that maintaining an attractive appearance requires significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The key lies in leveraging this "asset" strategically and innovatively, as audiences quickly become bored with repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. According to Irene, if one can extract the best value from this asset, they are demonstrating intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The perception of a woman's capabilities can shift dramatically with success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. Initially, people might dismiss a woman's achievements as solely due to her looks, but as her business grows and succeeds, this perception changes to acknowledging her intelligence and capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. Success can help justify past actions and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

## Navigating Relationships in Business
Being perceived as "pretty" can make it easier to initiate contact and [[building_and_scaling_a_successful_business | approach people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. However, transforming a superficial connection into a substantial business relationship requires strong communication skills and the ability to offer value beyond appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. When dealing with influential men who might stereotype "pretty women," Irene emphasizes that the ultimate goal is to achieve desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. As long as one gets what they want and the relationship can continue to provide resources for growth, how others perceive them becomes less important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

## Developing Mental Toughness and Business Acumen
The [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | reality of entrepreneurship]] involves significant mental strain, despite the perceived freedom from a traditional 9-to-5 job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Having money can attract negative attention and create more problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.

Irene learned the hard way about money management in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. A key lesson is to keep the team lean at the start and avoid expanding too quickly, even when significant funds have been raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. The focus should be on making the best use of existing resources to ensure longevity, rather than rapid expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This mindset allows a company to survive for years without immediate profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. While rapid development can be necessary in a bull market to capture hype, entrepreneurs must discern the exact right time to spend and expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. This involves managing FOMO (fear of missing out) and making informed decisions about catching trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

Building a business is difficult, but it fosters significant [[personal_reflections_on_entrepreneurship_and_mindset | personal growth]] and mental resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. Irene shares a [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | personal experience]] where she cried after being falsely accused of stealing a photo and being called a "man" by a prominent figure in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. This experience led to an older, successful entrepreneur telling her she was "mentally weak" and not ready for entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. Over two years, she developed a high tolerance for stress and criticism, reaching a point where external opinions no longer affect her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

The ability to grow and develop depends on not taking criticism personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. As an entrepreneur, it's crucial to disregard mental exhaustion from constant criticism and external voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. Ego has no place in business, as customers, investors, and others generally do not care about an entrepreneur's personal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Success and Risk-Taking
It is uncommon for an entrepreneur to achieve massive success in their very first venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. Most highly successful individuals have built multiple companies and experienced previous failures before achieving significant breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. Failure should be normalized in the entrepreneurial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

Entrepreneurship is not about having a perfect idea and flawless execution from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Instead, it involves trying something that makes sense, persistently pivoting, changing, or adapting when it doesn't resonate with a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. This continuous adaptation means that true failure is avoided as long as one doesn't give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. Success often takes a decade of consistent effort, sacrifice, and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

While Irene considers her first venture successful, she notes that early success can sometimes hinder the ability to sustain or replicate it long-term, especially due to a lack of experience in capitalizing on opportunities quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.

A successful entrepreneur's mentality tends to shift over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. As they become more publicly known and successful, they may become more risk-averse due to the fear of public failure and the associated shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. This can lead to a significant ego problem, where the desire to avoid public failure outweighs the appetite for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Given the immense mental strength required, many successful entrepreneurs transition to roles like venture capitalists or advisors, finding it safer and preferring to empower younger generations to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

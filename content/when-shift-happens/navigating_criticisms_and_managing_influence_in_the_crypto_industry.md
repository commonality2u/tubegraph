Raoul Pal, co-founder and CEO of Real Vision, a financial knowledge and education platform, is a significant figure in the macroeconomics and crypto space with millions of followers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. His insights touch upon the challenges of managing public perception and the inherent risks of a highly volatile market.

## The Responsibility of Influence

Pal views his mission as helping others take advantage of life's opportunities, particularly the financial journey that the crypto world presents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. He aims to "bring as many people along as possible in that journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The impact of his work is evident when people stop him in the street to express gratitude, with one individual sharing that he was retiring thanks to Pal's guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Despite his influence, Pal explicitly states he does not claim to be prophetic or a "guru," acknowledging his fallibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>. He sees himself as a "journeyman," learning alongside his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Building a Personal Brand

Pal's focus on personal branding was not initially a choice, but a realization that his identity served as the "top of funnel" for Real Vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:46">[01:37:46]</a>. He started his YouTube channel, "Raoul Pal The Journeyman," at the suggestion of a Silicon Valley expert, recognizing that people want to find him directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>.

In today's landscape, every company is a media company, and attention is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:10">[01:40:10]</a>. YouTube, in particular, is highlighted as the largest attention capture platform, offering long-form content that persists over time, unlike fleeting social media posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:31">[01:40:31]</a>.

## Navigating [[navigating_fud_and_criticism_in_the_crypto_space | FUD and Criticism]]

One of the significant challenges of managing influence in the crypto space is dealing with [[navigating_fud_and_criticism_in_the_crypto_space | FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a>.

### Experiences with Negative Public Reaction
Pal experienced significant "hatred" when he sold out of Bitcoin in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>. During the 2022-2023 bear market, he faced "awful" attacks from some individuals, particularly those from the macro world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:19">[01:31:19]</a>. He describes this as a "terrible journey" where people are "all wrecked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>.

### Coping with Public Scrutiny
Pal's strategy for dealing with criticism is to "absorb it and try and distance myself from it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>. He refuses to engage in online fights, as it provides the critics with the attention they seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:45">[01:31:45]</a>.

For personal well-being, he employs several strategies:
*   **Acknowledge irrationality:** Recognizing that one's "most irrational self is the 3:00 in the morning self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>.
*   **Write it down:** Getting "crazy thoughts" out of his head by writing them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>.
*   **Routine and Nature:** Returning to a routine, including daily yoga and walking in nature (especially barefoot on a beach), helps him distance himself from the "electronic noise" of online negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>.
*   **Social Interaction:** Meeting people in person helps validate the positive impact of his work, reminding him that he's not "the worst person in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.
*   **Herbal Remedies:** Using Ashwagandha for sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>.

## Preventing "F\*\*\* Ups" and Managing Risk

Pal uses the meme "Don't F\*\*\* This Up" (DFTU) as a clear, simple message to his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This message is encapsulated in an NFT that, when viewed in a Solana wallet, plays a video of him saying the phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:38">[01:44:38]</a>.

The core principles of DFTU include:
*   **No Leverage:** Avoid using leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>.
*   **Self-Custody:** Keep assets in self-custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:55">[01:44:55]</a>.
*   **Focus on Major Tokens:** Keep most assets in major tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:59">[01:44:59]</a>.
*   **Avoid FOMO:** Don't FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) into everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>.

Pal stresses that while speculation has risen due to wage deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a> and the need for people to "take risk" to get ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:39">[02:35:39]</a>, betting on "random meme coins is not the best way to capture that trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:16">[01:45:16]</a>. He advises against chasing high yields or using leverage, as these have historically led to catastrophic losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. He highlights historical examples of blowups, such as Barings Bank and Long-Term Capital Management, as cautionary tales against excessive leverage and yield-seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.

## Challenges and Risks in the Crypto Industry

Pal acknowledges that the [[challenges_in_the_crypto_industry | crypto industry]] is prone to cycles and blowups, particularly due to leverage built on volatile assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>. He warns against "super cycle thesis" as toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.

He points to specific risks in the current cycle:
*   **Re-staking Yields:** He worries about the origin of high re-staking yields (e.g., Uthena, Ethena) and the potential for a single large borrower to cause a systemic failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
*   **Lido:** Although generally considered safe, Lido holds 20% of all ETH, making it a point of paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.
*   **Deribit:** Despite being run by "good people," Deribit handles 90% of the crypto options market. Its high concentration poses a risk if an insurance fund fails or a major blowup occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>.

### The Problem of Dopamine and Human Behavior
Pal observes that people are "addicted to dopamine" and often get bored with simple, effective strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>. Influencers often "say anything that is required to get your attention," leading individuals to take unnecessary risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. This drive leads people to lose money by trying to "out-trade" the market or chase "100x" returns on meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

The allure of quick wealth can lead individuals to "lose their minds," use leverage, and engage in risky yield farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. This ultimately leads to people getting "wrecked" and leaving the space, missing out on the long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

## Outlook and Lessons Learned

Pal advises that the key to success is to stay in the game and avoid losing chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:15">[01:26:15]</a>. He realized that simply holding his original bet and adding during bear markets would have yielded far greater returns than actively trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. The "number go up" phenomenon is supported by the system's design, where collateral values must rise to offset excess debt, meaning assets generally cannot go down long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>.

The power of compounding returns in crypto is significant; Bitcoin, despite bear markets, has compounded at 140% per year since 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. Solana, even after a 98.5% drawdown, compounds at 240% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.

Pal's biggest lesson from previous cycles is a deeper understanding of "how powerful this thing was going to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>. The more he learns, the more he realizes how little he knows, emphasizing the ongoing learning process required in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.

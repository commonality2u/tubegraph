Oliver Yonshev is an entrepreneur, speaker, and the Co-founder and CEO of Flight Story, a marketing strategy, content, and media campaign firm founded in 2021 with Steven Bartlett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | entrepreneurial journey]] is marked by transitions from early aspirations in sports and music to leading successful marketing ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

## Early Life and Non-Entrepreneurial Ventures

Oliver's background includes being a "failed Indie rocker" and, even before that, a "failed football player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>. He grew up in Barnsley, a town he describes as having low aspirations, but he always harbored ambitions beyond the local norms, wanting to "take over the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

He pursued a career in music, achieving moderate success and securing a record deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. However, when his music career didn't work out, he returned to university to study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This led him into the media industry, where he worked for a large media owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## Transition to Entrepreneurship

Oliver left his corporate media job to join Social Chain, a startup in Manchester <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Social Chain became an "incredible success story" in marketing and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. His experience at Social Chain provided significant [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_lessons_learned | key learnings]]:
*   **Optimism and Ambition:** He learned that optimism and ambition are precursors to success, driving momentum through both highs and lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Culture:** Investing in an intentional and clearly defined organizational culture is crucial. Culture should provide fulfillment, challenge, a bigger mission, security, and growth for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. It's essential to defend the culture and avoid compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **People:** As companies are fundamentally groups of people, creating an environment where great people can thrive and have the freedom to do so is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

Reflecting on his [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_challenges | entrepreneurial journey]], Oliver believes his biggest mistake was not pursuing entrepreneurship earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. His media career served as a "bridge period" to learn about the world in a safe environment, but he wishes he had "pulled the trigger" sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. His past "failures" in sport and music may have contributed to a shallow ego, making him hesitant to risk another loss, but he ultimately built resilience and never lost his belief and ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Flight Story and Flight Fund

In 2021, Oliver co-founded Flight Story with Steven Bartlett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Initially, the intention was not to be a traditional marketing business, but rather to consult and help organizations build internal marketing teams and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. However, they observed that 60% of their work naturally gravitated towards direct marketing solutions, leading them to accept their fate as a marketing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

Flight Story distinguishes itself through:
*   Higher standards than most marketing agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   Diverse talent from backgrounds like consulting and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   Innovative approaches to team collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   A strong focus on technology and its application to make marketing more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

Oliver believes youth can be an advantage in entrepreneurship, as knowing "too much" (curse of knowledge) or relying solely on past experience can limit innovation and lead to preconceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. He emphasizes that experience doesn't necessarily dictate capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

In addition to Flight Story, Oliver and Steven launched Flight Fund, a $100 million investment vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This fund aims to address the imbalance in the European funding market, where only 3% of funding comes from entrepreneur-backed entities, unlike the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. The fund also leverages Flight Story's visibility into promising companies to support their growth through capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Focus on Web3

A key focus for both Flight Story and Flight Fund is Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Oliver views Web3 as the next iteration of the internet, encompassing three main areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>:
*   **Blockchain technologies:** Including crypto, NFTs, and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Immersive digital experiences:** Such as AR, VR, and the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Real-world application of machine learning and artificial intelligence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Oliver acknowledges that people generally resist change, but sees an opportunity for organizations like Flight Story to help companies navigate technological disruption and turn confusion into opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He personally holds crypto, considering it less than 10% of his portfolio due to his preference for stable investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. He was initially a crypto cynic, struggling to envision governments relinquishing control, but his view changed as regulations began to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## [[personal_reflections_on_entrepreneurship_and_mindset | Personal Reflections on Entrepreneurship and Mindset]]

Oliver admits that his career and what he does are a "big part of my identity," making it hard to detach his work from who he is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. He views ambition as a "curse" because his mind is constantly active, and he feels uncomfortable with too much downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

To maintain balance and happiness, Oliver relies on:
*   **Diversifying sources of fulfillment:** Ensuring he feels successful in other areas of his life, such as sports, health, friendships, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
*   **Physical activity:** Kickboxing, boxing, football, and general fitness serve as a foundation for his well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.
*   **Goal setting:** He believes setting goals and working towards them provides fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
*   **Strong relationships:** Having a great family and good relationships has kept him "sane and happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

Oliver generally feels blessed to be happy most of the time and has not struggled with severe mental health issues like depression, though he experiences low moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

## Advice and Beliefs

Oliver is a strong advocate for [[personal_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_business_challenges | personal branding]], viewing it simply as one's online reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. He found that creating content on LinkedIn to promote Flight Story inadvertently forced him to learn and form new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Putting ideas into the world, despite the fear of judgment, allows for gaining conviction or evolving opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

For efficient personal branding, he recommends:
*   **Lean into natural strengths:** Choose a medium (writing, video, conversation) that feels most comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.
*   **Consistency and discipline:** Set a commitment (e.g., four podcasts a month) and do not compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   **"Just do it":** Overthinking and pursuing perfection are hindrances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

He highlights that consistency and discipline are key ingredients for success in nearly "everything in life," from building a business to personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>.

One of Oliver's favorite quotes is "if you think you can or you think you can't, you're right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>. He believes that 90% of people's problems could be addressed by taking different actions, suggesting that most preventable issues, like health concerns, stem from choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:29:00">[34:29:00]</a>. While acknowledging that making these choices is hard due to human flaws and challenging circumstances, he maintains that the "playbook for fulfillment" is generally known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:00">[35:08:00]</a>.

His ultimate advice for young aspiring entrepreneurs is to "leave" their comfort zone and make themselves uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:00">[32:29:00]</a>. He emphasizes that youth provides the greatest asset: time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>. For anyone, young or not, he advises to "start it" and pursue an entrepreneurial journey, because "regret's a hell of a thing to carry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>. Consistency and discipline, he states, are what separate those who succeed from those who don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:00">[36:28:00]</a>.

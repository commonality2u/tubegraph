Ray Chan is the co-founder and CEO of Nine Gag, described as the biggest [[the_impact_and_evolution_of_memes_on_the_internet | memes]] platform in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. He is also the co-founder of Memeland, an NFT ecosystem that combines meme culture with the power of NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Early Career and Entrepreneurial Spark

Ray Chan initially studied law at university but did not pursue a career as a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. His first job was in the legal and compliance department of a bank for three months, which he found "too boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. He then worked at a financial news TV station (Now PNC) for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>, which also felt like a "very boring job" where he couldn't see himself working for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

His journey into tech began when he joined an internet company as an online community editor for book lovers, inspired by his love for reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. After two months at this company, he realized that if his young boss (28 years old) could start a company, so could he <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. At 24 years old, he teamed up with his younger brother and friends to build products during their free time on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## The Inception of Nine Gag

Nine Gag was one of several product ideas Ray Chan and his team built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The original idea for Nine Gag, which launched in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>, was a simple website for people to upload and share funny photos and videos easily, addressing the cumbersome process of sharing through email chains or instant messengers like MSN Messenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. At the time, they didn't even consider it a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

### The Pivotal Moment

In 2011, Ray Chan's team joined the 500 Startups accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. They were focused on other ideas, such as an app to aggregate photos from events based on location and network, and an online karaoke product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. However, neither of these gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

The turning point came when one of their mentors noticed them frequently looking at "that funny website." When they revealed it was their own site, with 500,000 visitors per month at the time, the mentor questioned why they weren't focusing on it instead of projects with no traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Ray Chan describes that night as the one that "actually made things happen" for Nine Gag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

### Embracing the "Meme Site" Label

Initially, Nine Gag was hesitant to be labeled a "[[the_impact_and_evolution_of_memes_on_the_internet | meme]] site" because the term "meme" was limiting, referring only to image macros with captions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Over time, as memes evolved and the category became more significant, they embraced the label, understanding that people associated Nine Gag with funny content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Ray Chan believes that "you didn't choose the [[the_impact_and_evolution_of_memes_on_the_internet | meme]] life, the [[the_impact_and_evolution_of_memes_on_the_internet | meme]] life chose you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

In 2012, Nine Gag joined Y Combinator, skipping the traditional application process due to their existing relationship with Sam Altman (who was at YC at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. Their Y Combinator batchmates included Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

## Building an "Attention Monster"

Nine Gag's success over 16 years, accumulating a global audience of 200 million people, is attributed to "constant shipping" and focusing on fundamental elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. This includes ensuring the website is always up, new content is shared daily, and users find satisfaction on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. Ray Chan emphasizes that "hustle is a necessary condition" for building companies, and hard work is a prerequisite for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

## Transition to Web3: Memeland

Ray Chan's "aha moment" with crypto happened about three years ago, around 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. He initially found MetaMask difficult to use and didn't understand the value of NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. However, a desire to diversify assets due to socio-political tensions in Hong Kong and the US-China trade war led him to try opening a crypto wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. The speed of crypto transfers, taking seconds or minutes compared to days for traditional wire transfers, impressed him greatly and solidified his belief in the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

He adopted a philosophy of "pay to learn," investing personal money into NFTs and crypto to gain firsthand experience, even if it meant significant losses (spending 2,000-3,000 ETH on NFTs when ETH was $4,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. This "expensive tuition fee" forced him to learn quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.

### Memeland's Vision
[[overview_of_phantom_and_its_transition_to_sonic | Memeland]] is a community company focused on bringing Web3 to the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. Its mission is to make the world "happier and more meaningful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Just as Nine Gag mainstreamed [[the_impact_and_evolution_of_memes_on_the_internet | memes]] by bringing content to people where they already were (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>, Memeland aims to simplify Web3 so that "normies" can understand and try it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. This involves making complex concepts like seed phrases less visible to the end user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.

Memeland operates on a three-step action plan:
1.  **NFTs**: Great for building communities (Memeland has three NFT collections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.
2.  **Tokens**: Effective for distributing value (e.g., Mcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>.
3.  **Products**: Essential for reaching users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.

Memeland has partnered with projects like [[the_rise_and_strategy_of_pudgy_penguins | Pudgy Penguins]], recognizing LucaNet's (Pudgy Penguins CEO) ability to build a business with community and leverage past e-commerce experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. Ray Chan is an investor in and advisor to [[arthur_cheongs_crypto_strategy_and_journey | Tangent]], praising their objective and honest opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. He respects crypto projects that haven't failed and whose founders are still working hard, viewing them as "Sensei" from whom to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

## Philosophical Outlook

Ray Chan embraces a contrarian mindset, believing that what most people do usually leads to ordinary lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>. He dislikes complaining, viewing it as giving away the power to change things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. He advocates for personal responsibility, stating that blaming others for one's own decisions is unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.

His perspective on life and challenges has been deeply shaped by the loss of his first son, Ian, five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. He openly discusses death, believing it's not the ultimate end and that facing such profound pain puts other challenges, like work failures or financial losses, into perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. He views misfortunes as opportunities for learning and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>.

Ray Chan believes that time is the most scarce resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>, emphasizing the importance of treasuring time with loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. He lives by the motto "it all shall pass" when facing rough times in life or business, reminding people that most issues are not "life or death" and can be overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

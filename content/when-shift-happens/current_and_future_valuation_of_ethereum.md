## Recent Performance and Challenges

In 2023, [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] has experienced significant underperformance in USD terms and even more so against [[bitcoin_valuation_and_future_predictions | BTC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Holding [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] has been described as an "extremely painful asset to hold for the last two years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This has led to questions about the future of assets priced in [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]], such as [[NFTs and their pricing in Ethereum | NFTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Case for Outperformance: NFTs and ETH

A key argument for the outperformance of [[NFTs and their pricing in Ethereum | NFTs]] is that they are priced in [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] rather than dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. If [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] is not "cooked forever" and finishes a cycle with a significant uplift (e.g., 2x to 5x), buying art when [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] prices are low could lead to substantial multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This creates a "double kicker" effect: first from the rise in [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]]'s value, and second from increased art sales as people make money, leading to [[NFTs and their pricing in Ethereum | art]] outperforming [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Recent sales activity has seen many dollar buyers enter the market as [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] became cheaper in dollar terms during a correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Is Ethereum "Cooked"? Competing Narratives

There is a prevalent narrative that [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] is "cooked," suggesting that developers were wrong, the ecosystem is flawed with its [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | layer one]] and [[the_evolution_and_future_of_ethereum_layer_2_solutions | layer twos]], and that platforms like [[comparison_of_ethereum_with_other_blockchain_platforms | Solana]] will take over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

However, a counter-narrative suggests that [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] has merely "overbuilt capacity" for its current needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While there may be adjustments to the accrual mechanism back to the [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | layer one]], the core strength lies in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Enterprise Adoption and the Lindy Effect

[[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] is compared to Microsoft in the enterprise world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Just as major companies use Microsoft because "you don't get fired" and it's difficult to extract once implemented, [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] has achieved an "enterprise sales model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This phenomenon, similar to banks still using COBOL, highlights resistance to change when a system is working and adoption risk is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

[[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] has gone through its "Lindy effect," demonstrating that it works very well for the needs of financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It can build [[the_evolution_and_future_of_ethereum_layer_2_solutions | layer twos]] (as Coinbase has shown) for specific needs, and the [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | layer 1]] chain offers high security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. With ongoing developments like ZK-rollups, the necessary infrastructure is in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The expectation is that major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are highly unlikely to build on platforms like [[comparison_of_ethereum_with_other_blockchain_platforms | Solana]], but are highly likely to build their own [[the_evolution_and_future_of_ethereum_layer_2_solutions | layer twos]] on [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. These institutions have been involved in the [[the_current_state_and_future_of_the_crypto_industry | crypto space]] since 2015 and are already building on [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Financial Product Appeal and Future Outlook

[[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] also offers a yield, making it an attractive product for financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It is anticipated that [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] will find a new narrative in the current market, helping it to lift and catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The expectation is that [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] will not massively underperform from here and will likely outperform [[bitcoin_valuation_and_future_predictions | Bitcoin]] for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Looking out five years, if fundamental errors are avoided, [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] is expected to be incredibly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### The Evolving Narrative

Similar to [[bitcoin_valuation_and_future_predictions | Bitcoin]]'s journey from being hated in a previous cycle and attempts to define it as a payment system, only for it to settle as a "store of value," [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | ETH]] needs a clearly defined narrative that sticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This new narrative is likely to revert to its "world computer" idea: the platform for tokenization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Like other major crypto assets, [[the_evolving_narrative_and_importance_of_ethereum | Ethereum]] is going through a phase where "everyone midcurves it," questioning everything about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. However, it is expected to emerge with its initial premise solidified: a compute platform that operates at a global scale and is decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

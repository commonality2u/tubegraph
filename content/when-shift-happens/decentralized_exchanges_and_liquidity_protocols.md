[[the_development_of_decentralized_trading_networks | Decentralized exchanges]] (DEXs) and liquidity protocols are fundamental to the crypto market, offering alternatives to traditional financial systems and [[challenges_with_centralized_exchanges_and_trust_in_crypto | centralized exchanges]]. JP Thor, an engineer, investor, and founder of Thorchain, highlights their importance and the philosophy behind their development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Thorchain: A Leading Liquidity Protocol
Thorchain is described as the world's largest liquidity protocol, boasting a market value of over $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It enables cross-chain swaps without reliance on centralized entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### Founder's Journey to Decentralized Liquidity
JP Thor's background includes serving in the Air Force, flying fighters and bombers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. He entered the Bitcoin space in 2013, when Bitcoin was priced around $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. His early experiences in crypto shaped his vision for [[the_development_of_decentralized_trading_networks | decentralized liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

He invested $4,000 into Bitcoin in 2013, witnessing its price jump from $100 to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. He advocated for Bitcoin as a new financial system that removes the need for trust, allows anyone to contribute, and solves the problem of a decentralized mint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

### Challenges with Centralized Exchanges
Thor's commitment to [[decentralization_vs_centralization_in_crypto_platforms | decentralization]] was solidified by negative experiences with [[challenges_with_centralized_exchanges_and_trust_in_crypto | centralized exchanges]]:
*   **Mt. Gox Incident:** He narrowly avoided significant losses by moving his Bitcoin off Mt. Gox before its hack in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **BTC-e Take Down:** His Bitcoin held on BTC-e was taken down by the FBI, leading him to "declare war" on centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **High Fees:** He observed centralized exchanges demanding substantial listing fees (e.g., $300,000-$600,000) and monthly market maker fees ($100,000), effectively "blowing up" project treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. This system was viewed as a "centralized change Ponzi game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

These experiences led him to question why decentralized currencies were being traded on centralized databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## The Concept of Decentralized Liquidity
Recognizing the limitations of existing solutions like Atomic Swaps – which involved an eight-step, complex user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a> – Thor envisioned a simpler approach for [[the_development_of_decentralized_trading_networks | on-chain liquidity]].

### The "Fruit Basket" Analogy
Thor explains [[using_liquidity_pools_and_yield_farms_on_nexus_protocol | liquidity pools]] using a "fruit basket" analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>:
> "It's a fruit basket and the fruit basket has one rle, yeah? It's got a basket of 10 apples and 10 oranges and if you put in an apple the fruit basket will spit out oranges and you put in Orange it'll spit out apples, right? And it's got 10 apples 10 oranges and you rock up and give it one apple how many oranges will it spit out and that was the way I thought about it it's was 1 / 10 + 1 1 1id 11 which is basically .9 1 so it will spit out 91 oranges because then the fruit basket can operate at any price curve you could Rock up with a billion apples and it will still give you some amount of oranges without going insolvent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
This "fruit basket idea" became the basis for Thorchain's [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_decentralized_exchanges | on-chain liquidity pool]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

## Addressing Current Challenges in DeFi

### Complexity and User Adoption
Thor notes a significant gap in user numbers between [[impact_of_centralized_and_decentralized_exchanges_on_the_crypto_market | centralized exchanges]] like Binance (200 million users) and decentralized wallets like MetaMask (20 million users), with [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] protocols seeing even fewer users (2 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. This disparity is attributed to [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]]'s complexity, requiring a "giant decentralized friendly brand" to bring in 100 million users safely on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>. He is currently building "Stack Us Swap" to address this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>.

### Secure Self-Custody: Voltis Wallet
Users are often intimidated by self-custody due to single-signature wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>. To solve this, Thor developed Voltis, a multi-factor wallet built around a hardcore MPZ (Multi-Party Computation) protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.
> "Voltis is just a safe wallet that's multi-factor... you basically need two devices to sign a transaction so if a hacker downloads your phone... you're not going to lose all your money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.
Voltis is open-source and audited, supporting all chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>. Thor rejects the notion of money staying offline in cold storage, advocating for safe online crypto via multi-factor devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. He has "declared war on seed phrases," believing they should be replaced by multi-factor solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>.

### Rekindling the DeFi Flame: Project Chaos
[[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] is currently perceived as "not exciting," with attention shifting to memecoins and centralized finance (CeFi), which Thor despises due to their inherent centralization and reliance on multisigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.
To "rekindle the [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] flame," Thor is launching "Project Chaos," aiming to "attack all of [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] via vampire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. He plans to raise $20-30 million for protocol-versus-protocol wars, governance attacks, and liquidity attacks to make [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] fun again and attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:16">[01:22:16]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Memes and Building in Public
Thor emphasizes that "memes drive the narrative and the narrative drives the price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Every token is essentially a "meme coin," acting as a high-velocity meme to extract value from a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He chose Norse mythology for Thorchain to leverage existing "memetic power" and cultural narratives, enabling broader adoption and recognition, especially with ties to Marvel's Thor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

He advocates for "building in public" and "setting the memes free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. Building in secret is seen as withholding useful information from humanity for personal value extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Thor rejects NDAs, copyrights, trademarks, and patents, believing good ideas should flourish by being open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. This approach accelerates idea spread, makes projects more investable, and demonstrates a founder's ability to navigate adversity publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.

Initially building Thorchain under an anonymous identity ("Lena") allowed him to decentralize the project fully before revealing his identity, ensuring the protocol could operate independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. Once decentralized, he believes it is safe to come out publicly, as the chain can no longer be unilaterally controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

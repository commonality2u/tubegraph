Entrepreneurs often seek ways to [[balancing_high_ambitions_with_mental_health | optimize their brain and body function]] to cope with the intense demands of building a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. However, personal experiences with various biohacking methods suggest that many approaches have limited effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.

## Dietary Approaches
Different dietary regimens have been explored, including:
*   **Carnivore diets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>
*   **Keto diets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>

While these diets can make a huge difference for some individuals, especially those with conditions like depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>, they do not universally provide a noticeable difference in mental clarity or energy for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. The speaker, for instance, reported no significant mental clarity boost from diet changes, despite losing 50 pounds and feeling more energy and happier with their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_nutrition_and_lifestyle_on_mental_clarity | individual variability]] in dietary responses.

## Supplements and Nootropics
A wide array of supplements and nootropics have been tested:
*   **General supplements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a> – Most were found to have little effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>.
*   **Piracetam and related substances** – These were found to "not barely do anything" in terms of cognitive enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>.
*   **Stimulants (e.g., Amphetamine, Modafinil)** – These clearly have a cognitive effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
    *   **Amphetamine**: Known downsides include increased heart rate and blood pressure, potential for addiction, and a "crash" after use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. While there are circumstances where they might make sense (e.g., high-stakes exams, crisis situations), they should only be used under a doctor's supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.
    *   **Modafinil**: Appears to have fewer bodily side effects than amphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a> and a better safety profile than caffeine, with no reported overdoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. The main downside is its long half-life, making it difficult to sleep if taken late in the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>. A version with a shorter half-life exists but is not commercialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.

## Longevity
Exploration into the longevity space has also yielded few concrete answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.
*   **Metformin**: While beneficial for diabetics, its effectiveness for general longevity is speculative, with some indications it might do something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>.
*   **Resveratrol**: A substance once widely promoted for longevity, it showed promise in short-lived species like rats and flies, but these benefits did not translate to longer-lived species like monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. Calorie restriction, another popular longevity strategy, also does not seem to do much for larger organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.

The constant change in recommendations from "longevity experts" online, often justified by "new information," makes it hard to trust these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>. The conclusion reached after delving into this "rabbit hole" was that there's probably "nothing that really works" for dramatic longevity extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

## Fundamental Pillars for Health and Performance
Despite the pursuit of advanced biohacks and supplements, the most impactful strategies for optimizing health and performance remain the basics:
*   **Getting enough sleep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. Many people overlook sufficient sleep while seeking complex cognitive enhancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.
*   **Exercise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. While the speaker personally didn't feel a direct mental clarity boost from exercise, they acknowledge its general importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.
*   **A decent diet** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

For [[mental_health_and_personal_development | personal well-being]] during stressful times, such as the public slandering faced by the speaker, [[personal_resilience_and_adaptability | resilience]] and the passage of time proved most helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. Short-term use of doctor-prescribed anxiolytics provided significant, albeit temporary, relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. Therapy also had a moderately positive effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

The current global economic landscape is characterized by significant wealth concentration and an unequal distribution of capital. A trillion dollars sits unproductively in the top 13 companies, earning interest rather than funding productive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Joining the "capital class" is prohibitively expensive in traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, contributing to increasing global inequality where the rich get richer and the middle class is squeezed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This has fostered a negative sentiment towards capitalism, especially among youth in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Web3 as a Solution for Capitalism

Web3, with its emphasis on [[the_power_and_influence_of_digital_assets | digital assets]] and digital property rights, is proposed as an engine to provide a more equitable economic framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It allows everyone to become a stakeholder, enabling mass distributed ownership that is impractical in the physical world due to administrative and governmental complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

### Expanding the Capital Class

In Web3, even owning a small [[The future of the crypto market | meme coin]] makes an individual a member of the capital class with a capital asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This contrasts with traditional finance, where only a small capital class exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The goal is to increase the capital class by improving financial literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Web3 companies actively invest in the ecosystem, unlike Web2 giants like Apple or Google, which rarely invest back into the communities that generate their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Investing back into the ecosystem is seen as more beneficial than pure extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

### Digital Property Rights and Anoka Brands' Mission

Anoka Brands, a Web3 leader in gaming, [[The Role of NFTs and Blockchain in Future Investments | NFTs]], and venture capital, aims to deliver true digital property rights. Their mission is to reshape and save capitalism by making everyone a capitalist and an equity holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

For instance, if pension funds invested in fractional shares of real estate instead of cash, citizens would be in a much better financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. Web3 offers the framework for such mass distributed ownership, allowing billions of people to become asset owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

## Impact of NFTs and Meme Coins

[[The Evolution and Value of NFTs in Digital Culture | NFTs]] are not going away, with monthly sales between $1 billion and $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. While prices of some collections like Bored Apes might fluctuate in ETH value, their USD value can remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Bored Apes are considered highly important [[The Role of NFTs and Blockchain in Future Investments | NFTs]] that introduced Web3 to the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>, serving as cultural artifacts akin to "Warhols of our generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.

Meme coins are viewed as a cultural phenomenon reflecting the current unequal era and a younger generation's search for hope and opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Successful meme coins often have structures that distribute tokens to everyone from day one, with no investor tokens, operating on open and transparent rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. They are becoming a new category of [[the_power_and_influence_of_digital_assets | digital assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, similar to how luxury brands became cultural memes of their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Financial Literacy Through Web3 Gaming

Web3, particularly through [[digital_asset_policies_and_the_future_of_web_3_gaming | blockchain gaming]], has enabled millions of people, even those without formal education, to become financially included through crypto wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This has even influenced politics, with pro-crypto stances becoming necessary for mayoral elections in places like the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

The most effective way to increase financial literacy in Web3 is not through direct education, but by creating engaging experiences like [[digital_asset_policies_and_the_future_of_web_3_gaming | gaming]] that implicitly teach people the value of assets and an investing mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Humans naturally possess an "investing mindset" â€“ they take risks daily in various aspects of life, not just financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Crypto offers a sense of opportunity, even with small investments, sparking hope and showing people that their "lot in life" is not fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Lessons Learned in Web3

Early beliefs in Web3, such as [[digital_asset_policies_and_the_future_of_web_3_gaming | gaming utility]] alone being sufficient for adoption, proved incomplete. The liquidity provided by "DeFi summer" was crucial for validating ownership and enabling concepts like play-to-earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. Strong financial rails are now considered essential for Web3 projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

Another shift in belief is regarding Web2 to Web3 adoption. Simply giving users wallets and access to [[the_power_and_influence_of_digital_assets | digital assets]] is not enough. True Web3 adoption requires users to become financially literate and understand the meaning of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>. Web3 games should integrate financial literacy into tutorials to facilitate this understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Education is expected to be a major narrative in Web3, similar to how [[digital_asset_policies_and_the_future_of_web_3_gaming | Web3 gaming]] gained prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. Education is a $5 trillion industry, much larger than gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. Web3 can enable more value to go directly to teachers and creators, bypassing extractive intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

Health is also considered a form of wealth, and Web3 can facilitate data ownership and sharing of medical records in a secure, zero-knowledge way to enable deeper analysis and improve global health outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.

The [[the_future_of_the_crypto_market | crypto market]] is predicted to continue accelerating in growth, driven by developments like Ethereum and [[Future of Bitcoin DeFi | Bitcoin]] spot ETFs in various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>. [[digital_asset_policies_and_the_future_of_web_3_gaming | Web3 gaming]] will also continue to drive new communities into the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>.

While the [[the_future_of_the_crypto_market | crypto market]] is inherently volatile, this is a natural characteristic of capitalism, which drives progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. The key is to manage risk and prepare for volatility rather than trying to predict market tops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. Web3 encourages the growth of angel investors within the community, showcasing a shift in value sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

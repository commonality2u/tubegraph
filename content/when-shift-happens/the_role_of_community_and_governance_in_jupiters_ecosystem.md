From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

Jupiter, a leading decentralized trading platform on Solana, places a significant emphasis on community engagement and robust governance processes to drive its growth and realize its long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:31">[01:47:31]</a>. The organization views its community as a fundamental pillar for success, contrasting its approach with traditional business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>.

## Building and Growing the Community

Jupiter's strategy revolves around fostering a deeply engaged and bought-in community. This approach is seen as crucial for the long-term viability and expansion of the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:39">[09:38:39]</a>.

### The Purpose of Airdrops
Airdrops, such as the major Jupe airdrop, are not simply about giving away free money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:30">[09:13:30]</a>. Instead, they are designed to:
*   **Grow the community meaningfully** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:20">[09:18:20]</a>.
*   **Give users a sense of ownership** over the protocol's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:25">[09:20:25]</a>.
*   **Combat apathy**, which can undermine decentralized protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:28">[09:27:28]</a>.

The first Jupe airdrop in 2024 was a massive catalyst for both product and community growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:47">[10:04:47]</a>. The latest airdrop, which involved distributing approximately $700-800 million worth of tokens, was intended to make recipients feel appreciated and part of the process, rather than simply "happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:25">[08:22:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:08">[08:50:08]</a>. This initiative was part of a larger effort to invite active members and users familiar with the product to become core parts of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:51">[11:17:51]</a>.

### Community Events: Catstanbul
Jupiter hosted "Catstanbul," its first community conference in Istanbul, Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:04">[13:55:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. This event saw a remarkable turnout of around 1,400 to 1,700 people, with attendees flying in from all over the world, including New Zealand, Argentina, China, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:30">[15:15:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. The physical presence and high attendance demonstrated the strong energy and dedication within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:43">[18:05:43]</a>.

## Decentralized Governance in Action

Jupiter's commitment to decentralization extends to its governance model, ensuring that the community actively participates in key decisions.

### The Airdrop Allocation Vote
A significant demonstration of Jupiter's [[Governance and decisionmaking on Nexus Protocol | governance process]] was the vote on the user airdrop allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:46">[06:39:46]</a>.
*   Initially, a proposal for a 70% buy-in threshold faced strong backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   The first vote by the DAO did not pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   Despite challenges, a second proposal was put forth and successfully passed, achieving 87-90% community approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   This process involved collecting over 12,000 pieces of verified feedback across various platforms like Discord, research forums, and Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   The outcome demonstrated that DAOs, despite common skepticism, can make good decisions when structured with proper alignment, feedback processes, and iterative loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## Jupiter's Broader Strategy: Aggregate, Align, Accelerate

Jupiter's overall strategy is encapsulated in three core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>:

1.  **Aggregate:** To bring together all liquidity, products, communities, and technologies into one easy-to-access place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>.
    *   This includes aggregating products (spot, perpetuals, token lists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.
    *   Aggregating community (work groups, Discord, forums) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
    *   And aggregating technologies (cryptography, blockchain designs, UX innovations) via JupNet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

2.  **Align:** To ensure that all participants—users, developers, partner projects, and the DAO—are aligned through shared values, incentives, and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20:00">[25:20:00]</a>. The Jupe token itself serves as a "symbol of alignment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.
    *   This involves aligning incentive structures, like fee distribution and participation mechanisms, across projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>.
    *   It also focuses on aligning the needs of the DAO and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>.

3.  **Accelerate:** To dramatically and permanently change the inflection curve of Web3 technology adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>. This is achieved by making products easier and safer to use, reducing chain fragmentation, and fostering a strong community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[26:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>.

### Jupe Token and Trust
The Jupe token's value strategy is rooted in building trust and certainty within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:22:00">[59:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.
*   Jupiter enacted a significant burn of 3.5 billion SHRAP and 3 billion JUP tokens, and emissions were cut by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:04]</a>.
*   This was a voluntary decision by the team, including cutting 600 million JUP from their own allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   The team also committed to holding most of their vested tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.
*   These actions aimed to reduce community anxiety about high potential token supply and ensure a healthy circulating supply, fostering a trusted and well-managed emission strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.
*   A key element is the DAO buyback program, where 50% of protocol fees from jup.ag will be used to accumulate (not burn) the Jupe token, creating a flywheel effect where product success benefits token holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

The overarching goal is for the Jupe token to be a "key strategic resource" and a powerful "alignment tool" for the community to grow the crypto meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

## The Importance of Trust and Long-Term Vision

Jupiter emphasizes that for any project, especially celebrity-backed ones, [[The importance of community and longterm thinking in the crypto industry | building trust]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. This is achieved by:
*   Spending time with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.
*   Having brand equity with crypto natives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>.
*   Designing pre-launch and post-launch communications to reassure people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.
*   Focusing on long-term vision, not just short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

[!INFO] CertiFi Token Launch Tool
Jupiter will be releasing a new tool and service to help token creators provide greater "certainty, alignment, and transparency" to their token buyers, ensuring legitimacy and trust in launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.

Ultimately, Jupiter believes its success in 2025 and beyond will stem from its clear strategy, ability to execute across product, community, and technology, and its unwavering commitment to the decentralized vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:12">[01:28:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:25">[01:30:25]</a>. The energy and optimism observed at community gatherings like Catstanbul reflect the strong support and growth potential of its [[Building a Decentralized Community and Ecosystem | decentralized ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.

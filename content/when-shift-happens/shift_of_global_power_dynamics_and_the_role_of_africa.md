David Shin, a leader at Immutable X who actively shapes digital asset policies and advises central banks, discusses the shifting global power dynamics, particularly the decline of the US dollar's dominance and Africa's emerging role in this new landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. His insights stem from years in investment banking and a deep understanding of [[global_macroeconomic_views_and_societal_reset_predictions | macroeconomic signals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

## The Eroding Dominance of the US Dollar

Shin believes the US dollar is on a path to no longer be the global intermediary currency for settling trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. This shift is driven by several factors:

### The Swift Network and Banking Practices
The Swift network, a consortium of banks, prioritizes larger global banks like JP Morgan and Citibank for interbank transfers, which bridge local and international transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:30">[04:30:30]</a>. This prioritization leads to higher costs and significant latency (3-5 business days) for cross-border payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The delay allows banks to create short-term pools of funds for interbank lending, where they generate profit through mechanisms like Libor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:38">[06:37:38]</a>. Shin argues that while banks need to make money, their reliance on risk-taking to generate profit (e.g., creating investment arms from commercial bank deposits) leads to financial bubbles, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:08:39]</a>.

### De-dollarization Trends
A significant trend observed by Shin is de-dollarization, where countries move away from relying on the US dollar for trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>.
*   **Iran and the EU:** Examples include Iran and eventually the EU choosing to de-dollarize to directly purchase Iranian oil, bypassing US sanctions and the Swift network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. The EU created a separate entity to facilitate these direct dealings, signifying a major turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **BRICS Expansion:** The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) bloc, initially an economic concept by Goldman Sachs, has evolved into a formal membership group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a>. Recent additions include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. BRICS aims to create an alternative trading system that avoids Swift and the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. Shin believes this alternative will be a [[crypto_and_blockchains_role_in_global_finance | blockchain-based digital currency]], whether a CBDC or stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

### The Role of China
China is strategically preparing for a future less reliant on the US dollar.
*   **Sanctions Readiness:** During the extended COVID-19 lockdown, particularly in Shanghai, China conducted a "dry run" for sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. Shanghai, being the most internationally exposed city in China, was used to test how the population and systems would react under isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.
*   **Digital Currency Development:** China has already tested and piloted its e-RMB and has discussed direct swaps for settlement within BRICS, indicating their readiness to circumvent the US dollar if sanctioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.

Shin predicts that if China moves on Taiwan (between now and 2027), triggering Western sanctions against China, it will accelerate the shift away from the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>. This would create a domino effect, with other countries trading with China also reducing their reliance on the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.

## Africa: The Emerging Benefactor
In this evolving global landscape, Shin identifies Africa as the biggest benefactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

*   **Geopolitical Neutrality:** Africa is the most geopolitically neutral continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. Unlike countries like India or Singapore, which are exposed to both Western and Eastern influences, Africa has largely avoided siding with major global powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>. The Chinese presence in Africa, building infrastructure, is seen as transactional rather than political alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.
*   **Abundant Resources:** Africa possesses over 30% of the world's resources and 60% of its arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. As globalization faces challenges and countries become more insular, issues like supply chain disruptions, food scarcity, and mineral access will become more pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>. Africa is poised to become the world's marketplace for these critical resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.
*   **African Union's Role:** The African Union, comprising 52 or 54 countries, operates similarly to the European Union, representing a collective voice rather than individual national stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. This unified approach allows African nations to maintain a more arms-length and neutral position in global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>.

## The Role of Blockchain and Web3
Blockchain and Web3 technologies are not just "cool pieces of technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>. They are at the forefront of changing how countries trade and settle payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>. The development of [[crypto_and_blockchains_role_in_global_finance | blockchain-based settlement rails]] will enable greater [[decentralization_and_the_current_financial_system | decentralization]] in global finance, empowering continents like Africa to democratize their resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:43">[01:22:43]</a>. However, Shin also cautions that increased online activity and traceability could inadvertently give more power back to governments, making it a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

The cryptocurrency ecosystem has faced significant [[Challenges and risks in the crypto ecosystem | challenges related to trust]], particularly concerning centralized exchanges (CEXs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Events like the FTX collapse highlighted inherent risks, leading to widespread loss of funds and a renewed focus on decentralized alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Issues with Centralized Exchanges

The primary issue with centralized exchanges is the requirement for users to trust a third party with their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Historical incidents have shown that centralized entities can misuse user funds, spending them on unauthorized activities, which directly resulted in people losing all their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Despite these catastrophic failures, users often quickly revert to using centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This suggests that the user experience (UX) and perceived convenience of CEXs currently outweigh the inherent risks for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. To truly shift users towards [[decentralization_vs_centralization_in_crypto_platforms | decentralized platforms]], the products and financial systems offered by decentralized finance (DeFi) need to significantly improve to offer a superior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Extractive Nature of the Crypto Industry

A significant [[Challenges and risks in the crypto industry | challenge in the crypto industry]] is its often extractive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. Many crypto projects are designed to extract value from retail participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the original crypto ethos of transparency and user control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

Examples of value extraction include:
*   **Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)**: In 2017, many ICOs involved projects generating hype, selling tokens to the public, and then the founders dumping their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.
*   **Venture Capital (VC) Backed Projects**: A more sophisticated method involves projects raising multiple funding rounds from VCs, garnering social media attention, and making "under the table deals" with influential figures to get them tokens at a low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. These tokens are then listed on major centralized exchanges, where retail investors, or "suckers," buy in at high prices, leading to subsequent dumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

While these actions might not always lead to legal repercussions, they are considered unethical and destroy value within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. Such practices provide regulators with examples to label crypto as a "cesspool of scams," hindering broader adoption and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.

The inherent freedom and programmability of money in crypto, while revolutionary, also make it easier for malicious actors to create scams and exploit less informed participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.

## Building Trust Through User-Centric Products

The solution to these [[Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto | challenges]] lies in building products that genuinely benefit users and prioritize their experience, rather than focusing on extractive models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. The prevailing model of "token production industry" where tokens are created and sold, primarily serving as a means of extraction, makes it difficult to attract and retain genuine users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

Projects like Hyperliquid aim to offer a stark contrast to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. By building a high-performance, purely on-chain financial system, they aspire to become the "Amazon Web Service of liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This involves:
*   **Prioritizing the End User**: Creating a new way of doing finance that is more focused on the end user than traditional models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
*   **Community-First Approach**: Adopting a [[Decentralized exchanges and liquidity protocols | community-first]] and anti-establishment stance, rejecting the traditional model of relying on VCs or incentivizing market makers as primary beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Product**: Building a product that users love and use, ensuring that the platform's success comes from its utility and user satisfaction rather than speculative schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

This approach emphasizes that for crypto to achieve widespread adoption and fulfill its potential as a reinvention of the financial system, it must offer superior products that address real-world needs and operate with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

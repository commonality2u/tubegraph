To [[strategies_for_getting_rich_with_crypto_ai_agents | get rich with crypto AI agents]] without relying on luck, it is crucial to understand the distinction between a high-value agent and a commodity agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:23">[01:35:23]</a>.

## High-Value Agents

High-value agents are characterized by having a "moat" or a unique value accrual mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a>. They address a strong problem statement and are not easily replicated by generic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>. A high-value agent possesses an "edge" in its model, data, or action space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:55">[01:36:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

Key characteristics of high-value agents include:
*   **Solving a Real Pain Point** They address an actual problem that people face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:22">[01:37:22]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Information/Data** They leverage unique data or information creation pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:41">[01:37:41]</a>.
*   **Advanced Capabilities** They can control wallets, influence humans, and interact with other agents autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. Many operate at "level three" autonomy, where they are goal-driven and self-sufficient, unlike "level one" agents that require human prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
*   **Not Easily Disrupted** Their specialized nature makes them difficult for competitors to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.

### Examples of High-Value Agents

*   **Luna** - Luna is an AI agent that achieved significant attention by demonstrating the ability to autonomously control a crypto wallet to influence humans and other agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. This showcased a "level three" autonomous agent capability, a breakthrough at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Luna's ability to produce continuous content and build a follower base makes it difficult to differentiate from a human, offering a unique edge in marketing and narrative shaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:37">[01:43:37]</a>.
*   **XBT** - This agent went viral because it solved a critical problem: "what token do I buy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. The team behind XBT spent months building an information creation pipeline, giving it a unique information edge that, when combined with autonomous agency, created significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:32">[01:37:32]</a>.
*   **Sports Commentary Agent (Hypothetical)** - An agent trained on proprietary basketball analytics and coaching strategies that acts as a sounding board for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>. If linked to high-liquidity markets like sports betting, it could become a cash-cow agent by leveraging its unique insights to convince users to place bets, thereby capturing significant value flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:06">[01:40:06]</a>.
*   **Internet Water Army (Controversial)** - This refers to a network of social media bots that can shape narratives and flood social media to drown out negative stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:35">[01:42:35]</a>. If autonomous agents can produce human-like content and continuously build follower accounts, they could become effective "soldiers" in such an army, making it nearly impossible to differentiate them from humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:37">[01:43:37]</a>. This represents an "insane marketing use case" and "narrative shaping use case," with potential for influencing elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:14">[01:44:14]</a>. The value capture comes from the ability to spawn agents that sound human-like and distribute this as a service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>.

## Commodity Agents

Commodity agents are those that offer easily replicable or "commoditized functions" without a unique edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09">[01:36:09]</a>. They typically have no moat or value accrual mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a>.

### Examples of Commodity Agents

*   **DoorDash Ordering Agent** - An agent whose primary function is to order food through DoorDash is considered a commodity agent because anyone can easily build one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:17">[01:36:17]</a>.
*   **Generic Twitter Poster** - An agent that merely posts on Twitter using generic APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:01">[01:38:01]</a>.
*   **Amazon Gift-Buying Agent** - An agent that buys gifts off Amazon using generic APIs does not deserve a token, as this is a commoditized function easily done through other tools like GPT operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>.

## Investing in Crypto AI Agents

To [[building_wealth_with_crypto_and_ai | build wealth with crypto and AI]] and avoid relying on luck, investors should focus on agents that possess specialized capabilities and a clear, non-commoditized value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a>. Betting on commoditized functions is unlikely to lead to significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a>. Jensen Tang suggests that for those interested in the thesis on where high-value agents can exist, resources like the "Agent starter" platform can be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>.

The role of government in regulating cryptocurrency is a significant and often contentious issue, heavily influencing the trajectory and adoption of digital assets. Discussions on this topic often highlight concerns about centralized power, public trust, and the potential for new financial systems to challenge traditional ones.

## The Case of Libra

Facebook's ambitious Libra project aimed to create a blockchain-based digital currency, intended to be run by a consortium of over 20 organizations with a future view towards decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. The core mission was to make sending money across the internet as easy as sending an email, leveraging Facebook's existing messaging product distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

However, the project ultimately failed due to significant governmental and public resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. The primary concern for nation-states was the prospect of "two billion people have a bank account, the bank of Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, creating an entity "bigger than every country in the world GDP wise" and "the biggest bank ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. This scenario was deemed "scary" due to the unknown "second and third order effects" it could have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.

Public trust issues also played a crucial role, with many expressing sentiments like "I don't trust Facebook," viewing it as an existing monopoly with potential for unchecked power over financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>. The perception that Facebook would "make a decision on who is in that basket" of currencies, despite intentions, contributed to this distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

### "Kill the Messenger"
The speaker suggests that the perception of Facebook as the messenger was a major hurdle: "it's just the messenger what got killed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. While acknowledging Mark Zuckerberg's entrepreneurial spirit for attempting such an ambitious project, it's believed that a "step-by-step approach" or using an existing stablecoin might have been better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. Tokenizing the US dollar on a blockchain, for example, could have positioned it as a "great distribution Network for the dollar" and a "great dollarization tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>.

However, unlike [[crypto_adoption_and_the_role_of_blockchain_in_future_investments | Bitcoin]]'s gradual adoption, Libra's potential for "overnight" mass adoption of a [[crypto_and_blockchains_role_in_global_finance | bank of Facebook]] was seen as too rapid and disruptive for governments to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

## Government Power and Centralization

The halting of Libra highlights the significant power governments wield over large technology companies and, by extension, over personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. This power allows them to "effectively medal in private Enterprise at will" under the guise of "public good" or "public interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. Instances where basic questions about a company's business model are asked in public forums indicate a tendency for "grand standing" rather than addressing core issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

Recent events, such as the arrest of a Telegram founder, further illustrate this trend: "it's not just 'Hey guys, you're too big, you can't do that Facebook,' it's 'hey, if you don't comply with us, we'll come after you, we'll come after you and we'll throw you to jail'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. This dynamic, extending from TikTok to Telegram, suggests a limited window for the full decentralization of online services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>.

### Decentralization as a Solution
A key argument in favor of decentralization is its ability to counteract such centralized demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Building fully decentralized applications and infrastructure, like storage layers and networking layers, could prevent a single party from dictating terms or shutting down services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. The concept of a "neutral platform" akin to Switzerland's neutrality is seen as ideal, where rules are clear, and participation is voluntary, fostering a fairer environment for business and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. This contrasts sharply with "Enterprise blockchain," which often succumbs to control issues where "people want to make up the rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.

## Regulatory Outlook for Crypto

Looking ahead, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is expected to become "a lot less hostile," though "clarity will not be there next year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:56">[01:48:56]</a>. Political figures, including the Biden and Harris administrations, are increasingly perceived as more crypto-friendly, recognizing the growing interest among youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:05">[01:49:05]</a>. This shift suggests a move away from the current "great Casino" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a> perception of crypto towards more mainstream adoption, where users interact with [[crypto_adoption_and_the_role_of_blockchain_in_future_investments | crypto infrastructure]] without necessarily realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.

## Bitcoin and Government/Centralization

[[Crypto as a Solution to Banking Issues | Bitcoin]] is seen as embodying a "financial system that the people deserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. Its design, with no inflation and transparent, provable ownership, offers a stark contrast to traditional banking systems where "bail ins" can jeopardize personal funds and governments can dilute monetary value through debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>. Bitcoin's decentralized nature ensures "no single body that can take ownership of your asset or make rules around your asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.

However, even [[evolution_of_cryptocurrency_infrastructure | Bitcoin]] mining, by its nature, encourages concentration. To regularly win blocks and provide consistent rewards, miners are "forced to create concentrated pools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Historically, this has led to concerns, such as when `cex.io` controlled 51% of the network's mining power, prompting discussions among mining pools to reduce their concentration for the health of the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. Despite this inherent centralization in mining, Bitcoin's underlying principles remain appealing.

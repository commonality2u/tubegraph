The current global economic system faces challenges with capital concentration, where a "trillion dollars sits in the top 13 companies in the world" and remains unproductive, "sitting in a bank account collecting interest and doing nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This contributes to a world that is "becoming more unequal," with "the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, middle class is getting squeezed out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Joining the "capital class is expensive" in traditional finance, often requiring significant investments like real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This stark contrast highlights the need for a more equitable framework.

## Web3 as a Solution for Financial Inclusion

According to Yatu, Co-founder and Chairman at Anima Brands, Web3 is the "engine that can provide a more Equitable framework because everyone becomes a stakeholder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The core belief is that many global problems can be solved "if everyone becomes a capitalist as and becomes an equity holder of some form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

### Becoming a Capital Owner
In Web3, individuals can become members of the capital class with minimal investment. Even owning a "silly meme coin," regardless of its immediate price fluctuations, grants one a "capital asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This allows for financial inclusion, as one can start learning and gaining for "10 cents, one cent, $1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### NFTs and Meme Coins: Lowering the Barrier to Entry
While most [[Marketing and branding in web 3 and NFTs | NFT]] collections are perceived to be performing poorly, actual sales are still "anywhere from a billion to a billion and a half a month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. [[Digital Asset Policies and the Future of Web 3 Gaming | NFTs]] are seen as not "going away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> and represent "cultural artifacts of their time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

Meme coins are also described as "cultural phenomena" representing the current era, especially for the younger generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. The most successful meme coins are structured to "give tokens to everyone on day one," with "no investor tokens" and being "fully community farmed," fostering a "completely different narrative" of open and transparent rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. These are seen as a "new category of assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

### Financial Literacy Through Gaming
The Web3 gaming industry plays a crucial role in increasing financial literacy. Projects like Axi Infinity, Pixels, and Ronin in the Philippines have "created financial literacy of millions of people who do not have a university education" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Through crypto wallets and playing games, people can become "financially included" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This approach teaches people the "value of things and create an investing mindset" through engaging experiences, rather than abstract financial education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Direct Value Distribution (Airdrops)
Unlike traditional industries where advertising spend benefits large corporations (e.g., "$100 billion" spent by gaming companies on advertising, with "zero" going to the gamer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, Web3 facilitates direct value distribution. In the last three years, "$21.7 billion of airdrop tokens were given to the community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This mechanism allows "end users who have become your Champions" to be compensated and act as marketing agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

## The Anima Brands Mission
Anima Brands' mission is to "deliver true digital property rights" and ultimately "reshape and save capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. They believe Web3 can provide a framework for "mass distributed ownership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>, making it possible for billions to become asset owners, overcoming the administrative hurdles of physical asset ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

### Investing in the Ecosystem
Anima Brands, which is "probably the most prolific investor in web 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>, views investment not just for profit but as a way of "generating Goodwill and more value" by sharing "Good Fortune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. This contrasts with Web2 giants like Apple, Facebook, or Google, who "scarcely nothing" invest back into their ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Web3 companies, like Coinbase, OKX, and Binance, actively invest back into their respective ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. This "giving back to the ecosystem is always better than just simply extracting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

## The Importance of Education in Web3
Education is seen as a crucial non-consensus belief for the future of Web3, being a "$5 trillion space today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>, much larger than gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. The focus is on moving "financial rails of Education" to create more value, particularly for underpaid teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>. This aligns with the human innate desire to learn and can "create these powerful incentives to basically rewire our learning brains for more optimistic outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.

## Health as a Form of Wealth and Data Ownership
Health is considered "another form of wealth," possibly "even more important form of wealth" than financial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>. In Web3, the belief is that "we own our data and therefore the derivative and network effects of this data can then be shared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This allows for valuable health data to be used for personal optimization and, with technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, shared to "analyze problems more deeply without having these silos of data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

## Living with Volatility and Risk
Capitalism is inherently volatile, and "without it you wouldn't have disruptive Technologies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. The key is to "prepare yourself as a as as a business or as an individual for inherent volatility as long as we live in a capitalist system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. This involves managing risk, which can lead to success even in bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. The choice between freedom with volatility or state-controlled stability is framed as choosing freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

## The Future of Digital Ownership
The future of work is envisioned where AI and robotics take over most labor, necessitating humans to focus on "creating and inventing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. This requires individuals to "own the intellectual property," and Web3 provides the scalable means to protect and manage this digital ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. The goal is to move towards a society where every citizen can be a stakeholder and partake in the growth of capital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

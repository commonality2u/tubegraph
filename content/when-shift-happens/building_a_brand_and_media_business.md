Jason Yanowitz, co-founder and CEO of Blockworks, a \$135 million crypto media empire, shares his journey and insights into [[Building and scaling a successful business | building a successful media business]] and [[The importance of personal branding | personal branding]]. He emphasizes that for an entrepreneur trying to break into something, the two greatest "hacks" are building events and [[The role of social media in business success | building a brand on Twitter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurial Journey

Yanowitz's personal journey began with a dislike of the system and rules, stemming from his parents who were both entrepreneurs and college dropouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:20">[06:17:20]</a>. He describes himself as someone who likes to build things outside of normal rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:02">[07:01:02]</a>.

### Early Hustles and Lessons
From a young age, Yanowitz was "hustling to make money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:08">[06:27:08]</a>. This included buying baseball cards on eBay with bad marketing and reselling them with better marketing, and a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

The MLM experience, which he later recognized as a pyramid scheme, taught him profound lessons:
*   It's easy to get caught up in a system, even when friends and family point out its flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
*   He learned about selling and how to control his own destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.
*   It instilled a mindset of not wanting to work a 9-to-5 job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

After college, he briefly worked in finance, disliking the "archaic, bureaucratic systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a> and remembering being "laughed out of the room" for bringing up crypto venture deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.

## Founding Blockworks

Blockworks was started by Jason Yanowitz and his friend Mike, along with a third person who left early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. They were 23 or 24 years old with about \$5,000 each in their bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.

### The "Aha!" Moment and Initial Idea
Yanowitz's fascination with cryptocurrency began in 2015 while studying abroad in Hungary, where he met Hungarians whose parents lived under Soviet rule, leading them to embrace Bitcoin for its self-sovereign money aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. In 2017, inspired by a talk on Ethereum and a workshop on building consulting firms, he envisioned launching an Ethereum consulting firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.

However, his co-founder Mike suggested they couldn't do consulting yet because "nobody knows us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>. This led to the initial strategy: hosting events to [[Building a personal brand and its impact | build a brand]] and community, then selling consulting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.

### Early Mistakes and Bootstrapping
Blockworks initially focused on generating cash flow rather than building intellectual property (IP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. They hosted happy hours that generated \$10,000 profit per event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:00">[25:09:00]</a> and built podcasts for other people, like Anthony Pompliano, rather than their own in-house shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This was seen as a mistake because it didn't build a scalable business with owned IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. They didn't really focus on building their own in-house content until 2021, despite launching in December 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

Yanowitz believes the biggest mistake they made was "not betting on ourselves earlier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> and understanding how big they could make the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## Pivot to a True Media Company

In March 2020, with the onset of COVID-19, 82% of Blockworks' revenue from conferences was wiped out overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. This forced a "bet the farm" moment, shifting focus to digital revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.

The team whiteboarded out new strategies, considering everything from a "Morning Brew for crypto" to competing with CNBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[33:14:00]</a>. They realized that while existing crypto news outlets were doing a "six out of 10 job," nobody was doing it the way they wanted to receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>.

### Rebranding and Building IP
For nine months, they rebuilt, rebranding from "Blockworks Group" to "Blockworks" and focusing on becoming a true media business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:04:00]</a>. This involved:
*   **Cutting outsourced podcasts:** They ended contracts with podcasts they built for others to focus on owning their own shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>.
*   **Launching in-house content:** Yanowitz launched "Empire," and Mike launched "On the Margin." They also launched a newsletter and a new editorial website in Q1 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring:** Bringing in reporters and journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>.

## The Value of Different Business Models in Media

Yanowitz explains that not all revenue is valued equally by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:33:00">[27:33:00]</a>:
*   \$1 of conference revenue might be worth \$2 in valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.
*   \$1 of podcast revenue is worth \$5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.
*   \$1 of analytics revenue is worth \$15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.

This understanding of market valuation is crucial for long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>.

### Podcasting
[[Role of podcasting in personal branding and media | Podcasts]] are considered the "most intimate form of advertising" and content consumption, as hosts are "deep in your ears for a full hour," building trust with listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:40:00">[36:40:00]</a>. This makes podcasts a powerful form of brand awareness advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>.

### Conferences
While high-risk due to significant upfront costs (\$250,000 for a large conference versus \$5,000-10,000 for a happy hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>, successful large conferences can fund other parts of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>. Planning for conferences requires predicting market cycles six to nine months in advance, making it very difficult in a volatile market like crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>.

### Data Business
The data and analytics business is "incredibly important" as it forms the bottom of the funnel for Blockworks, driving enterprise valuation and creating a "negative customer acquisition cost model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>. Their media content (newsletters, podcasts, webinars) generates inbound leads for their research platform, eliminating the need for a separate sales and marketing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>.

## Building a Media Company Today

Yanowitz's thesis for building successful media companies today is:
1.  **B2B Media:** Focus on business-to-business media over business-to-consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:27:00">[44:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Product at the Bottom of the Funnel:** Integrate a product (like analytics) that sits at the end of the customer journey to create a sustainable model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:15:00">[47:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Owned Audience:** Focus on building an owned audience (podcast downloads, newsletter subscribers) rather than rented audiences (web traffic, social media followers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a>.
4.  **Trust over Clicks:** Traditional media companies failed by buying page views and clicks but not trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:34:00">[46:34:00]</a>. [[Trust and valuation in media companies | Trust is the most crucial element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:25:00">[46:25:00]</a>.

Blockworks' "unfair advantage" is having the combination of news, podcasts/newsletters (distribution/audience), conferences (cash flow), and a research/data business (enterprise valuation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>.

## Company Building and Leadership

### Starting Young vs. Working in the Field
While Blockworks started young, Yanowitz now believes that for someone launching a crypto business, it's better to work at a big brand (e.g., Coinbase, Solana) for a year to learn the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>. This makes fundraising and hiring "infinitely easier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.

### The Stages of Growth
Companies face different challenges at various employee counts due to organizational setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>:
*   **1-10 employees:** Founder is heavily involved, and hires are generalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>.
*   **10-50 employees:** People start to specialize, but a full leadership team isn't yet crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.
*   **Around 50+ employees:** A dedicated leadership team is essential. Blockworks got "stuck" at 50 employees for two years until they hired experienced leaders in editorial, events, tech, and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>.

### Hiring Strategy
Key non-negotiables for hiring are:
*   **Curiosity:** Essential in a fast-moving industry like crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>.
*   **"Airport Test":** Would you enjoy being stuck with this person for eight hours at an airport? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:32">[01:26:32]</a>.
For executive hires, aligning on "how you think" about problems is more important than just "how you do your work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>.

### Navigating Market Cycles and People Management
[[Insights into building and managing a business in the crypto industry | Building a company in crypto]] is challenging due to the market's cyclical and volatile nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:24">[01:29:24]</a>. Founders must clearly set expectations for their team across market phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>. This includes:
*   **Hiring in bear markets:** Hire amazing people at "normal prices" when others are panicking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:11">[01:31:11]</a>.
*   **Compensation:** Avoid succumbing to inflated salaries during bull markets, as these roles are often the first to be laid off when the market turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a>.
*   **Advertising:** Buy advertising in bear markets when rates are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:56">[01:33:56]</a>, similar to how Rolex increased its marketing budget during the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

## Raising Capital and Maintaining Authenticity

Blockworks bootstrapped for six years before raising \$12 million in May 2023 at a \$135 million post-money valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a>. Raising capital increases the stakes and shifts focus toward strategies that drive enterprise valuation, such as the analytics and research side of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:33:00">[51:33:00]</a>.

It's crucial to maintain authenticity and trust after raising capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:02:00">[52:02:00]</a>. For example, Blockworks refuses to take payments for guests to appear on their podcasts, as this would compromise trust, which is foundational to their brand's long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:02:00">[53:02:00]</a>.

## The Founder's Well-being and Vulnerability

Yanowitz reveals he suffers from cluster headaches, known as "suicide headaches" due to their intense pain, which can lead to a suicide rate 9 to 11 times higher than the average population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The pain is rated 10 out of 10 on a pain scale, higher than childbirth or a fractured bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:50:00">[56:50:00]</a>. He deals with them through nerve blocker injections, medication, oxygen tanks, and explores psilocybin treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:39:00">[59:39:00]</a>.

He chose to share this publicly to encourage other founders, many of whom experience physical manifestations of stress like rapid hair loss, back pain, or cluster attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. While there's a perception that sharing health issues makes one seem "weak" to investors, Yanowitz believes vulnerability can be a superpower, fostering deeper connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

For founders, burnout often stems from working on things that are not meaningful, rather than simply overworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>. Finding fulfillment in pushing the "boulder up the hill" is key to sustained effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>.

## Design and Market Predictions

### The Power of Design
Yanowitz strongly believes that "world-class design" is the easiest way for a small company to appear large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. He notes that when Blockworks launched its website, people immediately called them the "Bloomberg of crypto" based solely on the site's look and feel, despite having published no articles yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:19">[01:47:19]</a>. [[Marketing and branding in web 3 and NFTs | First impressions matter]], and design is often underestimated in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>.

### Crypto Market Outlook
Yanowitz predicts a "bull market that people can't really wrap their heads around" in the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:18]</a>. His conviction is strong due to factors like Bitcoin hitting all-time highs even with high interest rates, the dollar entering a bear market, and the upcoming election season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a>. He also highlights the underrated impact of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and the need for venture firms to re-engage with crypto strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:29">[01:49:29]</a>.

The crypto space presents unique challenges to ethical conduct due to its nascent regulatory environment and rapid market movements. Daryl V, co-founder of Tangent and a prominent crypto trader, emphasizes the importance of a personal moral code amidst these complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

## Navigating the "Gray" Areas

Daryl notes that the crypto world operates in a "gray" area, as many laws and regulations seen in traditional finance are not yet in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This necessitates that individuals define their own boundaries for ethical behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

A key example discussed is market manipulation:
*   **Tweeting Impact** If a tweet influences price, is it manipulation? In traditional equities, likely yes; in crypto, it's often perceived as "fair game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. This demonstrates how a lack of clear rules leads to differing interpretations of what is acceptable.

### The Influence of Greed and FOMO
Daryl observes that many participants "stray towards the grayer side of things" primarily due to [[behavioral_incentives_and_risks_in_the_crypto_space | greed and FOMO]] (Fear Of Missing Out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. The perception that others are making significant money can lead individuals to adopt tactics they wouldn't normally consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Social media, particularly platforms like Twitter and YouTube, contributes to this by propagating "we're all going to make it" or "meme coin super cycle" narratives, which people often "buy into" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## Core Ethical Principles

Daryl outlines three fundamental principles for operating in the crypto space:
*   **Don't cheat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>
*   **Don't lie** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>
*   **Don't hurt someone specifically** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>

He believes that upholding these three points throughout one's crypto career would make an individual "considerably better than most people" in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### Personal Moral Code
Daryl's personal moral code centers on avoiding harm to others. He strives to prevent any particular stakeholder from directly suffering at his hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. While selling tokens on an open market indirectly involves someone else buying, he distinguishes this from actively structuring a deal to convince someone to buy at a disadvantageous price, like the top of a market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. He views the former as "me versus the market," diluting the impact across a large number of participants, rather than directly exploiting an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

## The Zero-Sum Game Perspective

A critical aspect of crypto trading is recognizing its nature as a [[behavioral_incentives_and_risks_in_the_crypto_space | zero-sum game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Every time someone makes money, someone else is losing it, sooner or later, especially during "mega deleveraging events" at the end of cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Despite this, Daryl maintains that it's possible to operate with "great morals or great values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Trust in the Crypto Space

Daryl finds that few people can be truly trusted in crypto due to the prevalence of questionable practices he has witnessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This sentiment extends to the influence of content creators who often focus on driving FOMO and narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

### Scams and Systemic Issues
The crypto market, despite its evolution, remains susceptible to large-scale failures and scams. Daryl recounts how he himself advised his now-wife to custody Bitcoin with FTX, believing "if FTX goes down crypto is dead anyway," only for her to lose two Bitcoins when it collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:11">[01:29:11]</a>. This personal anecdote underscores the inherent risks and unpredictability, even for experienced participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

He predicts that similar "mega deleveraging events" and company blow-ups will continue to occur, potentially at even larger scales than the $10-$50 billion losses seen in the previous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>. This is attributed to inherent human greed and the still-undeveloped regulatory frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:35">[01:26:35]</a>. The source of the next major blow-up is likely to be unexpected, as was the case with DeFi Summer, meme coins, or the failures of Luna and FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>.

## Building a Right System and Learning Lessons

Daryl admits to breaking his own rules more often than he'd like, consistently losing money when he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. He conducts "trading reflections" after significant moves to identify mistakes and reinforce adherence to his established rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>.

### Avoiding Desperation
He cautions against setting rigid financial goals (e.g., "$2 million by the end of the year") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:41">[01:50:41]</a>. Such fixation can lead to desperation and poor [[decision_making_and_market_success_in_crypto_investing | decision-making]], especially late in a market cycle, which often results in significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:58">[01:50:58]</a>. Instead, the advice is to "dance while the music plays, but don't be fixated on any one number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

### Importance of Teams
Working as a team, or at least having a trusted group of friends, is crucial in crypto. No single person can cover everything happening in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. A team allows for sharing of information, challenging biases, and providing support, especially when individuals are emotionally "on tilt" and prone to making compounding bad decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>. This external accountability can mitigate what is often called "revenge trading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>.

For newcomers, the first cycle should focus on [[building_trust_and_value_in_the_crypto_space_through_experiments_and_experience | building the right connections]] and learning crucial lessons, including failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. The second cycle is where individuals can truly capitalize on their newfound understanding, edge, and network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:58">[01:33:58]</a>. Key qualities sought in team members include strong ethics, hunger, and sharpness, though sharpness can be developed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a>.

The discourse around [[the_role_of_decentralization_in_blockchain_security | decentralization]] and centralization is central to the evolution of crypto platforms. Jesse Pollak, creator of Base, discusses the inherent tension and strategic balance required for building a global on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

## The Mission: Building a Global On-Chain Economy
The overarching mission for Base is to build a global on-chain economy that enhances innovation, creativity, and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This new system aims to upgrade existing economic models that are often decades or even centuries old and are perceived as failing due to being expensive, slow, frustrating, or discriminatory based on location or access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

The goal is to create a "global app store" where developers can build on an open platform, creators can monetize their content directly, and users worldwide have equal access to applications, regardless of their location or device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional, centralized app stores where corporations take a significant percentage of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

## Centralization Challenges in Legacy Systems
Existing economic and online systems often present significant challenges:
*   **High Costs and Slow Transactions**: Traditional financial systems are expensive and slow, impacting everyday people and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. For example, international remittances can incur significant fees, such as $42-$45 to send money from Mexico to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.
*   **Unfairness for Creators**: Creators on centralized platforms often earn minimal revenue compared to the billions taken by the platforms themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Discriminatory Access**: Access to financial products and apps can vary drastically based on a user's location or phone type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## The Paradox of Coinbase and Base
Coinbase, a NASDAQ-listed and regulated centralized crypto company, launched Base, a [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_decentralized_exchanges | decentralized]] Ethereum Layer 2 network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. This situation presents an "inherent tension" between centralization and [[the_concept_of_decentralized_finance_and_its_evolution | decentralization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

### Strengths of Centralized Incubation
*   **First Customer Advantage**: Coinbase serves as an "incredible first customer" for Base, allowing the platform to solve complex problems for a large, public company, which can then serve as a playbook for other Fortune 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Resources**: Base benefits from Coinbase's distribution, efficiency, scale, and resources, enabling aggressive growth and proliferation of new building methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
*   **Founding Leadership**: The belief and commitment from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who deeply understands crypto, is crucial. Armstrong emphasizes the need to [[the_role_of_decentralization_in_blockchain_security | decentralize]] Base, warning that failure to do so would render all efforts wasteful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

### Risks and Challenges of Centralization
*   **Loss of Decentralized Vision**: The primary risk is getting "lost in the sauce of centralization," leading to the platform being perceived merely as a traditional corporate product rather than an open, global on-chain economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
*   **Trust Issues**: Centralized entities like Facebook (with Libra) have faced significant trust issues in the past, and a similar skepticism can arise if a centralized company is seen as controlling a purportedly decentralized platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.

> "An open global on-chain economy is not going to be controlled by one company, it's not going to be controlled by one country, it has to be decentralized because that's the only way you can actually get the level of neutrality in the system that would make it so every country could participate and so every corporation could participate every person regardless of where they're born could participate." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>

## Base's Approach to Decentralization
Base is built as an Ethereum L2 and on the OP Stack, meaning every contribution is open-source, bootstrapping off Ethereum's [[the_role_of_decentralization_in_blockchain_security | decentralization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. The project focuses on delivering decentralization milestones, such as launching fault proofs on testnet and making progress on a security council for multi-proof in stage two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

## Focus on Products, Not Just Tokens
A significant criticism within the crypto space is the tendency to prioritize tokens and economic incentives over building valuable products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Pollak believes that the success of projects like Base, Polymarket, and Pump.fun, despite not having tokens, demonstrates the importance of focusing on product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

> "People have put the token ahead of the product... literally it's incredibly toxic and incredibly negative for actually making great products." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>

The emphasis should be on building user-friendly products that are "better than every online product that exists today" to encourage widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

## Future of On-Chain Systems
Pollak predicts a rapid shift where on-chain systems will "eat the internet," leading to billions of people using on-chain applications within the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This rapid adoption is possible because the underlying internet infrastructure is already in place, making it a software update rather than a hardware deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a>.

The next 12 months are expected to see the various components of the on-chain ecosystem—low-cost L2s, smart wallets, and on-chain identities (like Base Names)—seamlessly integrated. This will create a powerful, easy-to-use experience for both developers and users, offering a 10x improvement over existing online products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:25">[01:26:25]</a>.

David Shin, a leader at Immutable X, is actively shaping digital asset policies and advising central banks. His journey into the world of cryptocurrency began in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Early Experiences with Bitcoin

In February 2012, David Shin was introduced to Bitcoin by a friend who worked at another bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Upon hearing about it, he Googled it and found only the white paper, which he read that night, unable to sleep due to its implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Shin was one of the first individuals to attempt [[first_experiences_and_challenges_in_cryptocurrency | ASIC mining]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. A significant challenge in the early days was that many ASIC chips were pre-funded but could not be delivered, despite payments being taken upfront in Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Recovering these payments through civil courts in the U.S. was very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

By 2013, Shin became involved with Ripple, viewing it as a prime technology platform to disrupt the centralized Swift network for cross-border payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He was one of the first bankers to openly discuss Bitcoin and blockchain's potential impact on systems like Swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Role in Financial Systems

David Shin believes that Bitcoin, and blockchain technology in general, can significantly [[evolution_of_cryptocurrency_infrastructure | impact cross-border payments]] by offering a decentralized alternative to traditional systems like Swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### The Swift Network
The Swift network is a consortium of banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. While not highly profitable from payment transfers directly due to high maintenance costs for infrastructure like data centers, it generates margin by setting rules that prioritize global banks over regional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This prioritization creates latency in cross-border transfers (e.g., three to five business days from Singapore to the U.S.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This latency allows banks to create short-term pools of funds, which they can lend to each other in the interbank lending market, influencing rates like LIBOR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Shin argues that banks, while providing useful services like facilitating money transfers, make money by taking deposits and using them for lending, which creates credit markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He questions whether banks should operate as commercial institutions that take significant risks, leading to bubbles, or as utility companies that add value without excessive risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. He asserts that deposit money should be held in custody and not used for speculative secondary markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Broader Impact and Geopolitics

Shin sees Bitcoin and blockchain technology as being at the forefront of changing how countries trade and operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.

### The Declining U.S. Dollar
Shin predicts that the U.S. dollar will cease to be the global intermediary currency for settling trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. He notes a trend of countries de-dollarizing, starting with Iran and Russia, and even the EU choosing to de-dollarize to buy Iranian oil directly despite U.S. sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) are working to create an alternative trading system that bypasses Swift and the U.S. dollar, likely utilizing a blockchain-based digital currency or stablecoin for settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. This move is significant because the U.S. economy's growth often relies on printing more dollars, which is justified by wars, and the global demand for the dollar would sink if other countries decouple from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>.

Shin believes this shift will accelerate if China acts against Taiwan, triggering sanctions from the West. China, having prepared for such sanctions through "dry runs" like the extended COVID lockdowns in Shanghai, is ready to pivot away from the U.S. dollar, potentially using its e-RMB and direct swaps with BRICS nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. This would create a domino effect, leading other trading partners to move away from the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>.

### Africa's Role
Africa is seen as a major benefactor of this geopolitical shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:28">[01:19:28]</a>. It is the most geopolitically neutral continent, unlike regions like India or Europe, which are exposed to or aligned with either Western or Eastern powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>. Africa also possesses over 30% of the world's resources and 60% of its arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>. As the world moves away from globalization and potentially faces challenges with supply chains, food, and minerals, Africa is poised to become a key marketplace for global resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>. The African Union's structure allows its member countries to maintain political neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>.

### Perception of Bitcoin and Crypto Investment
David Shin notes that the "crypto native guys" often do not care about the work Ripple is doing with banks and regulators, which leads to a perception that "nothing is happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>. He suggests that newcomers to crypto often gravitate towards projects based on "cult of personalities" rather than sound engineering or clear ideology, citing Cardano as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. He also emphasizes the [[benefits_and_challenges_of_bitcoin_etfs | impact of technological advancements and market patterns on crypto investments]], highlighting that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs will likely increase institutional interest, leading to the tokenization of other real-world assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. This represents an [[economic_layer_for_bitcoin | economic layer for Bitcoin]] that ties it more closely with traditional finance.

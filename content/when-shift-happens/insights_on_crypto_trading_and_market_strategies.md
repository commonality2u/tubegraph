Lou Reges, founder and CEO at xborg, shares his perspectives on the crypto market, drawing from his experience as a trader and builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>. He emphasizes that crypto is "100% crypto" in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, highlighting its consuming nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Journey into Crypto Trading

Reges entered the crypto space around 2017 to 2021 as a trader and participant in meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. He then transitioned to the builder side in 2022 with xborg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. His background in finance, stemming from his university studies, contributed to his desire to understand financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. He believes that [[decision_making_and_market_success_in_crypto_investing | financial freedom]] allows individuals to avoid being bound to a traditional 9-to-5 job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

## Making Money Trading Crypto

According to Reges, [[investment_strategies_in_the_crypto_market | making money trading in crypto]] requires understanding who leads narratives and how capital flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. He notes that most people entering crypto trading with the hope of escaping their 9-to-5 rarely succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

To succeed in crypto trading, one must:
*   **Experience losses and remain humble:** Losing money is a necessary step to understand the market's volatility and the potential for losing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
*   **Understand market narratives and capital flow:** Influencers on platforms like Crypto Twitter often direct the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. Capital flow is often dictated by events, such as AI tokens performing well around Nvidia earnings or gaming tokens surging before the GDC conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.
*   **Identify market asymmetries:** There are exceptional opportunities in the market for those who understand its intricacies and the flow of capital, providing an "edge" for significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

Reges focuses on big narratives and catalysts to understand where capital will flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>. He emphasizes that money moves in specific sectors, such as AI, meme coins, NFTs, and gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>. His strategy involves checking what people are discussing on Telegram, Discord, and Twitter for 10-15 minutes each morning to gauge market rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>.

## The Role of Exchanges in Crypto Economics

Reges expresses disappointment in how crypto exchanges operate, noting that they hold significant leverage over projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Tokenomics Manipulation:** Most token economics online are guided by exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:00">[49:00:00]</a>. For example, the common requirement for initial token launches to have a low circulating supply (e.g., 5-10%) is mandated by exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:24:00">[49:24:00]</a>. This strategy aims to ensure the token performs well initially, as lower supply leads to higher buy pressure than sell pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:48:00">[49:48:00]</a>.
*   **Influence and Connections:** Getting listed on major exchanges often depends on personal connections rather than just metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:00">[51:02:00]</a>. A small group of people (around 10) within the top 3-5 exchanges control most of the liquidity and have the power to influence listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:11:00">[53:11:00]</a>.

## Meme Coins: A Market Indicator

Reges holds a lot of respect for meme coins, citing his best trade ever being on Shib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:15]</a>.
*   **Retail Empowerment:** Meme coins are seen as a movement where retail investors can win, challenging the traditional VC setup where early investors and teams often profit most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>. He calls them "the people's coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Angle:** Meme coins are often viewed as unlikely to be qualified as securities by regulatory bodies like the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. Dogecoin, for example, has a high likelihood of getting an ETF due to lacking an initial token offering, which makes it harder to classify as a security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>.
*   **Risk-On Index:** Meme coins serve as an index for market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. If meme coins are rising, it indicates that the market is willing to take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>.
*   **Simplicity and Appeal:** Crypto is inherently complex, and many retail investors don't understand advanced concepts like ZK infra or parallel EVMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>. Meme coins offer a simpler, more engaging investment opportunity, akin to gambling or playing the lottery, which appeals to a broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>. Historically, meme coins have provided the best returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>.

## Investment Strategies: Primary vs. Secondary Markets

### Primary Markets
Primary markets refer to investments made before a token generation event (TGE), typically in pre-seed, seed, or Series A funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>. These often involve a combination of token and equity investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>.
*   **High Returns:** This is where "big money" is made, with the potential for "insane multiples" if one invests wisely during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>. Early investors in projects launching on Binance have seen returns of up to 100x by the time of launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.
*   **Risks for Retail:** Retail investors often get "wrecked" when early investors, whose tokens are vested and unlocked, dump their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:03:00">[27:03:00]</a>.
*   **Long Time Horizon:** Primary market investments typically have a 3-4 year vesting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:05:00">[28:05:00]</a>.
*   **Bear Market Opportunities:** The best deals in primary markets are found in the depths of bear markets (e.g., 2022, early 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32:00">[28:32:00]</a>. Getting in early allows for selling claims or OTC deals before full vesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:00">[28:48:00]</a>.

### Secondary Markets
Secondary markets involve trading tokens after they have been launched to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>. Raising a liquid fund (focused on secondary markets) is more appealing during bull markets because of the shorter time horizon compared to primary market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:09:00">[29:09:00]</a>. Achieving 100x returns in secondary markets from a $1 million placement is substantially harder than in primary markets due to liquidity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>.

## The Psychological Toll of Crypto Trading

Leverage trading can be extremely consuming and detrimental to personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>.
*   **Constant Anxiety:** Traders may experience intense anxiety, such as panic when Wi-Fi isn't available on a plane due to open positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28:00">[33:28:00]</a>. Reges recounted a personal experience where his portfolio dropped 30% in 10 minutes while he was expecting a massage, leading to panic and feeling ashamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>.
*   **Humility:** The market can take everything away at any moment, emphasizing the need for humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. Reges mentions a friend who lost $120 million due to a deleveraging event while cross-margined on Bybit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:00">[36:54:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Management:** Reges now adopts a "risk-off" profile, primarily focusing on spot positions and using leverage only when the market is "tremendously down" and not over-leveraged (e.g., low funding rates, low open interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:49:00">[37:49:00]</a>. His strategy involves holding a perpetuals position equal to his spot position (1:1 ratio) to increase market exposure by 100% without direct liquidation risk unless a major event occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>.

## Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) and Market Influence

The KOL landscape is highly aggressive in April 2024, with projects like xborg experiencing significant oversubscription for KOL rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:27:00">[54:27:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Conviction:** Many KOLs invest based on who else has invested, not on strong personal conviction in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>. This creates a "herd mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:04:00">[55:04:00]</a>.
*   **Behind-the-Scenes Influence:** KOLs often operate in conglomerates, discussing projects and collectively deciding to "pump" or "FUD" (spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt) a token, which directly impacts its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:49:00">[55:49:00]</a>.
*   **Preferential Treatment:** Larger KOLs often receive better terms or discounts on allocations compared to smaller KOLs or even some VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:41:00">[56:41:00]</a>.

## Future Market Predictions (Next 12 Months)
Reges's [[insights_on_crypto_and_technological_advances | predictions for the next 12 months]] include:
*   **Meme Coins:** Meme coins are expected to continue performing well, with some projects potentially reaching 30 billion FDV (fully diluted valuation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:32:00">[58:32:00]</a>. If the market remains risk-on, a 10x surge is possible for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:03:00">[59:03:03]</a>.
*   **KOL Reset:** A major reset is anticipated in the KOL landscape due to excessive activity and inflated offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:12:00">[59:12:00]</a>.
*   **AI Tokens:** AI tokens are predicted to do exceptionally well, with projects like Ether, IO.net, Render, and Injective expected to perform strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:23:00">[59:23:00]</a>.
*   **TON Blockchain:** The TON blockchain is likely to become one of the biggest blockchains, potentially front-running the next BSC-like ecosystem due to Telegram's 900 million users worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This offers a massive user base and a direct connection to the crypto community, as most crypto users are on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

The wine industry, particularly the market for [[investment_grade_wine_as_an_asset_class | investment grade wine]], is a significant asset class valued at $250 billion, with $10 billion in annual turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite its impressive 1,000% return over the last 20 years, outperforming gold, accessing and investing in this market is notoriously difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. David Garrett, co-founder and CEO of Divin Labs, notes that while investing $100,000 in stocks, bonds, or gold might take minutes, the same investment in fine wine could take over a week due to market opacity and a lack of transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Divin aims to introduce [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | blockchain technology]] to the wine industry, transforming luxury and investment-grade wine from a possession into an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Challenges in the Traditional Wine Industry
The traditional wine industry faces several structural challenges:

*   **Market Inaccessibility & Opacity**
    The fine wine market is largely controlled by older generations and is characterized by a lack of price transparency and discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. It's difficult to enter the market and almost impossible to buy or sell wine intelligently without an established network of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. This contrasts sharply with other asset classes like stocks, bonds, or gold, which can be invested in quickly through digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.

*   **Lack of Consumer Connectivity**
    Wine producers often have little connection with the end consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. A bottle consumed today was likely made 10 years ago by someone thousands of miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. This temporal and spatial disconnect makes it difficult for wine makers to:
    *   **Get Feedback for Product Development:** Unlike most modern products, wine makers receive feedback years after production, hindering rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. Platforms like Vivino, while popular, don't provide useful feedback due to misaligned incentives that reward extreme reviews over genuine insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.
    *   **Optimize Supply Chain:** The significant delay between purchase and consumption (often 10 years for fine wine) means wine makers lack data on where and when their products are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. This leads to inefficient supply chain distribution, especially for producers with limited product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
    *   **Acquire and Retain Customers:** Traditional advertising channels are severely restricted for luxury wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. This makes it challenging to acquire loyal customers who understand the brand story and repeatedly purchase their wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.

*   **Gatekeepers and Risk Allocation**
    The industry relies heavily on middlemen, particularly the *Place de Bordeaux* and *negociants* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. While these entities have historically provided value by building distribution networks, they take an outsized share of revenue with relatively little risk, often buying and selling wine on credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. The true financial and labor risk (blood, sweat, and tears over 10 years) is borne by the wine makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

*   **Regulatory Scarcity**
    Regulations in regions like Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Napa limit the planting of new vines or specific varietals, contributing to artificial scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>. This regulatory regime, often influenced by collectives of existing wineries, protects brand status but restricts overall supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

## Divin's [[Web3 and the Tokenization of Wine Industry | Blockchain Solution]]
Divin (decentralized wine) is building the operating system for the wine industry by leveraging [[blockchain_and_crypto_innovation | blockchain technology]] to solve these fundamental problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Turning Wine into an Asset
Divin creates a "digital deed of ownership" or "digital product passport" for each bottle of luxury or investment-grade wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. This "digital cork" provides:
*   **Chain of Ownership and Custody:** Tracking the bottle's journey from producer to consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.
*   **Anti-Fraud and Anti-Counterfeit Protections:** Ensuring authenticity and preventing fraudulent bottles from entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
*   **Provenance:** Detailed history and origin information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.

By providing these verifiable attributes, Divin transforms wine from a mere possession into a transparent, liquid asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. This enables features common to other asset classes, such as insurance, borrowing against collections, and clear price transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.

### Connecting Wine Makers and Wine Lovers
Divin introduces a unique mechanism for wine, an asset that is eventually consumed and destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>. When a consumer opens and drinks a bottle, they can easily "destroy" the digital cork with their phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>. In return, they receive a "tasting token," an authentic proof of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>. This mechanism powers a loyalty program:

*   **VIN Coin:** Launched on Solana, VIN Coin acts as "air miles for wine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. Wine makers attach VIN Coin to bottles, which are claimed by consumers upon opening, sending consumption data back to the producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.
*   **Benefits for Wine Makers:**
    *   **Consumption Data:** Real-time data on where and when bottles are consumed for product development and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
    *   **Supply Chain Optimization:** Improved efficiency in distribution based on consumption patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>.
    *   **Customer Acquisition:** Direct connection to consumers, enabling targeted rewards, offers, and loyalty programs (e.g., "premier cru" membership, access to exclusive tastings or drops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.
*   **Benefits for Consumers:**
    *   **Rewards and Status:** Access to exclusive experiences, events, and loyalty benefits from wineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.
    *   **Utility:** VIN Coin can be used to purchase more wine, unique experiences (e.g., winery tours, harvest experiences), or exchanged with other luxury brands interested in high-end wine consumers (e.g., Rolls-Royce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. VIN Coin will also be tradable on exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

This system creates a closed feedback loop that provides valuable [[the_role_of_data_in_wine_production_and_distribution | data]] to wine makers, empowering them to grow their businesses in ways previously impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

### Improving Liquidity and Access
By creating a digital deed of ownership, Divin enables precise tracking of available bottles for any given vintage, allowing for more accurate pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. This global price transparency and discovery will bring significant liquidity into the marketplace, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors, especially younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. Wine can become an attractive investment for those priced out of real estate or skeptical of traditional stock markets, offering an experiential asset class where individual research can yield asymmetrical information advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>.

## David Garrett's Journey and [[vision_and_innovation_in_blockchain_technology | Vision]]
David Garrett's journey into wine and [[blockchain_and_coordination | blockchain]] began after selling his first tech company, which built the intranet for the US Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. After realizing he wasn't adding "real value to the world" through his tech work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>, he dedicated his life to experiencing things and exploring the world, building businesses in six countries and visiting over 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. His decision to start a vineyard in Argentina was spurred by an economic crisis that made land affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>.

Recognizing the long lead times in wine production (up to 10 years from planting to sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, Garrett applied a Silicon Valley mindset to wine, prioritizing distribution from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. He built an information center and tasting room in Mendoza to collect customer data and establish a wine club, creating a distribution network before his own wine was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

He also addressed the wine industry's lack of [[the_role_of_data_in_wine_production_and_distribution | data]] by systematically collecting granular information on successful vineyards and wine-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. This data-driven approach, unusual in the intuitive wine world, allowed them to de-risk wine making and achieve high "take rates" (successful vine plantings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

Garrett's [[vision_and_innovation_in_blockchain_technology | vision]] for Divin is long-term, focusing on building tools that will be used by future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>. He believes that the industry must adapt to the changing expectations of [[cultural_and_generational_shifts_in_wine_consumption | digitally native consumers]] who demand transparency, experiences over possessions, and direct connections with brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:14">[00:56:14]</a>. He predicts a significant "step change" in crypto adoption in the next 12-18 months, where mainstream users will participate in functional blockchain projects without needing to understand underlying complexities like wallets or NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Divin aims to be part of this shift, abstracting the blockchain away while providing tangible value for wine lovers and makers alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.

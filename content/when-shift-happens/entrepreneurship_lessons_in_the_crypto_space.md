## Soo: A Web2.5 Platform
Irene Xiao, one of the most influential women in crypto, founded Soo, a web2.5 social platform designed to help creators launch NFT collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>. Soo aims to bridge web2 (traditional internet applications like Instagram and Twitter) and web3 (blockchain-based platforms like NFTs) by simplifying the creation of NFTs for web2 creators and a mass audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:15">[03:22:15]</a>. The primary challenge identified is the intimidating user interface of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:49">[03:47:49]</a>.

## Reality of Entrepreneurship and Money Management
Starting a company is not about freedom; it involves significant mental strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>. Having money can attract unexpected problems, and it's challenging to retain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:46">[02:45:46]</a>. As a business grows, so do its problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:38">[02:54:38]</a>.

### Key Lessons on Business Management:
*   **Stay Lean Initially:** Entrepreneurs should build a very lean team at the start and avoid trying to assemble an "all-star" or "five-star" team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. Even with the best people, they may not contribute much if the team expands too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.
*   **Delayed Expansion:** It's advisable to start as late as possible and not expand quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:59">[03:00:59]</a>.
*   **Resource Management:** Even with significant funding, focus on making the best use of existing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:42">[03:08:42]</a>. A mindset of longevity (e.g., being able to survive for 10 years without making money) is beneficial over immediate rapid expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:57">[03:33:57]</a>.
*   **Market Timing:** Rapid expansion is appropriate during a bull market to capitalize on hype, but precise timing is crucial to avoid wasteful spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:38">[02:54:38]</a>.
*   **Controlling FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):** It's essential to control FOMO, especially when deciding whether to build new functions or chase market hype. A delay in execution means you might miss the trend, as seen with Farcaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:21">[03:01:21]</a>. Trusting one's instinct rather than just having money to invest is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:21">[03:01:21]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Persistence and Mental Strength
The journey of building a business is hard, but it significantly builds mental toughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:01">[03:08:01]</a>. Criticism, especially as a woman in the public eye, is common, but developing tolerance to stress is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:01">[03:08:01]</a>.

### Key Learnings on Mental Fortitude:
*   **Dealing with Criticism:** Early in her career, Irene cried over online criticism, including being mistaken for a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:06">[03:15:06]</a>. An experienced entrepreneur advised her that she was "mentally weak" and not ready for entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>. However, through experience, one learns not to care about such criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Normalizing Failure:** It's unlikely for an entrepreneur to be super successful in their very first venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>. Most mega-successful entrepreneurs have built multiple companies before finding massive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:32">[03:38:32]</a>. Failure should be normalized, as should founders who have "rocked" (failed) before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:10">[03:39:10]</a>.
*   **Perseverance:** [[entrepreneurial_persistence_and_success_in_crypto | Entrepreneurial Persistence and Success in Crypto]] is about trying something that makes sense, and even if it doesn't immediately resonate with others, not stopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>. Success often comes from continuous pivoting and trying different approaches over a long period, potentially up to 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:14">[04:01:14]</a>.
*   **Ego Management:** In business, it's crucial to have zero ego when dealing with customers, investors, or people in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:59">[03:31:59]</a>. Taking things personally or being mentally affected by criticisms hinders growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>.

## Navigating External Perceptions and "Pretty Privilege"
The reputation that female influencers make money just for being pretty is acknowledged, with beauty being considered an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:13">[03:52:13]</a>. However, maintaining this asset requires significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:13">[03:52:13]</a>.

### Strategies for leveraging "Pretty Privilege":
*   **Strategic Use of Assets:** If one possesses the asset of beauty and knows how to use it strategically without people getting bored, it demonstrates smartness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:32">[03:57:32]</a>.
*   **Changing Perception:** Initial perceptions of relying solely on looks can change as an individual achieves greater success, leading people to recognize their intelligence and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:06">[04:15:06]</a>.
*   **Transactional Relationships:** Being pretty can make it easier to approach people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:01">[04:49:01]</a>. The challenge then lies in developing superficial relationships into more concrete ones based on strength, communication skills, and what one can offer beyond superficiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:58">[04:56:58]</a>. The focus should be on achieving one's goals, regardless of how others perceive you, especially when dealing with those with more resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:34">[04:45:34]</a>.

## Trading vs. Building in Crypto
Both Irene and the interviewer shared their negative experiences with leverage trading, highlighting the mental toll and financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:45">[05:23:45]</a>.

### Lessons from Trading:
*   **High Risk of Leverage:** Leverage trading can lead to rapid gains and losses, often resulting in liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:08">[05:29:08]</a>.
*   **Market Volatility:** Bitcoin and Ethereum can experience significant price drops (e.g., 50-70% in a day or week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Exchange Advantage:** Exchanges often benefit from liquidating both long and short positions during volatile periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:24">[12:51:24]</a>.
*   **Illusion of Leverage:** Leverage trading can be an illusion, and stop losses don't always work as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:02">[12:59:02]</a>.
*   **Mental Toll:** Trading 24/7 is mentally exhausting and can lead to constant worry about positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:06">[13:36:06]</a>. It can consume personal life and mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:11">[16:50:11]</a>.
*   **Spot Holding is Safer:** Ultimately, holding spot assets (not leveraged) is often recommended as a more stable approach to crypto investment than active trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:02">[13:31:02]</a>.
*   **Internet Misrepresentation:** People on the internet primarily share their gains, not their losses, creating a misleading perception of easy money in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:04">[14:28:04]</a>.
*   **Developing Strategy:** Successful traders often develop a "gut feeling" and prioritize limiting losses with strategies like stop-loss orders and predefined loss limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:13">[15:39:13]</a>.

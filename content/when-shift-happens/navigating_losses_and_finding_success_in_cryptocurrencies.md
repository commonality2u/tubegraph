Ray Chan, co-founder and CEO of 9GAG and co-founder of Memeland, shares insights on enduring challenges, learning from setbacks, and finding success in both personal life and the cryptocurrency space.

## Embracing Challenges and Learning from Experience

Ray Chan believes that people have different advantages at different life stages, but starting a company allows one to choose a category where they have an "unfair advantage" and continue to learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. He highlights that while young people have a low cost of opportunity and more time to try new things, older individuals gain connections, experience, and better people skills, which are crucial for managing teams and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

### The "Boome" Advantage in Crypto
In the fast-paced crypto industry, Ray, who refers to himself as a "boomer," acknowledges that younger colleagues are better suited to keep up with the hundreds or thousands of new projects and constant trends due to their capacity to "absorb a lot of stuff" and engage in Discord and Telegram groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. However, he believes a "smart Boomer" brings different advantages like experience and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Mindset: Quitting vs. Persistence

When discussing the saying "winners never quit," Ray clarifies that it's more about a mentality than literal persistence with a single product. He states that winning involves learning when to exit a specific product or feature while continuing the broader mission of problem-solving and creating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.

> "Winners don't quit when you talk about okay, this is like a, as you mentioned, it's like a macro lens where okay, oh, I love solving problems, I love creating a products, I love like kind like working with people, right, starting companies, right? I think on a category level right, actually those guys even if they shut down their existing company, they don't quit." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:29]</a>

He attributes 9GAG's 16 years of success to "constant shipping" and focusing on daily satisfaction for users, highlighting that "overnight success" stories often mask years of "blood and tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:00">[40:54:00]</a>. Hard work is a prerequisite for building companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:50:00">[42:50:00]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy on Dealing with Losses

Ray openly shares his experience of losing his first son five years ago, viewing death not as the ultimate end but as a natural part of life that should be discussed more openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[28:04:00]</a>. He emphasizes that confronting such a profound loss provides perspective, making business failures or financial setbacks seem less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[31:27:00]</a>.

> "Greatness doesn't come from abilities, greatness comes from character and character comes from suffering." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>

He stresses the importance of treasuring time and loved ones, as time is the most scarce resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>. Ray encourages a proactive mindset, believing that "it all shall pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a> and that complaining only makes one feel powerless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>.

## Navigating Losses in Crypto

Ray's "aha moment" in crypto came about three to four years ago, when he realized the efficiency of blockchain technology for transferring funds compared to traditional banking, which can take days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:31:00">[46:31:00]</a>. Although initially skeptical of NFTs, he decided to "pay to learn" by investing significantly, incurring "expensive life lessons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:17:00">[56:17:00]</a>.

### Learning from Experience
He advocates for "skin in the game" to learn faster, emphasizing that simply listening to podcasts or reading blogs only makes one a bystander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:14:00">[57:14:00]</a>. He encourages action, even if it means getting "wrecked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:56:00">[55:56:00]</a>.

### Avoiding Regret and Finding New Opportunities
Ray advises against dwelling on missed opportunities, such as not buying Bitcoin or Ethereum earlier, and instead focusing on the abundance of new opportunities in Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:53:00">[48:53:00]</a>.

> "There's so many opportunities that you're going to miss a lot, but you're always going to have another shot, always. Therefore it's not I missed Ethereum or I missed Bitcoin at this price, it's hey like you're going to have so many other opportunities, you just need to stick around and in the context of crypto not die meaning not lose all your money at once right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:02:00">[50:02:00]</a>

His personal experience with loss has shaped his perspective, allowing him to view challenges through a lens of learning and growth, turning misfortunes into opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Ray is bullish on the future of Web3 and believes it will achieve mass adoption by becoming simpler and more accessible to people, rather than requiring them to "onboard" by learning complex concepts like seed phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. He sees cryptocurrency as a disruptive technology that forces traditional institutions to change, ultimately leading to a better life for human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. He emphasizes embracing change as the only constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Memeland's Vision
Ray's ultimate vision for Memeland is to become the company that "brings Web3 to the people," much like 9GAG brought memes to the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. Memeland aims to leverage NFTs for community building and tokens for value distribution, creating a "community company" where people can have fun and potentially make money together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:03:00">[58:03:00]</a>.

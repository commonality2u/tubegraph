The future of digital transactions and identity hinges on wallets working together to avoid monopolies [00:00:00]. Pedro Gomez, the founder of [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]], an open-source protocol, is spearheading this mission [00:00:22]. [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]] securely connects users to decentralized applications, serving over 45 million users and powering more than 275 million connections [00:00:26].

## From Traditional Banking to Blockchain: A Journey of Disillusionment and Innovation

Pedro Gomez's journey into blockchain was shaped by his experiences in traditional finance, particularly with neo banks [02:26:14].

### Limitations of Neo Banks
Neo banks, while offering improved user interfaces and simpler experiences compared to traditional banks (e.g., Monzo, Revolut) [00:30:09], are fundamentally built on outdated infrastructure [00:27:33]. They often operate as "a bank in a bank," under the license of larger institutions, limiting their ability to innovate due to regulatory and established bank constraints [00:27:47]. Gomez recounts a project where a feature allowing friends to share a savings account for collective goals was ultimately stripped down to a basic savings account due to these limitations [00:28:06]. This experience led him to believe that neo banks merely served as interfaces for big banks, not truly revolutionizing finance [00:29:02].

### The Vision of Blockchain for Identity
Gomez discovered Ethereum, realizing its potential to allow anyone to build wallets capable of the innovative financial experiences he envisioned at the neo bank [00:29:28]. He quickly identified a major problem in the early Ethereum ecosystem: the lack of standardized communication between wallets and applications [00:30:30]. This fragmentation meant app developers had to choose which wallets to support, leading to potential monopolies based on mere naming conventions rather than true technological superiority [00:31:39].

The core idea behind blockchain's impact on identity is profound:
*   **Decentralized Identity:** Unlike traditional digital identities (email, Telegram, phone numbers) owned by corporations that can be shut down by external forces like sanctions, a blockchain address is truly owned by the individual [00:22:26].
*   **Financial Coupling:** Approximately 90% of a legal identity is tied to financial benefits such as taxes, salary, or investments [00:21:45]. If a blockchain address were directly linked to these financial aspects, it could become more important than a national passport [00:22:09].
*   **Scaling Trust:** Blockchains were invented to scale trust beyond borders and nations, creating "trust machines" that can achieve what was previously unscalable [00:11:26]. However, even blockchains cannot scale customer relationships, which is where wallets, as "customer relationships for blockchains," play a crucial role [00:11:57].

## [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]]: Mission and Evolution

[[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]] was created to solve the problem of fragmented wallet-app communication [00:32:54]. Its mission is to make wallets work together to prevent a future where one wallet monopolizes the market [00:00:00].

### What is [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]]?
[[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]] is an open-source protocol that connects wallets to everything, not just on-chain applications [00:24:20]. This allows wallets to connect to ATMs for cash withdrawals, digital art exhibitions, and even cars, breaking barriers of both wallet and application monopolies [00:24:44]. By ensuring no single wallet, blockchain, or [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]] itself controls user identity, it aims to create a more trustworthy environment for digital identity [00:25:35].

### The Paradox of Decentralization
Gomez emphasizes that decentralization, while a core ethos of blockchain, should not precede product-market fit [01:11:46]. Attempting to decentralize too early, like setting up a foundation for a product with only two wallets, can be counterproductive [01:12:11]. This phenomenon is referred to as "playing house" â€“ doing what the book says without focusing on building something people want [01:15:49].

Instead, decentralization should be driven by market demand and implemented gradually as the network grows [01:12:54]. [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]] initially became more centralized to find product-market fit and secure venture funding [01:13:00]. However, external pressures eventually forced a shift:
*   **Partner Demand:** By 2022-2023, partners increasingly viewed [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]] as a single point of failure, demanding decentralization to allow greater ownership and contribution to the public infrastructure [01:13:19].
*   **The Ukraine War:** This conflict highlighted the critical need for decentralization [01:18:23]. During the war, [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]] faced a "bad episode" where it was forced to sanction both Ukraine and Russia for two days, disrupting connections [01:19:22]. This event underscored that a single company should not have the power to disrupt service due to geopolitical events, reinforcing the need for a multi-party system [01:19:44].

The goal is to build an upgradeable network that can slowly decentralize as limits are reached, allowing for growth while maintaining flexibility [01:14:37].

## The Future of Digital Wallets and Identity

### Universal Login
The future of [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]] is focused on revolutionizing how people log in to the internet, aiming to build a universal login [01:21:26]. While Google, Facebook, and Apple have attempted this, it has never been truly executed [01:21:41]. With 50,000 applications and 600 wallets collaborating, [[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]] believes it can achieve this universal login for the internet [01:21:58].

### The Rise of Personal Brands
In the digital age, personal brands are increasingly outperforming corporate brands [00:50:08]. This trend is global and visible across industries, with leaders like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg heavily investing in their personal brands [00:50:40]. People are becoming disengaged with corporate brands and are more likely to choose products because they like the people behind them [00:51:17]. For founders, self-awareness is key to building an authentic personal brand that aligns with their personality and lifestyle [00:53:11].

### The Power of Stablecoins
Pedro Gomez predicts that [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency | stablecoins]] will completely dominate commerce in the next 12 months, happening faster than anticipated [01:30:52].
*   **Efficiency:** [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency | Stablecoins]] offer unparalleled efficiency in payments [01:31:27]. Examples include Robinhood settling internal accounting with [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency | stablecoins]] and Stripe accepting crypto payments via [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency | stablecoins]] in its SDKs [01:31:30].
*   **Real-world Adoption:** Businesses are experiencing the benefits firsthand, noting the immediacy of [[Innovations in digital payments and cryptocurrency | stablecoin]] payments compared to traditional bank transfers [01:32:16]. For Gomez, receiving funds via USDC or USDT was a "beautiful" and more efficient experience than wire transfers during fundraising [01:34:26].

## [[Evolution of the cryptocurrency market and personal investment strategies | Investment Philosophy]] and Ecosystem Growth

Gomez's [[Evolution of the cryptocurrency market and personal investment strategies | investment strategy]] in the crypto space is primarily focused on "blue chip" assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana that have "survived and been battle-tested through winters" [00:35:19]. For other investments, he prioritizes betting on the founder (the "jockey") over the idea (the "horse") [00:35:57]. A strong founder can make even a "worst idea" successful [00:36:44]. He also cautions against founders having a venture capital (VC) role, believing it dilutes their energy from focusing on building the product [00:37:31].

### Ethereum's Complacency and Solana's Rise
Gomez, initially biased towards Ethereum as his entry point into crypto, acknowledges Ethereum's complacency [00:45:07]. He notes that Ethereum "took its position for granted," allowing Solana to seize opportunities [00:45:27]. Solana's ecosystem demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth after the FTX collapse, thriving by attracting new users and developers beyond the typical "crypto-native" demographic [00:46:23]. This ability to grow outside the existing blockchain user base signals significant potential and a need for the broader crypto community, including Ethereum-aligned individuals, to re-evaluate their strategies and allocate resources to emerging chains [00:48:48].

### Building Standards and Collaboration
Gomez advocates for building standards in parallel with products, even if it contradicts the traditional business approach of creating vendor lock-in and moats [01:25:40]. While this may hurt short-term gains, it fosters an open ecosystem beneficial for long-term growth [01:26:16].
[[The rise and impact of WalletConnect | WalletConnect]]'s Certified program exemplifies this, defining criteria for high-quality wallets to encourage better user experience patterns across the network without picking favorites [01:23:36]. This approach aims to foster coordination and incentivize the growth of the market as a whole, rather than companies competing to build monopolies [01:31:20].

He argues that the "open source philosophy" of building together, rather than individually capturing value, is crucial for reaching a billion users [01:28:40]. Founders must ask themselves if they truly have the capacity to capture a billion users alone through closed-source methods, or if collaboration and open standards are necessary for such ambitious goals [01:29:56].

Yield optimization in the crypto space involves strategies and protocols designed to maximize returns on digital assets. One such protocol, Nexus Protocol, aims to address significant challenges within the Terra ecosystem, particularly concerning liquidations during volatile market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Nexus Protocol: An Overview

Nexus Protocol, developed by Shimmy and Tundra, launched the v1 iteration of its vaults for the Terra Money community on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its core mission is to implement vaults that enable yield optimization and allow users to operate with a higher Total Value Locked (TVL) or collateral position than typically comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The protocol directly tackles the problem of liquidations, which can lead to massive impacts on portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A sequence of events earlier in the year caused significant liquidations in [[Role of Anchor Token in Yield Generation | Anchor Protocol]], leading to a nosedive in Luna's price and UST struggling to maintain its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Nexus Protocol mitigates this risk because its oracle "front-runs" the Anchor Protocol oracle, providing up-to-date pricing more quickly than Anchor itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This speed allows Nexus to optimize yields and loan-to-value rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

The governance token for Nexus Protocol is called PSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The protocol's website, nexusprotocol.app, provides access to its web application, where users can view the current PSI price, total value locked, and circulating supply details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Vaults and Liquidity Pools

As of midnight on the day of the video, Nexus Protocol's v1 vaults went live, offering bLuna (bonded Luna) and bETH (bonded ETH) options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Both bLuna and bETH originate from Anchor Protocol, where Luna can be bonded to get bLuna, and ETH or staked ETH can be bonded to get bETH for use across the Terra ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Nexus Protocol offers several liquidity pools for farming, including PSI-UST, nLuna-PSI, and nETH-PSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The nETH-PSI LP pool has been noted for offering the highest Annual Percentage Rate (APR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### How to Participate in Farming (Example: nETH-PSI Pool)

To participate in an nETH-PSI pool, users first need nETH, which is obtained by depositing bETH into a Nexus vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

1.  **Acquire bETH:** Users can purchase bETH directly on Terraswap using UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Buying bETH this way avoids the lock-up period typically associated with depositing into Anchor to get bETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Transaction fees on the Terra network are notably low, costing only a few cents for substantial swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
2.  **Deposit bETH into Nexus Vault:** Once bETH is acquired, it can be deposited into the Nexus Protocol vault. This action mints an equivalent amount of nETH, which is then used in liquidity pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
3.  **Farm nETH-PSI:** Navigate to the "Farm" tab on the Nexus Protocol app. Select the nETH-PSI pool and deposit nETH to begin farming. When depositing assets into a liquidity pool, an equal dollar value of both sides of the pool is required (e.g., 50% nETH, 50% PSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Withdrawing from Liquidity Pools

To withdraw liquidity, users can select the desired amount from the "Withdraw" tab on the farm page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. After withdrawing from the liquidity pool, the nETH can then be withdrawn from the vault, converting it back to bETH, which can then be sold back to UST or used as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Investment Strategies and Benefits

Nexus Protocol offers opportunities for [[Investment strategies and managing risk in crypto | passive income]] and growing PSI token holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. An [[Investment Strategies in Crypto Markets | investment strategy]] might involve splitting earned PSI tokens weekly, pairing them with other assets (like nETH or UST) to re-enter the liquidity pools, and thereby increasing exposure to high APR rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. While current APRs are incentivizing liquidity, the PSI-UST pool has historically maintained an APR around the 250% mark since its Token Generation Event (TGE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

The platform provides a frictionless and seamless experience in DeFi, aiming to deliver on its roadmap and allow users to avoid severe liquidations, which can significantly impact portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Governance

Beyond yield farming, users can also stake the Nexus governance token (PSI), though this feature is expected to go live soon with published APRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. As a governance token holder, users will have the ability to vote on polls regarding changes to vaults, additional liquidity pools, and other platform developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

Nexus Protocol is presented as a strong example of [[Yield in crypto vs capital gains | yield optimization in crypto]], offering solutions to significant problems like liquidations within the Terra ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Its user-friendly interface and focus on robust yield generation provide a promising platform for users seeking [[Bitcoin yield earning strategies | passive income]] and risk management in decentralized finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

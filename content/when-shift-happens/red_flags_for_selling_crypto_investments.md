Alex Felle, Chief Partnership Officer at SwissBorg, shares insights on identifying key "red flags" that signal it's time to sell crypto investments, drawing from his personal experiences and market observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Learning from Past Mistakes
Felle recounts his experience during the first altcoin cycle from 2016 to 2018, where he "got wrecked" by not selling and instead buying more on retracements, akin to "catching the falling knife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. This personal [[challenges_and_mistakes_in_crypto_investing | challenge]] led him to identify clear signals for future market exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

## Key Red Flags for Selling

### 1. Media Hype and Public Interest
A major red flag is when mainstream news and media begin to consistently feature Bitcoin or Ethereum hitting new all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>. This is particularly concerning when friends, family, or even taxi drivers, who previously showed no interest in fintech or crypto, start asking about buying Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. This indicates the "late majority" is entering the market, often a sign of a market top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

### 2. Excess Capital in Zero-Fundamental Projects
Another critical signal is an "excess of capital" flowing into projects with "zero fundamentals" or "garbage" underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. Examples from past cycles include:
*   **Dentacoin (2016-2018 Cycle)**: A project for dental X-rays on-chain, considered an "absolute crazy idea" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>.
*   **A Project Offering 100% APY per day (Third Altcoin Cycle)**: This project reached over a billion-dollar valuation despite its unsustainable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

When there's "too much capital flowing into the system" and numerous projects with "pure speculation at a unicorn status" (over $1 billion valuation) lacking solid fundamentals, it's a clear sign to exit immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>. This points to widespread [[spotting_crypto_scams_and_unsustainable_projects | unsustainable projects]] and euphoria.

## The Role of Psychology and Leverage
The biggest problem for an investor is their own [[the_psychology_behind_crypto_investments | psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>. Impatience and the desire for quick returns often lead to mistakes and significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.

Crypto cycles are characterized by a "pile of leverage piling up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>. People become "rich on paper" during these times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. However, sophisticated players recognize this paper wealth and strategically "break some things here and there to take the money out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>. This means if an investor doesn't realize their gains into cash or other tangible assets, "someone somewhere will take it away from you at some point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

A common psychological trap is the "I just need another 2x" mentality, which prevents investors from selling even after reaching their initial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>. The most challenging aspect of being a contrarian investor is fighting greed, as there's no historical data for new price territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. To combat this, one must set a goal and exit once that "life-changing amount" is reached, even if it feels painful to sell while prices continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

## Metrics for Determining When to Sell
To implement [[investment_strategies_and_managing_risk_in_crypto | risk management]] and successful selling, Felle highlights three core metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>:

1.  **Total Market Capitalization**: The overall value of the crypto market. If the previous cycle peaked at $3 trillion, a conservative estimate for the current cycle's peak might be $6 trillion (a 2x increase), with some forecasting up to $10 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. Investors should align their exit strategy with their [[investment_strategies_in_cryptocurrency | risk appetite]] based on these targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.
2.  **Single Asset All-Time High Capitalization**: The market cap of individual tokens. An asset is generally safer to buy when it's significantly below its previous all-time high, offering substantial upside (e.g., Solana at $8 or $10, with a 25x potential to its previous ATH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>. Anything above the previous all-time high becomes "very risky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>.
3.  **Time Component of the Cycle**: The "euphoria stages" or "markup stages" where parabolic growth occurs typically last between 6 to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. This often aligns with about 9 to 12 months after a Bitcoin Halving event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. It's often better to exit early than late, even if price targets haven't been fully met, if the time component indicates a peak is near <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. When seeing "double-digit gains... almost on a weekly basis" and charts going "parabolic," it's time to consider derisking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.

## Contrarian Investing
A key principle is [[investing_in_crypto_and_identifying_market_opportunities | contrarian investing]]: the best investors "do the opposite of what the majority will do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. For example, when hearing "the death of Solana" or "the death of Bitcoin" (as was the case for Solana post-FTX), it's often a signal to buy, especially if the fundamentals remain strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. The "fear" side of the market (all-time lows) is easier to navigate with data, but the "greed" side (new highs) is more challenging because there's no historical data to rely on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

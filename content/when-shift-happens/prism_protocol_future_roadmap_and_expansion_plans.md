Prism Protocol has a clear roadmap for its future development, focusing on expanding its functionalities and the range of assets it supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Prism V2 Roadmap

The roadmap for Prism V2 includes adding further utility to the Prism token itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Validators will be required to pledge Prism tokens as collateral if they wish to be considered for Luna delegation from the Prism vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The protocol will also adopt a methodology similar to v-Curve, meaning that staking Prism for a longer duration will grant more weight, voting rights, and voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Asset Expansion and Integration

Prism Protocol aims to support a wider array of assets and integrate with more protocols in the future:

### Proof-of-Stake Assets
The protocol plans to add support for more Proof-of-Stake assets beyond Luna, including:
*   Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>
*   Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>
*   Dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>

### Terra Ecosystem Assets
Within the [[introduction_to_prism_finance_and_its_impact_on_the_ecosystem | Terra ecosystem]], Prism intends to include native assets such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>:
*   UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
*   Mirror assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
*   Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
*   Mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>
*   Their respective LP tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>

### New Protocols and Bridging
Prism also plans to integrate assets created by many new protocols at launch, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>:
*   Money market protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>
*   DEXes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>
*   Protocol bridging for stablecoins like USDC, DAI, and Tether to Terra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>

## Overarching Goal

Ultimately, the end goal for Prism Protocol is to enable users to refract every yield-bearing asset possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This includes yield farms and LP tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Why Terra?
The choice of Terra for building these decentralized platforms is justified by several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>:
*   It is a truly decentralized algorithmic stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   Transaction fees are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   It offers fast transaction speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   With cross-chain platforms emerging, it is easily accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is considered the future, moving beyond centralized finance (CeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

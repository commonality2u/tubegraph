Despite recent price performance challenges, Ethereum (ETH) is positioned as a critical infrastructure for the future of financial markets, particularly due to its established ecosystem and technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges

In 2023, ETH experienced a significant downturn against both USD and Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This has led to concerns that [[ethereum_development_and_challenges | Ethereum]] might be "cooked" and its extensive ecosystem, including [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | layer 1]] and [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | layer 2]] solutions, could fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Some narratives suggest that alternative blockchains like Solana could overtake it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Infrastructure and Enterprise Adoption

A counter-narrative suggests that [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]] has simply "overbuilt capacity" for its current needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The core argument for [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]]'s resilience lies in its infrastructure:

*   **The [[the_role_of_the_ethereum_virtual_machine_evm_in_blockchain_development | EVM]] as an Industry Standard**: The [[the_role_of_the_ethereum_virtual_machine_evm_in_blockchain_development | Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)]] is compared to Microsoft in its prevalence among major enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Banks, insurance companies, and other large corporations tend to stick with established, working systems due to the high risk and difficulty of changing fundamental infrastructure once it's embedded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Lindy Effect**: [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]] has demonstrated its longevity and proven functionality, a concept known as the "Lindy effect," indicating its continued relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Suitability for Financial Markets**: [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]]'s design "clearly works very well for what the financial markets need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **[[The role of layer 2 solutions in scaling Ethereum | Layer 2 Solutions]]**: The platform supports [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | layer 2 solutions]] (e.g., as demonstrated by Coinbase), which can meet specific needs, while the main [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | layer 1]] chain offers high security for critical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Yield Generation**: ETH also offers a yield, making it an attractive product for financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Financial Institutions and Ethereum

Major financial players, such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, are highly unlikely to build their blockchain infrastructure on newer, less established platforms like Solana. Instead, they are expected to either build on [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]] or develop their own [[the_role_of_layer_2_solutions_in_scaling_ethereum | layer 2 solutions]] that interact with the [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Goldman Sachs has been involved in the crypto space since 2015 and is reportedly building on [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## The Evolving Narrative

Similar to Bitcoin's journey from a payment solution to a store of value, [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]] is expected to find a clearer, more defined narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The prevailing idea is that [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]] will solidify its identity as the "world computer" and the primary platform for tokenization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Price Performance and Outlook

While [[ethereums_performance_challenges_and_limitations | ETH's performance challenges and limitations]] are acknowledged, there is optimism that it will gain a new narrative in the current market cycle, potentially leading to a catch-up in price and even outperforming Bitcoin for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Over a five-year outlook, [[Ethereum and smart contracts | Ethereum]] is projected to remain incredibly important, assuming no major missteps in its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Ultimately, it is anticipated to emerge as a decentralized, global-scale compute platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

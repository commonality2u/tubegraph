In the evolving landscape of Web3 and cryptocurrency, the traditional marketing paradigm is being re-evaluated. Founders are increasingly recognizing that the product itself, along with its underlying values and community, serves as the most potent form of marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This perspective highlights a shift from conventional advertising to fostering genuine engagement and utility.

## The Community as the Business
Meow, co-founder of Jupiter Exchange, asserts that "the community is the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Similarly, Luca Netz, owner of Pudgy Penguins, states that the "toy business is really marketing to my community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This philosophy suggests that the core value lies in the strength and engagement of the user base, rather than solely in the product's sales figures.

Many founders believe that a strong community is paramount, yet few dedicate significant focus to it, often due to the demanding nature and additional work involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The community is seen as the "backbone" of the crypto business, enabling projects to move "10 times faster" when on their side, or leading to "tragic death" if not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Product as the Marketing Catalyst
The traditional approach in crypto often involves building a product and then using airdrops or other tactics for marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. However, a more effective strategy is to view the product itself as the primary marketing tool to attract and cultivate a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Meow explains that Jupiter's product, despite not always directly generating revenue, is designed to embody their ethos and serve as marketing for their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. They prioritize building a high-quality product, spending "enormous amount of times" on aspects like indexing, sorting, filtering, routing, designing, and scaling, even without immediate monetization, because the product is where their "ethos comes true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Luca applies this to Pudgy Penguins, noting that their toys, which are a product, serve as "marketing to my community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. He emphasizes that he didn't enter Web3 to solely sell toys, but rather to use the product as a vehicle for community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The product's content and "vibe" are crucial marketing elements that attract and reflect the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. It's about creating the "best possible product to reflect the community," rather than using a token or product simply to draw people in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This mindset, where "the product is the marketing," is considered crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Community as an Investment
Investing in community building, even when it appears as a "loss leader" on financial statements, is crucial for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Luca highlights that while the Web3 side of Pudgy Penguins incurs significant costs without direct royalty revenue, it forms the "nucleus" of the business. Investors value Pudgy Penguins at a higher multiple than its current earnings because of the "Revenue potential that comes from taking care of our community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This approach assumes that by enriching the community, value will be reciprocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

For a project to gain traction, developing a strong community and brand is essential, as competitors can replicate products but not loyal user bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
While the product-as-marketing approach is powerful, having a token can be "extremely distracting" for product focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. Jupiter intentionally built its platform for three to four years without a token to establish trust and a strong community before launching one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. A token should only be introduced when it synergizes with the community and product goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

### Key Elements for [[building_a_successful_crypto_community_and_marketing_strategy | Building a Successful Crypto Community]]
Key elements identified for [[building_a_successful_crypto_community_and_marketing_strategy | building a strong community]] include:
*   **Communication:** Being clear and consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Openness about operations and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.
*   **Empathy:** Understanding and validating community concerns, even if they seem trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. Many founders lack this, focusing too much on economics or technicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Sincerity/Genuineness:** Being authentic in interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
*   **Tactfulness:** Communicating thoughtfully, even when being sincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Non-extraction:** The community must believe that founders are "in it with them" and not extracting value without contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This builds goodwill, which is crucial for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. Jupiter, for example, committed to not selling founder tokens for a set period to demonstrate long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

Luca admits his weakest area might be empathy, as he sometimes struggles with understanding the depth of community concerns, even while maintaining professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>. Meow suggests his weakest point could be respectfulness, as sincerity can sometimes override tactfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.

### Competition and Adaptation
The crypto space is highly competitive, with "everyone is a competition" in the world of tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. When competitors do something well, it offers an opportunity to learn and co-exist, rather than viewing it purely as a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Meow describes a "schizophrenic" approach to competition, involving phases of paranoia, analysis, and eventually acceptance and even happiness, leading to learning and coexistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

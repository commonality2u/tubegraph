From: [[when-shift-happens]] <br/> 

Redacted operates as a Web3 incubator and accelerator, functioning as a singular entity that builds or co-builds a series of products in partnership with other teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. The company aims to provide end-to-end support, taking equity, revenue share, and tokens from the businesses they assist, without charging direct fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. Redacted has expanded to include over 14 products across various sectors like DeFi and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. Each product operates with its own dedicated team of 5 to 15 people, while Redacted maintains 25% to 50% equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.

## Naming Convention: "Redacted"

The name "Redacted" signifies fluidity and a lack of limitation to any single sector within Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>. This approach acknowledges the uncertainty of which Web3 sector will ultimately succeed, ensuring the entity remains adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. The name also plays into Web3 culture, where "redacted" is often used when discussing upcoming or unannounced projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.

## Journey to Founding Redacted

The founder's journey into Web3 began accidentally in 2021 as a co-founder of an NFT collection called Godjira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. The project gained significant traction, reaching a 25 ETH floor price for its Genesis collection and a $150 million market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This experience taught the founder about [[Marketing and branding in web 3 and NFTs | human psychology]] and the rapid virality possible in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

The early success led to a sense of responsibility towards the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. After experiencing challenges like a delisting from OpenSea in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, the team realized they couldn't rely solely on launching more NFT collections or royalties for revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

### Transition to Consulting and Syndication

To sustain operations and support their community, the team launched a consulting firm, helping over 20 projects with their launches and securing whitelist spots for their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This venture provided valuable connections, particularly with Web2 companies interested in Web3 without a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. It highlighted the need for Web2 businesses to establish a presence in Web3, even if they lacked understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

In 2023, the team launched PG Capital, an investment syndicate, to provide community members access to earlier, lower-valuation deals (pre-seed/seed rounds) instead of only public IDOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This model was inspired by Neotokyo, which incubated projects and offered deals to its holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. While the syndicate saw some big wins, such as a 50x return on a Supra investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, the administrative overhead and risk of projects failing or not launching led to the realization that a more scalable business model was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## Why Launch a Token for an Accelerator?

Launching a token for an accelerator is seen as a way to gain attention and establish a reward economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Many projects may not want to launch their own tokens, but they need to attract Web3 audiences who are often driven by reward mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Redacted's token (ARDAC) serves as a central point to reward users across its ecosystem, such as offering discounts on platform fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This approach allows products to gain a user base without being forced to launch their own tokens, while still enabling the team to collate value from all products into a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges of building in the web3 space | Challenges]] and Founder Accountability

### [[Challenges and opportunities in launching NFTs and crypto projects | Token Performance vs. Product Performance]]
A significant [[Challenges and opportunities in launching NFTs and crypto projects | challenge]] is that token performance is not directly correlated with product performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Even if a product achieves partnerships, real business value, and revenue, it may not translate to token value, leading to perceived failure and criticism falling on the overarching entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

### Founder Incentives and Token Unlocks
The founder emphasizes aligning founder and investor interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Unlike some founders who defend token floors using raised funds, potentially leading to failure, Redacted focuses on delivering on promises and building strong products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

Redacted has implemented strict token unlock conditions for its team:
*   The team token unlocks have a minimum 12-month cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   10% of team tokens unlock for every $100 million in market cap reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.
*   If the project doesn't hit a $100 million market cap, all team tokens are burned within 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   Full unlock of team tokens requires reaching a $1 billion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.

This structure ensures founders are incentivized to achieve substantial market cap and maintain a long-term vision, rather than dumping tokens early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. The team is also transparent about salaries and uses personal funds to buy their token, demonstrating belief in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Redacted aims to be a resilient business that can pivot when necessary, adapting to changing market metas rather than clinging to a single approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The goal is to leverage their four years of experience navigating Web3's highs and lows to execute a larger strategy in the token market over the next 3 to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This approach to [[Building and growing a decentralized venture ecosystem | decentralized venture ecosystem]] aims to foster growth by being flexible and community-focused.

The founder encourages supporting genuine teams, understanding their context, and looking beyond stereotypes or superficial judgments based on factors like origin or past project performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>. Transparency and direct engagement with founders through interviews and podcasts are highlighted as crucial for investors to gain a deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

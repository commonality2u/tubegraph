In the crypto industry, building a robust community is considered the sole path to effective marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. Unlike traditional tech where product launches might generate minimal engagement, the crypto community shows immense passion for decentralized technology, memes, and new innovations, even before products are perfected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Tapping into this energy is crucial for [[sponsorship_and_marketing_strategies_in_the_crypto_industry | project growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

## Monad's Approach to Community and Marketing

Monad, a parallel EVM layer 1 blockchain, successfully raised $225 million and gained significant hype due to its unique technology and strong community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

Monad's co-founder and CEO, Heon Han, explains that Monad is a "super performant blockchain that gives everyone The Best of Both Worlds," enabling developers to benefit from cheaper transactions and scale their decentralized applications to world adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This clear and simple value proposition, combined with the current inefficiencies in on-chain transactions, resonates strongly with the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Key Factors for Community Success

1.  **Unique and Needed Technology:** Monad's technology is differentiated and addresses a critical market need for higher performance in EVM blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
2.  **Strong Community Culture:** Monad's community is highly engaged, creative, and fun, contributing to widespread message dissemination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
3.  **Authenticity and Humor:** The team embraces the spirit of crypto Twitter by not taking themselves too seriously, allowing the company account to post memes and engage with community-driven lore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Strategies for [[the_importance_of_community_and_longterm_thinking_in_the_crypto_industry | Community Building]]

Han offers several insights on [[challenges_and_strategies_in_launching_and_scaling_a_crypto_startup | bootstrapping a crypto community]]:

*   **Start Early:** It's never too early to begin building your community. Monad launched its Discord channel in November 2022, just before the FTX collapse, which paradoxically helped attract dedicated crypto enthusiasts seeking a place to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **Engineer vs. Entrepreneur Mindset:** While engineers might prefer to build the product first and then market it, an entrepreneurial approach suggests generating momentum and selling the vision before the product is fully complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **Community as the Product:** Especially when the mainnet is far off, the community itself should be treated as the primary product. The goal is to make it "addictive" and enjoyable for members, fostering friendships and shared experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Financial Motivation:** While some community members may be financially driven, many stay because of genuine connection and fun. Creating an environment where people make friends and share lore helps build a lasting community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Authentic Engagement:** Avoid simply following a "Playbook" by outsourcing community management. Instead, commit founder time and real effort to nurture the community, organize events like karaoke nights or poker games, and support member-driven initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. This requires high attention to detail and a commitment to quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Thinking:** While there's often pressure for short-term gains, especially from investors, founders should prioritize building something that lasts multiple cycles, ignoring mercenary financial impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. Han predicts that more projects will start to acknowledge and integrate the importance of community into their long-term strategy in the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

## Broader Principles for [[insights_into_building_and_managing_a_business_in_the_crypto_industry | Success]]

*   **Disciplined Resource Management:** Despite raising significant capital, Monad maintains discipline in spending to ensure positive ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Performance:** Drawing from his experience at Jump Trading, Han emphasizes that performance, both in systems and individual efficiency, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **High Standard of Excellence:** Maintaining a high standard for all work fosters success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Humility:** Avoid hubris and projecting too much, as the smart and judgmental crypto community will quickly expose unbacked claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** "Boringly consistent" effort, chipping away daily towards the goal, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Acknowledge privilege and make the most of opportunities in the well-capitalized attention economy of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying Bottlenecks:** Monad's design was driven by observing real performance bottlenecks in Ethereum, specifically state access, which led to a new architecture to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond the Playbook:** While standard elements like DEXes, lending protocols, and NFTs are expected for a mainnet launch, true success comes from offering completely new, unique experiences for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Examples include social apps like Friend.Tech on Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Han emphasizes collaborating with ambitious builders who have these "out-of-the-box" ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

### Learning from Others

Han acknowledges the success of Solana, which chose to rebuild everything from scratch and focus on performance, demonstrating the value of going against the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. However, Monad also learned from Solana's "overreaction" of abandoning the EVM standard. Monad recognized the importance of meeting developers where they are and supporting Solidity due to its widespread use, libraries, tooling, and applied cryptography research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This highlights the balance between innovation and compatibility in [[digital_marketing_strategies_in_the_era_of_social_media_and_crypto | blockchain development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Han also admires projects like Oobaby Games, which exemplify building a great gaming experience and fostering community by tapping into the fun of inside jokes in a scalable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Their commitment to high attention to detail and not taking shortcuts results in high-quality, differentiated products with staying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

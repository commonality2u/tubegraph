Founded by Magnus Greenland, Antler focuses on building a global innovation platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, with a mission to make progress inevitable by supporting great people in innovating and moving the world forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy

Antler's investment strategy is built on a few core principles:
*   **Backing Founders from Day Zero** Antler backs founders before they even start building their business or when teams are about to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. This means they are taking on the absolute riskiest part of the investing game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on People, Not Just Ideas** The firm invests in founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>, believing that the earliest days of a business are the most important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. By working closely with founders before investment, Antler can significantly reduce risk and have an outsized impact on the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.
*   **Building Conviction through Collaboration** Antler spends real time with potential founders before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. This hands-on approach allows for a higher conviction rate in their investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.
*   **Risk Management** By providing access to co-founders, helping validate business models, and offering office space for the first four to six months, Antler contributes significant value and removes a lot of the inherent risk in early-stage investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. This approach highlights their focus on [[managing_risk_and_making_informed_investment_decisions | managing risk and making informed investment decisions]] at the earliest stages.

## Desired Founder Traits

Antler looks for specific traits in founders and founding teams, which they believe are insanely important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>:
1.  **Spike/Strength:** Founders should possess a unique skill set or strength where they are better than most other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. Antler prioritizes one exceptional strength over multiple average skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.
2.  **Drive:** This is a combination of passion, ambition, and a proven ability to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. Passion alone is not enough; it must be coupled with action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.
3.  **Grit/Resilience:** Founders must have a strong mindset and conviction that they will not give up on building their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>. Building a startup is a "high contact sport" requiring tremendous staying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>. Antler emphasizes that these traits are not innate and can be developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

## Scaling Investments and Operations

Antler plans to significantly increase its investment pace to reach its 2030 goal of 6,000 startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.
*   **Current Scale:** In 2023, Antler expects to make about 400 investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. They have 300 full-time staff, resulting in approximately 1.5 investments per person per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Applicant Volume:** Antler receives about 120,000 founder applicants per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>, significantly more than institutions like Harvard College or Y Combinator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>.
*   **Selectivity:** Despite the high volume, Antler maintains extreme selectivity, backing only about 2.4 investments per thousand applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.
*   **Growth Strategy:** To achieve 6,000 investments by 2030, Antler is setting up more locations, increasing fund sizes in existing locations, and slightly increasing its investment pace while founder applicants grow 2.5x per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. They are also building technology on a platform to be a very valuable early-stage investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>.
*   **Global Presence:** Antler operates in 28 locations across six continents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>, bringing in cohorts of 60 to 100 people who want to build something twice a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.

## "Front-Loading" and Hustle Culture

A core aspect of Antler's philosophy, advocated by Magnus Greenland, is "front-loading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>. This means dedicating 100% effective time to the business in the first year or two, especially the first few months, as momentum builds momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:18">[03:17:18]</a>. Founders are encouraged to exchange future time for concentrated effort in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:48">[03:28:48]</a>. This involves removing "wastes" like excessive Netflix, socializing, or partying, and focusing all energy on the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

Antler also emphasizes the importance of **hustling** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:48">[04:48:48]</a>. Unlike corporate or academic environments where tasks are assigned, entrepreneurs must actively convince people to invest, work for them, or become customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This requires getting comfortable with rejection and being persistent, even after receiving multiple "no's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Antler encourages founders to practice hustling in everyday situations to overcome discomfort with asking for favors or approaching strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This aggressive approach is seen as crucial for breaking through barriers and achieving significant goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

Hash, an early-stage venture fund focused on blockchain and cryptocurrency, is actively exploring the integration of Japanese anime and Korean pop (K-pop) culture with blockchain technology to bring crypto to the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. Ryan Kim, founding partner at Hash, believes these cultural phenomena can be a "game changer" for blockchain adoption due to their global audience and dedicated fanbases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Driving Mass Adoption Through Popular Culture

Anime and K-pop are seen as key avenues for [[crypto_adoption_and_the_role_of_blockchain_in_future_investments | mass adoption]] because they offer entertaining, yet addictive, services that can appeal to a broader audience, similar to how gaming was an early driver for internet adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

## Japanese Anime Integration

Hash's portfolio company, Kasak Labo (a Singaporean founder), acquired a major Japanese anime studio, Najja Studio, which is closely connected to other top anime studios in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>. The goal is to onboard Japanese intellectual property (IP) into the blockchain space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. Anime is experiencing an all-time high in viewership, with a very sticky and fanatical fanbase that actively buys merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. This engagement suggests that fans are eager to build their own networks around the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. There are ongoing efforts, such as the launch of "anime chain" by AI, to integrate anime with blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.

## Korean Pop (K-pop) Integration

Hash Studio initiated a K-pop chain and built its own K-pop entertainment company called Mood House, which manages two idol groups, Trip S and Emis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. K-pop, like anime, has a significant global audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>.

## Benefits of Blockchain for IP and Fandom

The primary benefit of integrating blockchain with these cultural IPs is enabling fans to own content and participate more actively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   **Ownership and Participation:** Fans can buy [[nfts_and_their_cultural_significance | NFTs]] or governance tokens of K-pop groups or anime IPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>. This moves fans beyond mere consumption to ownership, encouraging them to invest more resources and effort into the IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.
*   **New Funding Models:** While funding new IPs and receiving returns through future sales is a prominent scenario, the activities themselves are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.
*   **Community-Driven Growth:** Similar to how crypto projects grow by engaging with investors and potential investors in the community (e.g., on Twitter or at conferences), K-pop groups and anime IPs can utilize blockchain to foster larger, more engaged communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Trust:** The integration of blockchain can bring more transparency to the industry, although it may not prevent all market collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.

> "A lot of fans when they unboard they can buy NFTs or like go governance token of the each K-pop group or anime anime IP and fans or fans can participate like not total governance but they can enjoy to participate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>

> "Web3 the beauty of the web3 is that they can own it... they can be a owner of the certain IP then they can parti more resource and effort to the the IP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>

This approach is part of a broader strategy to utilize highly engaged global audiences to expand the blockchain ecosystem beyond traditional crypto investors.

Kujira is a platform that has garnered attention, especially following its IDO launch on StarTerra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The platform itself has been live for some time, awaiting the "cold5 upgrade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Kujira's Objective

[[kujiras_objective_in_the_crypto_market | Kujira's primary objective]] is to empower retail crypto users, enabling them to compete effectively with "whales and elites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Orca Protocol: Kujira's First Product

Orca is Kujira's inaugural product, designed as a platform for automated bids on collateral liquidated from Anchor Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The team highlights an intuitive design and "silky smooth UI" that simplifies the liquidation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Understanding Anchor Protocol Liquidations

To understand Orca, it's essential to grasp how Anchor Protocol liquidations function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The Kujira team has provided a detailed guide on this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
*   **Borrower's Role:** A borrower offers non-stable assets as collateral to put their value to work without selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Anchor lends out UST, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Borrowers can withdraw up to 60% of their deposited collateral's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **At-Risk Loans:** A loan becomes "at risk" if the collateral's value falls to a point where the loan exceeds a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Liquidation Process:** When an at-risk loan is liquidated, the lender (Anchor) receives back the UST they loaned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The borrower forfeits their collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Liquidator's Role:** Liquidators repay the shortfall on the collateral value to the lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. In return for this service, the collateral becomes the property of the liquidator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Liquidators are compensated with a premium, which is effectively a discount on the price of the non-stable assets used as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Orca's Mechanism and Features

On Orca, the discount on collateral can range from 1% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Bids can be placed at any of these premium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Market forces dictate that liquidators accepting smaller premiums (lower discounts) will be the first to access at-risk capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Historically, this was a "first come, first serve" basis, favoring the fastest execution of liquidation contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. With Orca, bids are filled starting from the lowest premium, moving up through tiers until all collateral is liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Orca's interface displays:
*   Premium rates from 0% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   Pool value in UST for each premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Information on interaction with Anchor Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Total locked collateral value in Anchor (e.g., 3.5 billion at the time of transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   Total pool value in Orca (e.g., 26.4 million at the time of transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   Total locked collateral in bLuna (e.g., 65.3 million at the time of transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Users can place bids by selecting an amount in UST and a premium rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. There are no minimum or maximum bid amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Once a bid is successfully submitted, it can be activated in approximately 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. When a liquidation occurs, the payout is received in the collateral asset itself, such as bLuna or bETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. The platform also shows the user's average discount received on these collateral assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Users can cancel their bids without a locking period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Moral Conflict: While some may have moral conflict about liquidating other DeFi users, bidding at lower percentage rates (e.g., 2-5%) means the liquidated person loses less collateral compared to a 30% premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This provides a "better" outcome for the borrower, even if not ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Kujira Tokenomics

The Kujira project will have a token on the Terra network with a total supply of 150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Its project valuation is currently 27 million UST, considered a "pretty low market cap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The team aims to raise 3 million UST from the StarTerra IDO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. [[tokenomics_and_roadmap_of_the_kujira_project | Further details on token distribution]] for seed rounds, liquidity, marketing, and airdrops are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Future Offerings: Beluga

As part of [[tokenomics_and_roadmap_of_the_kujira_project | Kujira's product roadmap]], another offering called Beluga is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Beluga will allow users to send any CW20 tokens (Terra network tokens) to multiple addresses simultaneously using a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

This feature is designed to significantly reduce gas fees. For example, testing showed that sending a transaction to 11 different addresses cost $3.20, whereas 11 separate transactions would have cost 22 UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Overall Vision

[[building_cryptocurrency_platforms_focused_on_user_needs | Kujira's broader aim]] is to build a suite of products that provides users with access to previously uncommon or unseen tools in the crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

For more information, readers are encouraged to explore Kujira's website, read the white paper, and understand Anchor's liquidation mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

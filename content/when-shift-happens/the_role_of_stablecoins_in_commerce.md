The contrast with traditional banking is stark: trying to receive payments in USD into a Hong Kong bank account for conversion to [[importance_of_stablecoins_in_cryptocurrency | stablecoins]] proves to be a "nightmare" due to delays and inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:48">[01:32:48]</a>. This highlights the practical benefits of [[importance_of_stablecoins_in_cryptocurrency | stablecoin]] transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>. The podcast itself operates by paying its team in [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_everyday_transactions | USDC]] or [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_everyday_transactions | USDT]], offering the choice to be paid "earlier" via crypto rather than "way too late" through traditional banking issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:45">[01:34:45]</a>.

An experience during a venture capital raise revealed that receiving funds via [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_everyday_transactions | USDC]] or [[the_role_of_stablecoins_in_everyday_transactions | USDT]] was "beautiful" and made the process "more efficient, less stress-free" compared to traditional wire transfers, especially for smaller checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:34">[01:33:34]</a>.

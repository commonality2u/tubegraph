AI is poised to fundamentally alter daily life, impacting various sectors, similar to the profound changes brought by transport and the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Ram Kamar, a core contributor at OpenLedger, a next-gen blockchain network, emphasizes that AI will have a significantly larger impact than previous innovations, potentially "100x" all advancements made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## OpenLedger: A Decentralized Economic Infrastructure for AI
OpenLedger aims to provide [[The Role of Crypto in AI Development | decentralized economic infrastructure]] for sourcing, fine-tuning, and launching specialized AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It enables the creation of AI models designed to solve specific, specialized problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## AI's Transformative Power
AI is described as being "way bigger" than the internet because it not only processes information but also assists in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. The internet primarily connected people and provided information access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. In contrast, AI serves as an "exocortex" or "rented brain," making humans smarter and boosting productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. There is a belief that AI could increase the average human IQ by at least 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. AI has the potential to bring intelligence to regions where resources like schooling are tough to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.

The evolution of technology, from the industrial revolution (250 years) to the internet (20 years), suggests that AI's impact will be much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

## The [[The Role of Crypto in AI Development | Role of Crypto in AI Development]]
Crypto acts as a supporting technology for ongoing revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. In finance, crypto helped democratize access, ensuring fairness and equal opportunity for banking and money access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Similarly, for AI, crypto aims to make AI fairer and more democratized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

### Data as the Core Need for AI
Just as content enriched the internet, AI needs vast amounts of data to become more intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Currently, most AI models are trained on readily available internet data, often scraped without compensation to the original data owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The true, specialized knowledge resides with individuals, enterprises, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

### OpenLedger's Approach: Fairness and Incentivization
OpenLedger focuses on bringing fairness to those who contribute data and knowledge to AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. It incentivizes people to provide their proprietary information, knowing they will be continuously benefited, unlike one-time payments in traditional models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

The goal is to ensure that everyone owns a piece of the AI intelligence, rewarding all participants in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This fosters a collective effort, akin to an "infinite sum game" where people work together to build something big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This model can be compared to YouTube or Kaito, where content creators are rewarded for their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

## Understanding OpenLedger: Specialized AI Models
OpenLedger enables the creation of specialized AI models tailored for specific needs, contrasting with generic AI models (like general-purpose Large Language Models such as OpenAI or Llama models) that are trained on broad internet data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

```ad-note
**Analogy of the Knife and Steak**

To simplify, a "generic AI model" is like a butter knife â€“ it can do general tasks but isn't efficient for specialized ones. OpenLedger provides the tools to create "specialized AI models," which are like tailored knives, designed to efficiently solve particular problems (the "stake") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
```

The process involves raw materials (data, specialized versions of data), knowledge, and feedback from contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. OpenLedger ensures that anyone who contributes to this supply chain, from providing data to giving feedback, gets benefited when the resulting AI models are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

## [[Decentralized AI versus Traditional Cloud Providers | Decentralized AI vs. Centralized AI]]
The primary problem with current AI models, especially for advanced [[The intersection of crypto and AI agents | AI agents]], is their generalized nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. While general models are fine for broad contexts, they are "stupid" when it comes to executing specific tasks like a [[Decentralized finance DeFi and its potential | DeFi]] agent making trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

Big AI companies (centralized models) typically operate with a capitalistic mindset, prioritizing company profit and investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. In contrast, crypto-based decentralized models like OpenLedger prioritize community benefit alongside team and investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. They rely on community support and crowdsourcing of data, encouraging participation by offering long-term value for contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.

It is acknowledged that [[Decentralization vs centralization in crypto platforms | decentralization]] is not universally needed and should be applied strategically where it offers distinct advantages, such as for niche or highly specialized problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.

### Concrete Example: Move Programming Language Model
An example of a specialized model built on OpenLedger is one for the Move programming language, a relatively new language used by some Web3 protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. While a general co-pilot like Cursor may not efficiently understand Move-based requirements, a specialized Move model built on OpenLedger can significantly outperform it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. This specialized model can enable better co-pilot [[The intersection of crypto and AI agents | agents]] for Move, assisting programmers, auditing code, and analyzing flaws more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Journey and Lessons
The founder's journey into crypto began in 2017, initially through being paid in Bitcoin for a tech business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This led to building an R&D firm that grew to over 200 employees, working with large enterprises like Kia, Walmart, and Pepsi to integrate Web3 solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### The Pursuit of Impact over Profit
Despite running a profitable R&D company, the desire for "real impact" drove the shift towards OpenLedger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. The core motivation is to bring fairness and opportunity to people, a concept inherently strong in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### Resilience in Crypto
The crypto space is highly volatile, with frequent highs and lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Experiencing market crashes (e.g., Luna) teaches the importance of perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Successful entrepreneurs in crypto learn to look at the long-term vision, rather than being swayed by daily market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This long-term perspective is crucial for [[The evolution and future of crypto and AI integration | building wealth with crypto and AI]] and ensuring product sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

## Conclusion: Fairness in the AI Revolution
The overarching message is that AI is an undeniable revolution, and it's essential to ensure its development is fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. Unlike past revolutions where fairness was often lacking, crypto offers the tools to ensure that AI development benefits everyone who contributes, rather than just a few centralized entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. OpenLedger aims to be a project that embodies this fairness by rewarding those who build better, specialized AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

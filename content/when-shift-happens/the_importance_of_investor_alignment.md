Choosing investors wisely is a critical factor for the long-term success of a business, particularly for startups and high-growth companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. Misalignment between founders and investors can lead to significant problems, even if the business is otherwise profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.

## Consequences of Misaligned Investors

One key issue arises when investors' interests conflict with the company's strategic direction. For instance, in an early trading firm, investors who were diversified might not want the company to expand into new asset classes if it meant competing with other groups they had already invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. This creates a conflict of interest, restricting the company's growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.

Another problem can stem from differing time horizons. If investors are primarily focused on short-term returns, similar to a fund allocator, they might constantly question daily performance, which can be detrimental to a business aiming for long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. This contrasts with venture capitalists (VCs), who are typically prepared to bet on a company for the long haul, understanding that their investment might be lost if it fails, but with the potential for massive returns if it succeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

## Strategies for Achieving Alignment

### Choosing Long-Term Partners
For Wintermute, a crucial lesson learned from a previous venture was the need to select investors who share a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. This led them to structure their funding rounds with VCs rather than fund allocators, ensuring that their backers were aligned with their long-term growth strategy and were not preoccupied with daily returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>. This commitment allowed Wintermute to focus on building their infrastructure for nearly two years before actively engaging in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.

### Communication and Transparency
Effective [[communication_and_feedback_in_business_and_relationships | communication]] is paramount to maintaining investor alignment. It is essential to articulate long-term goals and why certain strategic decisions, even those that don't yield immediate results, are crucial for future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:24">[01:53:24]</a>. Founders need to explain their vision clearly, especially for initiatives that require a longer time horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:38">[01:53:38]</a>.

### Focusing on Core Principles
Aligning with investors means finding partners who are willing to support the core mission and values of the company, especially during challenging market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>. For Wintermute, this meant building and focusing on their business even during market "winters," which allowed them to gain market share while competitors overextended themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.

This strategic investor selection and continuous alignment have been vital for Wintermute's success, allowing them to build a resilient and scalable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

Speculation is recognized as a fundamental driver for nascent markets, including cryptocurrency, by industry figures like Melum Demos, an early crypto investor and general partner at Crucible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Demos, who states she became wealthy through speculation, asserts that many in the crypto space owe their wealth to this activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Indispensable Role of Speculation

Speculation is viewed as the "fuel that makes the future possible" in emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. Melum Demos emphasizes that [[volatility_and_speculative_crypto_investments | greed]] is critical in helping nascent markets reach the next stage of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.

### Historical Parallels

This pattern of intense speculation surrounding new technologies is not unique to crypto. Economist Carlota Perez's book, "Technological Revolutions and Financial Bubbles," highlights similar phenomena in historical contexts, such as the railroad boom and the dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. In these instances, new technologies were overcapitalized, leading to many failed ventures but ultimately catalyzing significant industrial shifts and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.

Cryptocurrency has experienced multiple waves of fervent speculation, including:
*   Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>
*   Decentralized Finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>
*   Layer 2 protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>

A small number of projects emerge as significant winners from these speculative bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

### Critiquing Anti-Speculation Stances

Melum Demos expresses aggravation with individuals in crypto who have amassed wealth and influence due to speculation but then denounce it as "not a real use case" or "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. She argues that such intellectual dishonesty makes crypto appear more "scammy" and advocates for an honest embrace of speculation as a foundational aspect of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.

## Impact on Innovation and Infrastructure

Speculative fervor is credited with providing projects like Helium with the capital and runway needed to survive for years and eventually develop real production value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. Without such [[the_role_of_speculation_and_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | speculative fervor]], many projects would lack the necessary resources to figure out their models and build viable supply and demand sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.

Speculation also drives price, and price, in turn, drives further price action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>. The shift in the investing community from traditional research-driven models to social media-driven insights has fueled this [[volatility_and_speculative_crypto_investments | volatility and speculative crypto investments | volatility]], with crypto acting as a "supercharged" environment due to its 24/7, 365-day instant liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_speculation_and_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | Meme Coins]] and NFTs

Melum Demos cites investments in early NFTs like Ether Rocks and CryptoDickbutts as examples of her own speculative investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. She bought an Ether Rock for approximately $35,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Ether Rocks, created in 2017, are among the earliest NFTs, consisting of 100 unique clip art images of rocks with slight shade variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. The absurdity of these assets, coupled with their scarcity, made them a status symbol and a form of "performance art" within the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>.

Similar to Ether Rocks, [[the_role_of_speculation_and_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coins]] are described as absurd and preposterous, yet they gain significant valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. Demos argues that the difference between these [[the_role_of_speculation_and_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coins]] and some highly capitalized protocols with low utility is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. She suggests that [[the_role_of_speculation_and_meme_coins_in_the_crypto_market | meme coins]] are popular partly because they lack venture capitalist backing, which can be seen as a rebellion against the "low-flow, high-FDV paradigm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. Their inherent humor and entertainment value also contribute to their appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.

## [[Market trends and cryptocurrency cycles | Market Dynamics]] and Future Outlook

The increased [[volatility_and_speculative_crypto_investments | volatility]] in public equities since the pandemic is attributed to the shift in investing intelligence from closed, subscription-based research to free, widely accessible information on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>. This has made markets more trend and narrative-driven, a characteristic that crypto supercharges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>.

For investors, the approach to speculation is not about judging "good or bad" but about adapting to market realities to effectively deploy capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>. Melum Demos embraces speculation and is open to pitches that focus on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. Her biggest prediction for the next 12 months is "up only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:45">[01:41:45]</a>.

Ben believes that [[The role of education and AI in entrepreneurship | profiting from education]] "just doesn't go well" with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. This conviction led him to establish his own nonprofit preschool in Singapore, after discovering there were no other nonprofit preschools in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. While the initial impulse was not solely for his own children to attend, as his elder son had already enrolled in other schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>, the venture stemmed from a fundamental disagreement with the commercialized approach to early childhood education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>.

## Critiques of Traditional Preschools

Ben observed that many existing preschools in Singapore, such as E1 Odyssey, felt "very commercialized" and prioritized serving parents over the children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. He noticed schools "show off to the parents what the kids do," even if the children disliked it and were being forced into activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:34">[01:22:34]</a>.

He found the overall atmosphere of these schools to be more akin to "nanny school" services rather than genuine educational environments aligned with the children's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>. A specific example given was the common practice of forcing children to nap for an hour, even if they weren't tired, without providing alternative engaging activities for those who couldn't sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.

## Lily Valley: A Unique Educational Approach

Ben's preschool, Lily Valley, currently serves about 60 children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:49">[01:31:49]</a> and aims to address these issues with several key differences:

*   **Nonprofit Structure:** The fundamental principle is that the school operates as a nonprofit, meaning any profits generated are reinvested back into the school for facilities, teacher training, and equipment updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>. Ben intends to release financial books for transparency once the school becomes profitable, with an ultimate goal of running it as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) where enrolled parents can vote on how funds are spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>.
*   **Child-Centric Approach:** The primary "clients" of the school are the children, not the parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.
*   **Reggio Emilia Philosophy:** The school adopts the Reggio Emilia approach, which assumes children instinctively know what they want. Teachers are facilitators, guiding and discovering children's interests rather than molding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a>. This requires a low teacher-to-student ratio (10-15 kids per teacher maximum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>.
*   **Play-Based and Experiential Learning:** The school is designed with various play-based areas like sand, cinema, art, and physical/water zones, encouraging discovery through touch and perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>. Teachers observe which perceptions trigger engagement and design classes around those interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:35">[01:26:35]</a>.
*   **Intermingled Ages:** The school promotes mixed-age interactions, allowing older and younger children to play and learn together, mirroring a normal society where people of different ages interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>.
*   **Chinese Immersion:** Lily Valley offers a strong Chinese immersion program, employing top Chinese teachers from China, which is rare in Western schools that typically do not prioritize Chinese language learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:06">[01:27:06]</a>. This contrasts with traditional Chinese schools that are often "so strict" and rely on memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:23">[01:27:23]</a>.
*   **Technology Integration:** The school embraces technology as a tool for learning, with interactive playgrounds that respond to touch and projectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>. Ben believes in exposing children to technology like phones and iPads naturally, rather than hiding them, to prevent later addictive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>. The goal is for technology to be a "mean to the end" of helping kids discover their passions, not an end in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>.

## Fostering Focus and Passion

Ben emphasizes the importance of children finding something they like to focus on, seeing "focus" as a crucial skill often lacking in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>. He encourages activities like playing with Lego, even if it means skipping meals, to allow for uninterrupted, devoted focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>. Similarly, he believes gaming can cultivate intense focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:07">[01:41:07]</a>.

His parenting [[Mindset and personal growth in entrepreneurship | philosophy]] is not to mold his children but to "discover what they like to focus in" by providing broad exposure to different activities like tennis or soccer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a>. This approach aims to help children find their "passion," which he believes is the key to [[Entrepreneurial journey and challenges | drive and success]] in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:48">[01:42:48]</a>. He laments the "sad" reality that many adults lack passion or even knowledge of what they want to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:17">[01:44:17]</a>.

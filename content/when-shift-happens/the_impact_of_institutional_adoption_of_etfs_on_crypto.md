Hunter Horsley, co-founder and CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, a leading provider of [[the_significance_of_index_funds_in_the_crypto_space|index funds]] in the crypto space, believes that public blockchains are a new technology platform capable of changing the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. He emphasizes Bitwise's mission to be "good stewards of the space" and help others participate in its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Why Blockchains Matter

Horsley explains that people approach the crypto space from different vantage points:
*   **Financial** They see it as an alternative asset class, a digital currency, a new banking rail, or infrastructure for tokenization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Socio-philosophical** They are motivated by the return of self-sovereignty, privacy, and a reduction in government control and censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Technology** They view public blockchains as a new computing platform or architecture, offering opportunities to build applications and reimagine services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Horsley's own perspective is rooted in technology, seeing blockchains as a "blossoming kernel of a new computing platform" that could define the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. He believes public blockchains will usher in an apolitical monetary instrument and apolitical applications, enabling people globally to use digital money and trusted applications freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This is critical because traditional organizational structures, like the C Corp, are man-made inventions that are not immune to change, especially with the advent of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Blockchains offer a new way for humans to coordinate and trust each other, providing a mechanism for establishing and enforcing rules in the digital world, where traditional "rule of law" is often lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## The Role of [[benefits_and_challenges_of_bitcoin_etfs|ETFs]] in Crypto Adoption

The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum [[benefits_and_challenges_of_bitcoin_etfs|ETFs]] by the SEC is a monumental development for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. Previously, investing in crypto was akin to investing in a private company like OpenAI â€“ requiring significant effort, unfamiliar services, and often a lack of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.

### Enhanced Accessibility
With [[benefits_and_challenges_of_bitcoin_etfs|ETFs]], crypto becomes accessible through familiar brokerage accounts, prompting investors to consider if it's a valuable opportunity or overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. This marks the start of a new chapter for the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

### Institutional Adoption Data
The data on institutional adoption of Bitcoin [[benefits_and_challenges_of_bitcoin_etfs|ETFs]] is striking:
*   Two quarters after its launch in 2004, the gold ETF (GLD) was owned by just over 100 institutional investors (managing over $100 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>.
*   In the same timeframe, the Bitcoin [[benefits_and_challenges_of_bitcoin_etfs|ETFs]] saw over 1,000 institutional investors, representing a 10x faster adoption rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.
*   While 80% of traditional public markets are owned by institutional investors, only about 2% of crypto and Bitcoin are currently institutionally owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>. This indicates massive potential for future institutional capital inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>.

## Future Outlook: Banks and Interest Rates
Horsley predicts that within 12 months, the majority of banks and broker-dealers in the US will have approved access to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>. He believes that the crypto community will realize that banks are a "huge catalyst" for the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>.

### The Role of Banks
*   Banks manage the savings and wealth of millions, and their financial advisors can help clients participate in crypto, particularly those who are uncomfortable with direct app usage or managing taxes/estate planning themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>.
*   Banks facilitate capital markets through prime brokerage, margin, lending against assets like Bitcoin, and custody services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>. Once regulatory constraints are lifted, banks will become major catalysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.

### [[impact_of_technological_advancements_and_market_patterns_on_crypto_investments|Impact of Interest Rates]]
The impending reduction in interest rates is expected to be a significant catalyst for crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:47">[01:23:47]</a>. When central banks cut rates, the real yield from fixed income products (like bonds) decreases significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>. This will cause trillions of dollars in fixed income (over $60 trillion in the US alone) to seek new avenues for investment, potentially flowing into uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.

## Maturity of the Crypto Space
Despite past "crazy cycles" and scandals that burned many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>, Horsley believes that large-scale blow-ups like those in 2022 are less likely to happen again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. The space is maturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>. Fraudulent or poorly managed counterparties were largely "wiped out," leaving behind higher quality and more durable market participants such as Bitwise, Coinbase, Fidelity, and Interactive Brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">[01:35:07]</a>. This professionalization of the counterparty landscape significantly reduces systemic risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.

## Horsley's Message to the Crypto Industry
Horsley's message to the crypto industry and community is to "think bigger, be more positive, and think about the good that this space is going to do in the world and focus on that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>. He stresses the need for better communication about crypto's purpose and benefits to the broader public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

Postquantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to mathematical threats posed by future quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. It is also known as quantum-safe cryptography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. The development and implementation of this new form of cryptography are becoming increasingly crucial due to the imminent threat posed by quantum computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.

## The Quantum Threat
Current global cryptography, largely based on elliptic curve cryptography, is vulnerable to quantum attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. While classical computers find it incredibly difficult to break these keys (requiring potentially billions of years of computing power from all Earth's computers), quantum computers are exceptionally good at performing the specific mathematical calculations needed to compromise them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

The risk of quantum computers breaking current encryption is "definitely coming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>, with specialists predicting its arrival within the next five to seven years, and this timeline appears to be shortening rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. Quantum chips are already functional, specializing in mathematical operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>.

The consequences of this vulnerability are profound:
*   **Data Harvesting and Decryption** Data encrypted with current methods can be harvested now and stored, then decrypted in two, three, or five years once sufficiently powerful quantum computers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
*   **Compromise of Secrets** Anything of value protected by quantum-vulnerable cryptography — including sensitive information, nuclear codes, and even Bitcoin — could be accessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Imbalance** The ability for a single entity (country, adversary, hacker) to access "all secrets in the world at the same time everywhere" would create the "biggest geopolitical imbalance" in modern history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

## Solutions and Implementation
To counter these threats, the focus is on developing quantum-resistant algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. Naris Protocol claims to be the first postquantum blockchain in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. They have collaborated with the IEEE foundation to create a peer-reviewed white paper on postquantum and blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>.

The approach involves:
*   **Decentralizing Trust**: Creating a "universal trust system" that uses robust mathematical principles ("quantum fingerprints") to allow machines to validate and verify each other's trustworthiness, much like people in a village establish trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Decentralization**: Rather than building new systems, Naris Protocol utilizes existing decentralized infrastructure (like organizations and governments with their established systems) and applies strong mathematical principles to create consensus and prove the good state of processes and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.
*   **Sub-Zero Layer**: Implementing a "sub-zero layer" to decentralize the core infrastructure of blockchains, such as validators, making them quantum-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.
*   **Postquantum Transactions**: Ensuring that transactions themselves are postquantum, preventing quantum computers from manipulating or double-spending approved transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

### Impact Across Industries
The need for postquantum cryptography extends beyond just crypto, impacting various sectors:
*   **Financial Transactions**: Ensuring the integrity of bank swift transactions, processes, and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.
*   **Blockchain Security**: Addressing the vulnerability of current blockchain cryptography and its reliance on centralized points of failure (e.g., validators hosted on clouds or personal computers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Enterprise and Critical Infrastructure**: Including telecommunications, software development, robotics, and car manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. Smart cars, for example, are servers on wheels, and their security is paramount to prevent catastrophic failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Ensuring the trustworthiness of AI models, the integrity of data sources, and the secure transmission of information to and from AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.

## Centralization vs. Trust
A foundational problem identified is centralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Centralized principles force reliance on systems that cannot be mathematically proven to be trustworthy, leading to inherent risks based on assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. The shift to postquantum cryptography emphasizes the need for trust by design, enabling proof of integrity in digital systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

Governments and major technology companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Google are heavily investing in quantum technologies, recognizing that the future internet (Web4) will be quantum-driven, with trust and AI by design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. China, for instance, has invested more in quantum technologies than its nuclear arsenal in recent years, highlighting its strategic importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. The US has even enacted laws requiring government-affiliated entities to be postquantum before 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

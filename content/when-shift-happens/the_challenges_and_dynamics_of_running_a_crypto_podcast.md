Steady Lads is a rising star in the crypto podcast scene, hosted by Jordy Alexander, the founder of Selini Capital; Justin Bram, CEO at Asteria; and Tai Ma, The Humble Farmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The podcast was launched in the middle of a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Motivation and Philosophy
The hosts aimed to provide thought leadership in an entertaining way, acknowledging that attention spans in crypto are very short, around 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Justin and Tai initially connected, recognizing they could attract any co-host they desired, and Tai reached out to Jordy, who then brought in Tai, forming the core team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

The goal is to create a unique category for their podcast rather than trying to become the number one in an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. They strive to be a "three-star Michelin Chef" in podcasting, creating content that is both "healthy" (informative) and "tasty" (entertaining) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

## Podcast Dynamics and Approach
Steady Lads represents different sections of the community, aiming to provide a consistent overall outlook and evaluation of the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The hosts bring diverse backgrounds: one is a pseudo-VC/market maker, another builds brands and educates, and the third focuses on product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This diversity helps them avoid being just "three VCs talking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

A key aspect of their success is consistency; 90% of podcasts don't make it past the third episode, and 90% of those that survive don't make it past the tenth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. They continuously "show up," which people recognize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The podcast is viewed as an "ongoing evolution," with continuous improvement based on listener feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This means almost "starting from scratch" for every episode, which is not very scalable but makes a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The hosts note that their effort has increased over time, spending more time ensuring the podcast is "tight" and topics make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. They include light-hearted and fun segments like "pasta of the week" to keep listeners engaged and provide "dopamine hits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>.

### Audience and Reach
The podcast primarily targets a crypto-native audience, with most listeners working in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. They believe this allows their thought leadership to filter out to other layers of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The show reaches more people than main stage talks at large crypto conferences, even from the comfort of their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Running a Podcast as a Business
Starting a podcast is likened to starting a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. The hosts don't aim to monetize directly with sponsors but find the show beneficial in various ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Benefits for the Hosts
*   **Brand Building**: It helps hosts build their personal brand, influence, and reach, making it easier to connect with the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Deeper Connections**: Listeners gain a deeper understanding of the hosts, leading to more efficient and meaningful interactions when meeting in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: Seeing the audience at meetups, like the 300-400 people who attended a Steady Lads event, provides motivation, especially during bear markets when growth is slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Learning**: Hosting the weekly show forces them to stay interested and pay attention to the space, leading to continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The podcast has even opened doors to meeting prominent figures like Vitalik Buterin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### Challenges of Podcasting
*   **Consistency**: Showing up every week is challenging, especially for busy individuals, but it's crucial for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Filler" Episodes**: A key lesson is to avoid releasing content that isn't good enough, as listeners will quickly notice and complain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
*   **Live Streams**: Live streams can lack structure and energy if not carefully managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Credibility**: A significant [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_industry | challenge]] is balancing the desire for views by featuring celebrities or controversial figures with maintaining the show's credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. This involves being willing to *not* release episodes if they don't meet quality or ethical standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   **Speaking Truth to Power**: Unlike some VC podcasts that avoid criticism to maintain deal flow, Steady Lads is willing to "call out" issues in the industry and give honest opinions, even if it hurts connections or speaking opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This was evident when they spoke out against Luna being unsustainable, while many major VCs remained silent due to interconnected relationships and fear of poisoning deal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>.

## Key Discussions and Perspectives
### Psychology of Investing
The hosts discuss common pitfalls in [[the_challenges_and_rewards_of_crypto_investing | crypto investing]]:
*   **Religiously Attaching to Assets**: People often get emotionally attached to an asset, similar to a football team, which makes it hard to sell when it's crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. They get conditioned to believe a certain action (like buying the dip) makes money until it fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **"Too Big to Fail" Mentality**: Even with projects like Luna, which was a top-5 crypto at its peak, investors still believed it was "too big to fail" despite fundamental flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   **"I Missed It" Psychology**: When an asset pumps, investors often feel they've missed out and hesitate to buy, even when it might still be early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. One suggested strategy is to buy a small amount (e.g., $100) to gain "skin in the game" and encourage further research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.
*   **Importance of Diversification**: Having diversity in a portfolio and assets with different return profiles is considered "the real Alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.
*   **Learning from Failure**: While some argue one needs to "blow up twice" in crypto, the hosts suggest once is enough to learn vital lessons, provided it's not "fatal" to one's career or finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. Blowing up helps build self-awareness and teaches humility about one's limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

### State of the Crypto Industry
*   **"Washing Out Bad People"**: The hosts question whether the bear market after FTX truly "washed out the bad people." They observe that many projects flourishing are "money games" or "gambling apps" rather than innovative, value-adding applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.
*   **Conferences as "Vacation as a Service"**: Some hosts criticize conferences like Token 2049, where projects might spend treasury funds on sponsorships and booths without necessarily adding real value or being well-known to industry insiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. However, they acknowledge the value of in-person interactions for gaining insights into founders and projects, which is harder to achieve remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
*   **Access to Founders**: The crypto space remains accessible, allowing "any old person" to meet founders of projects at conferences, similar to the early days of tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.
*   **Binance's Dynamics**: The hosts discuss the ongoing "shady" activities at Binance despite its size, attributing it to a clash between effective operations and commercial teams with different KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>.
*   **"Every Coin is a Meme Coin" Debate**: While acknowledging that every coin has a "percentage of memes" or "Vibes," the hosts push back against the idea that *all* tokens are purely meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. They believe in intrinsic value and want to avoid a "nihilistic meme culture" dominating the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on Real Applications**: A shared desire, even with Vitalik Buterin, is to see crypto applications that are simple enough for non-crypto users, like grandmothers, to use without worrying about the underlying blockchain complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.
*   **Tokenomics**: The hosts believe current tokenomics models are "complete trash" and "barbaric," expecting much better models to emerge in the future as the space matures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Predictions
*   **Live Events**: Following a successful meetup with 300-400 attendees, the hosts are considering half-day events around major crypto conferences, focusing on stage content and live Q&A rather than just networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>.
*   **Market Predictions**:
    *   One host is "Omega long DeFi coins," specifically Aave and Uniswap, believing the pendulum has swung too far towards "financial nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>.
    *   Another believes in being "longer Ethereum than Solana" over the next year, noting that while Solana is currently popular, L2s on Ethereum are growing massively and most innovation remains there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. A potential [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | challenge]] to this thesis is the possibility of "Operation Choke Point 3.0" if Kamala Harris wins the election, which could hinder application building and token value delivery in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>.
    *   A macro prediction is to be "long sound money" or "speculative stuff" and "not be long the dollar," as money printing is expected to continue due to political desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.

The hosts are grateful for the support and the ability to provide value to listeners' [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_crypto | crypto investing]] journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>.

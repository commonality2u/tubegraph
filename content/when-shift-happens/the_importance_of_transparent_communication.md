Transparent communication is crucial for building and maintaining trust, especially during a crisis. Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, demonstrated this principle following a significant hack, emphasizing that how a crisis is handled can determine a company's fate for years to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Leading Through Crisis with Directness

When faced with a $1.5 billion hack, Ben Zhou immediately understood that his role was to become the "PR guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. He chose to communicate directly with the public, bypassing traditional PR channels to ensure everyone received information straight from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

His decision to conduct a live stream where people could see his face, rather than just an audio Twitter Space, was critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This direct visual engagement fostered trust, as people could see his composure and commitment, understanding that he was not hiding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. He even shared a picture of his low stress score to reassure the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Zhou's immediate priorities upon learning of the hack were:
1.  **Assess the damage and containment:** Confirming if the problem was contained to one wallet and if other systems were secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
2.  **Ensure client funds are safe:** Confirming Bybit's ability to cover the loss with its own money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Prevent a bank run:** By immediately communicating the situation and reassuring clients that withdrawals would be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Impact on Trust and Confidence

This approach of radical transparency and professionalism in crisis management allowed Bybit to not only manage the immediate fallout but also to build stronger confidence among its clients and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Clients, VIPs, and institutions began returning quickly, seeing Bybit as battle-tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Even regulators reached out, expressing increased trust in Bybit's ability to handle future incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.

> "Our transparency and the way I think made the whole world see that how we handled crisis in such a professional ways and that actually give a lot of people confidence." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>

Unlike other companies that might enter phases of anger or depression after a hack, Ben Zhou "skipped the first three stages and went straight to the last one" by focusing on being the "captain of the ship" and bouncing back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This immediate focus on problem-solving, rather than dwelling on the loss, allowed for swift and clear communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Communication with the Team

Beyond external communications, Ben Zhou emphasized the importance of clear, decisive instructions for his internal team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. Bybit has a "P-minus-one" critical incident procedure that alerts all management and initiates a coordinated response, including a dedicated meeting room and assigned roles for note-taking, commanding, and instructing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

While procedures are in place, a significant amount of "judgment" is required during unforeseen events like a hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. This requires the leader to be cool-headed and understand priorities, such as securing client funds and maintaining withdrawals, even when facing unexpected issues like partners' funds being stuck in the same compromised system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The Bybit team's ability to develop a software solution to safely extract 3 billion USDT from a compromised wallet under immense pressure highlights their competence and trust in each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

## Industry-Wide Transparency through Initiatives

Ben Zhou believes that the crypto industry's inherent transparency is its strength, especially compared to traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>. To further promote transparency and address the issue of hacks, Bybit is launching `hackbounty.com` (or `hackbounty.crypto`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. This platform aims to:
*   Aggregate information about hacked funds and their endpoints (mixers, exchanges, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.
*   Allow "bounty hunters" to trace funds and register their findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>.
*   Rank entities based on their responsiveness to victim requests, pushing them to act quickly to avoid being on a "bad actors" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.

This initiative is a step towards using blockchain's transparency to solve a widespread problem, helping future victims and making it harder for hackers to launder funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>. It's an example of how the industry can collaboratively build trust and mature beyond the "mega drama" that often plagues it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.

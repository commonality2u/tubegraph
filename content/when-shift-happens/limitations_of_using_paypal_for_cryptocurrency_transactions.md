While PayPal has launched a service enabling eligible UK customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their accounts, certain limitations are noteworthy for users considering the platform for their crypto activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### No Peer-to-Peer Transfers or Payments

A significant limitation of [[paypal_cryptocurrency_services_in_the_uk | PayPal's cryptocurrency services]] is the inability to send cryptocurrency peer-to-peer or use it for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Users cannot currently send crypto to external wallets or use their purchased cryptocurrency to pay for goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. This means the service is primarily for buying and holding as an investment, similar to how Revolut introduced crypto to its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

### Centralized Nature and Control

PayPal's service is centralized, meaning users entrust their funds and assets to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. This setup necessitates a high degree of trust in PayPal, and it is important for users to understand PayPal's stance on aspects like private key ownership and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Know Your Customer (KYC) Requirements

As a centralized service, PayPal implements extensive Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Existing PayPal users will already have their personal details, bank account information, and address on file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

### Transaction Fees

The fee structure for [[comparison_of_fees_for_cryptocurrency_purchases_on_paypal | cryptocurrency purchases on PayPal]] can be a limiting factor, especially for smaller transactions. For instance, buying one pound's worth of Ethereum incurs a fee of 50 pence, which is considered "pretty steep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. While the fee remains 50 pence even for a ten-pound purchase, making it "a bit more palatable" proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, it still represents a significant percentage for small investments.

### Suitability for Users

The service is described as "very very basic" and "more suited to people that just want a tiny little bit of exposure" to the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. It is explicitly stated that it is "not really for advanced users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, indicating its limited functionality for more experienced cryptocurrency enthusiasts who might seek features like staking, decentralized finance (DeFi) interactions, or direct wallet control.

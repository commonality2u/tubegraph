The cryptocurrency industry, while still in its early stages, is a complex and dynamic environment marked by both significant [[challenges_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges]] and immense opportunities. Anil Lulum, co-founder and CEO of Deli Digital, a research-driven firm focused on advancing the digital asset market, offers insights into navigating this space and its [[future_prospects_and_trends_in_the_crypto_market | future prospects]].

## Current State of Crypto
Despite the rapid growth and widespread attention, Lulum emphasizes that "crypto is early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, comparing its stage to that of the internet in its nascent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. There's a common desire among many to "get rich quick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, but Lulum stresses that "everything is hard, everything takes time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Challenges and Resilience in the Crypto Industry
The crypto industry has faced significant [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_industry | challenges]] and setbacks, which have tested the resilience of its participants.

### Market Crashes and Industry Response
The collapse of major entities like Luna and FTX were significant events that impacted the entire ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Deli Digital, for instance, had significant investments in Luna, and the event happened right around Lulum's 30th birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. Despite personal and financial setbacks, the team's culture and mindset meant "no one really left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.

Lulum observed a lack of support from some "friends in the space" during difficult times, noting that many who were initially supportive disappeared when things turned negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. In contrast, those who offered support during such periods are hard to forget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. This highlights the importance of genuine relationships and a supportive community within the industry.

### Building and Scaling Businesses
Building a company in crypto, like running a research firm, consulting, or a design agency, is inherently difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>. Lulum notes that "Entrepreneurship is hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> and "anything is hard in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Deli Digital, like many startups, faced financial struggles in its early days, with founders living off 0% APR cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

A major [[challenges_in_the_crypto_industry | challenge]] is scaling, as Lulum admits he is "terrible at 1 to 10 or to 100" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, preferring the chaos of 0 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. However, delegating responsibilities and hiring more people allowed Deli to gain "breathing room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> and grow from "zero to one" to "one to 100" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Regulatory Environment
A significant [[challenges_and_perspectives_in_the_crypto_industry | challenge]] for the industry is the regulatory landscape, where "the government is constantly attacking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:24">[01:32:24]</a>. This creates uncertainty and deters many smart individuals from joining the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>. Lulum notes that the existence of a token can be "super stressful" for builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:14">[01:34:14]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Opportunities in the Crypto Market
Despite the [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | challenges]], Lulum expresses extreme optimism for [[the_future_of_the_crypto_market | the future of the crypto market]].

### Transformation and Impact
Lulum believes crypto represents a "parallel Financial system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a> that will be "embedded in every industry and facet of everyday life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>. He highlights that a significant portion of his net worth is already on-chain, something he "didn't even understand what that would have meant" 10 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>. This fundamental shift is "something pretty powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>.

### The Role of Regulation
Lulum's "biggest prediction for the next 12 months" is centered on regulatory change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. He states that if there's a "regime change and you get regulatory not just clarity but like regulatory support for crypto, it's going to be the most insane thing we've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>. This shift would encourage smart builders who are currently risk-averse to join the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a> and allow for new types of projects, including those that might pursue traditional IPOs rather than tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:34">[01:33:34]</a>.

### People and Collaboration
The crypto space, while appearing large, is "a much smaller space than you realize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>, especially among the "crypto native people" who are "deep in the trenches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. Lulum stresses the importance of building a good reputation and leaving a positive impression on everyone encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

He advocates for believing in people and supporting those who are trying to make their dreams come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. Finding a "tribe" or a small group (even 5-10 people) to share ideas and motivate each other is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18">[01:23:18]</a>. This collaborative mindset, where team members help each other rather than engaging in "PVP" (player-vs-player) competition, is seen as a "superpower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>.

### Continuous Learning and Adaptability
The industry demands continuous learning and staying "on the pulse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>. Lulum notes that if Deli were to "go to sleep for like 3-4 months," new people entering the space could quickly surpass them through dedicated learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. This highlights the rapid pace of [[insights_on_crypto_and_technological_advances | technological advances]] and the need for constant engagement.

New entrants to the crypto space often grapple with the question of how to build wealth without relying on luck or falling victim to scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The initial, simple advice is to "just buy Bitcoin and dollar cost average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This involves buying a portion with each paycheck and holding it to gain a feel for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. New investors must learn to navigate market corrections, where assets can drop significantly (e.g., 40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, eventually becoming accustomed and "numb" to the [[the_psychology_and_strategies_of_handling_investment_volatility | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Lure of Speculation

While Bitcoin is often recommended as a "digital gold" or "store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, many new investors quickly seek more [[speculation_in_cryptocurrency | speculative]] opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. They may feel that Bitcoin's potential gains (e.g., 2x from $100K to $200K) are insufficient compared to other crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

> "Yeah, but Bitcoin is uh 90K or 100K. If it goes to 200K, I'm only up to 2x. [\h__\h] this [\h__\h] bro. I want to make money, right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>

Even though Bitcoin has historically offered significant returns (e.g., 150% average returns since 2012) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, observing others achieve 100x gains in other cryptocurrencies can lead investors into a "danger zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This often involves going "all in" on highly speculative assets like "Fcoin" (a generalized term for a volatile, risky altcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It is advised to engage in such speculative ventures with only a small portion (e.g., 10%) of one's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Understanding and Managing Risks

The crypto space is replete with [[risks_of_crypto_investment | risks_of_crypto_investment]], necessitating constant paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### The Importance of [[investment_strategies_and_managing_risk_in_crypto | Portfolio Allocation]]

A crucial lesson in crypto [[investment strategies in the crypto market | investment strategies in the crypto market]], often overlooked by younger investors, is [[investment_strategies_and_managing_risk_in_crypto | portfolio allocation]] and [[investment_strategies_and_managing_risk_in_crypto | risk management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Proper allocation allows an investor to remain "not bothered" even if a significant portion of their portfolio, like Solana, drops by 50-60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The alternative can be devastating, as seen with leveraged positions leading to total loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### The Perils of Yield Farming and DeFi

Seeking yield on crypto holdings can introduce significant [[risks_of_crypto_investment | risks_of_crypto_investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Engaging with DeFi protocols for yield can lead to immediate total loss if something goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The pursuit of even small percentages of yield, like 6%, can be detrimental if it entails a percentage chance of losing all principal, especially when that probability is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Security Risks: Wallet Hygiene and Paranoia

Beyond market [[volatility and speculative crypto investments | volatility]], crypto investors face numerous security threats:
*   **Hacks:** Exposing one's wallet or lacking proper wallet hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Impersonation:** Scammers impersonating individuals or exchanges like Coinbase to gain access to funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

Maintaining a paranoid mindset, constantly considering potential pitfalls, helps mitigate these [[risks_of_crypto_investment | risks_of_crypto_investment]] and prevents complacency, which can lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Case Study: The Luna Crash

The collapse of Luna serves as a stark reminder of the extreme [[risks_of_crypto_investment | risks_of_crypto_investment]] in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Luna did not simply go to zero, but rather progressively declined to fractions of a cent, with continuous 90% drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Despite the expectation that it might become a meme coin due to its notoriety, it did not, largely because of the immense financial and emotional toll it took on investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Large investors lost hundreds of millions, with one firm losing $3.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This experience instilled a deep scar, reinforcing the need for caution in [[investment strategies and managing risk in crypto | investment strategies and managing risk in crypto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Yield in Crypto: A Deeper Dive

The concept of earning yield on crypto assets, particularly on Bitcoin, is a growing narrative within the space, especially with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi and staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Bitcoin DeFi and Staking

While institutions may prefer yield on assets like Bitcoin, similar to how they seek it for gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, many experienced investors advocate for focusing on capital gains rather than yield in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The argument is that the potential for significant capital gains in crypto far outweighs the minimal extra percentage from yield, which introduces undue [[risks_of_crypto_investment | risks_of_crypto_investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

Bitcoin ETFs might eventually seek yield through borrowing fees, provided by large institutions with backstop protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. However, yield-enhancing products, even those with smart teams behind them, are considered potential "weak points" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. For instance, Lido, a prominent staking aggregator, presents a yield curve mismatch where short-term access to yield is offered despite underlying assets being locked up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The complexity of managing liquidity in such systems has not been sufficiently stress-tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Yield for Institutions vs. Retail Investors

The consensus among some experts is that yield-enhancing products should primarily be for professionals and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. These entities possess the understanding of counterparty [[risks_of_crypto_investment | risks_of_crypto_investment]] and market complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. For the average person, seeing a seemingly high yield (e.g., 20%) can lead to a dangerous pursuit of wealth without comprehending the underlying [[risks_of_crypto_investment | risks_of_crypto_investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

> "Does the 6% yield actually matter to you? Oh, but it gives me cash flow. I saw but if I'm 6% you get 6% and there's a there's a percentage chance of losing all of your money and you don't know what that percentage chance are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

In essence, while the market is expected to grow over time due to adoption and central bank policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, investors must remain vigilant about managing [[risks_of_crypto_investment | risks_of_crypto_investment]] and avoiding excessive [[speculation_in_cryptocurrency | speculation]] or greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Arthur Breitman's journey into crypto began as a hobby that eventually "caught up" with him as the industry grew exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He started working on Tezos in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Career and Interests

Breitman moved to London in February 2019 to be closer to France, specifically Nomadic Labs, a company actively working on the Tezos protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. His wife is American and a French speaker, and they sought an English-speaking country, finding London to be the closest equivalent to New York, where he had lived for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. He thrives on high-energy environments and interaction with people, which he considers his source of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

Arthur Breitman describes his childhood as "pretty normal" and happy, though he found it difficult to fit in at school initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. He later attended a Magnet High School, which was a "much better experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. He attributes some of his early difficulties to dressing differently (corduroy pants, button-down shirts) and being "probably pretty arrogant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This arrogance, he believes, was a reaction to being rejected, forming part of his identity as a defense mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. He was also among the shortest in his class until age 17, when he grew significantly taller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. He was generally poor at sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. From an early age, he felt he was smarter than those around him, often achieving top grades in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

He began playing piano as a child but found himself "mediocre" at it, even getting bullied at music camp for being "too nerdy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. He resumed piano during the pandemic, finding enjoyment in the process itself rather than focusing on competitive achievement, viewing it as a form of meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

After engineering school, Breitman moved to New York to work in finance, specifically in machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. His interest in finance began young, evidenced by his desire to visit the New York Stock Exchange at age nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. He developed an interest in machine learning and statistics around the beginning of high school, teaching himself through books from the library and later engaging in competitive programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. He lacked mentors in these early stages of his learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

His first job in New York was at a small startup focused on the semantic web, aiming to make web pages machine-readable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He notes the irony that developing advanced artificial intelligence for natural language understanding became easier than convincing people to adopt structured data formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>. He then transitioned to working as an intern for Lehman Brothers and later several hedge funds, primarily in statistical arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>. This involved identifying and profiting from statistical patterns and price discrepancies in public markets, often through automated trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>. He worked in this field from around 2004 (internships) to 2016 (full-time starting 2007) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>. The 2008 financial crisis affected his first hedge fund's fundraising but did not significantly impact him personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>.

## Founding Tezos

Breitman's [[transition_from_traditional_finance_to_decentralized_finance | transition from finance to crypto]] wasn't direct. In 2016, he first moved from traditional finance to robotics, working for Waymo (then part of Google X), Alphabet's self-driving car division, for a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>. His interest in crypto, particularly Tezos, remained a hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>.

He started working on Tezos in 2014, driven by an "intellectual challenge" and a desire to correct misconceptions he observed online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. He published a white paper in 2014 to explore topics like smart contracts and proof-of-stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>. Although it was a hobby, he invested money and hired a small team to build it, viewing it as an "option" with the potential for significant learning, even if it didn't amount to much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. His wife was supportive from the beginning and became more full-time involved in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:24:00">[36:24:00]</a>. While working with a life partner carries risks, he highlights the benefit of knowing each other well and being compatible, especially through shared traumatic experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:00">[36:54:00]</a>.

In July 2017, the Tezos Foundation raised $232 million, primarily in Bitcoin and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>. Despite this massive success, Breitman remained at his robotics job until August 2017 because he "loved robotics" and wanted to work on self-driving cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:12:00">[38:12:00]</a>. The fundraising was structured to allow the project to launch independently via a Swiss foundation, enabling him to focus on his robotics interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.

The success of the Tezos fundraiser was partly due to timing, coinciding with high stress in the Ethereum community regarding governance and smart contract security, issues Tezos's 2014 paper had addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>. Tezos's unique approach, like allowing Bitcoin contributions from exchanges, also played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>. The project resonated with people who saw it as a solution to existing problems in decentralized governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:35:00">[41:35:00]</a>. Notably, Tezos was developed concurrently with Ethereum, not as a reaction to its problems, but rather anticipated theoretical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Aftermath

Despite the successful fundraiser, the Tezos project faced immense challenges, including six personal lawsuits and a "psychopath in Switzerland trying to bankrupt us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:50:00">[46:50:00]</a>. Breitman described it as a "perfect storm," compounded by continuous "slandering in the press" for approximately six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:27:00">[45:27:00]</a>. The extensive transparency of the project ironically made it an easy target for "lazy wire reporters" seeking scandalous ICO stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:41:00">[45:41:00]</a>. Even years later, investigations found nothing unethical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:05:00">[46:05:00]</a>.

The constant public scrutiny and personal attacks were a significant toll, more so than the price swings of the volatile crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:50:00">[46:50:00]</a>. He coped by taking things "one step at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:45:00">[47:45:00]</a>. For a short period, he took anxiolytics prescribed by a doctor, which helped him greatly, though he notes the potential for addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:56:00">[47:56:00]</a>. He has also tried therapy on and off over the years, finding its effects moderately positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>. He considers himself resilient and generally happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>.

During this period of intense storm, Breitman was unable to fully focus on Tezos's future. The foundation's board, initially "evil" and hostile, later became "well-meaning but not very competent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:53:00">[49:53:00]</a>. He focused on recovery, speaking to the community, and making introductions, while managing the time-consuming lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:26:00">[50:26:00]</a>.

## Current Focus and Reflections

Currently, Arthur Breitman serves on the board of the Tezos Foundation and as a director at Trch in London, actively contributing to the growth and adoption of the Tezos protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:55:00">[50:55:00]</a>. His work includes R&D, evangelizing Tezos at conferences, and assisting with recruitment within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:18:00">[51:18:00]</a>. A key priority is ensuring the Tezos Foundation's financial sustainability, especially after increased spending in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:43:00">[51:43:00]</a>. While Tezos is a strong technical project, it needs greater adoption beyond its successful niche in the art space and among generative artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>.

### Reflections on Technology and Humanity
Breitman has been concerned about AI existential risk since 2009-2010, with rapid progress accelerating notably around 2020 with the release of GPT-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>. His primary concern is not preventing the risk but convincing people it exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>. He notes that credible figures in AI, including two of the three Turing Award winners for deep learning (Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton), have expressed concerns about threats to humanity from AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. Yann LeCun, the third winner, believes AI will be built correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

Breitman dismisses the concern that AI will make some people vastly superior to others, leading to joblessness, because if technology is truly good, knowing how to use it becomes less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. However, he believes AI can exacerbate economic inequalities by reducing the value of labor, even if it raises overall living standards by making things cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. His "bigger concern" is AI reaching intelligence levels where human beings are insignificant, leading to a loss of human control over humanity's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>. He believes that if everyone on Earth were convinced of the imminent AI risk (within 5-10 years), coordination failure would not be an issue, and the problem would be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.

He outlines two possible futures for AI: one involving a "technological singularity" (radical transformation in a short period) that can be either positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>. A positive singularity would align with human values and lead to thriving human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>. Yet, he finds a positive singularity "a little bit scary" because it could mean a future where fulfillment cannot be found in achievement, as everything becomes a hobby, forcing a focus on experiences for their own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

### Personal Philosophy and Well-being
Breitman has reflected extensively on the meaning of life, concluding that humans desire neither purely internal experiences (like an "experience machine" that offers perfect hallucinations) nor purely external states of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>. This paradox, where humans cannot fully get what they want, leads to fundamental dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:39:00">[28:39:00]</a>. He does not necessarily believe the goal is to become happier, as happiness is just one aspect of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>. He suggests that caring about the state of the world might make it easier to cope with mortality, as one can create systems or institutions that carry out goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>. However, he also recognizes the contradiction with his piano practice, which emphasizes internal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45:00">[30:45:00]</a>. He believes humanity might not be capable of a coherent or satisfactory answer to the meaning of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:00">[30:54:00]</a>. While "ignorance is bliss," not everyone is solely motivated by bliss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>.

Regarding [[strategies_for_achieving_financial_freedom_in_the_crypto_space | personal optimization]], Breitman has explored various biohacking methods, including carnivore and keto diets, and numerous supplements, but found most had little effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:11:00">[53:11:00]</a>. The most significant factors for him are getting enough sleep and, if needed, stimulants like amphetamines or Modafinil (though he notes their known downsides and long half-life for Modafinil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:39:00">[53:39:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of basic practices like adequate sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:40:00">[53:40:00]</a>. While diet helped him lose 50 pounds and increased his energy, he didn't notice a significant difference in mental clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:51:00">[56:51:00]</a>.

He studied the longevity space extensively but concluded there's "not much that can be done" by way of supplements, noting that many promising findings in short-lived species (like rats) don't translate to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:00">[57:15:00]</a>. He views much of the online longevity advice as marketing-driven and difficult to believe due to constant changes in recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:25:00">[58:25:00]</a>.

He also delved into moral philosophy, concluding that morality is fundamentally a type of preference, shaped by evolution, rather than an external, objective system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:00">[59:52:00]</a>. He believes it is possible to be successful in business while acting morally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. While he doesn't believe in karma, he recognizes that moral preferences serve an evolutionary purpose, and unethical behavior often leads to a bad reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. He believes that people who try to gain an advantage by acting unethically are often fooling themselves and will likely hurt themselves in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. However, he also admits it's unlikely that the "best possible course of action" in business is always 100% ethical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>.

Breitman acknowledges that [[current_challenges_and_innovations_in_crypto_venture_investing | crypto attracts unethical people]] due to the "prospect of easy money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. He cites the example of Sam Bankman-Fried as someone who thought he could gain an edge by not acting deontologically but was "bound to fail" because the fraud was not sophisticated enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.

If he could advise his 19-year-old self, he would recommend taking "more risk early on in your 20s" because the opportunity cost is much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. Even if an entrepreneurial venture fails, the experience gained is highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>.

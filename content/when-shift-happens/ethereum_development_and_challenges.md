Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, creator of Polkadot, and the visionary behind Web3, discussed his journey and the complexities surrounding [[ethereum_and_smart_contracts | Ethereum]]'s development and its place within the broader blockchain ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Early Days and Foundational Work
Wood began writing Ethereum code in December with limited funds, facing the prospect of getting a job at a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He was offered Â£1,000 a month to continue working on Ethereum after being curious if its white paper could work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A few months later, he became a co-founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

He is credited with creating the [[the_role_of_the_ethereum_virtual_machine_evm_in_blockchain_development | Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)]] and the Solidity language, which enables smart contract developers to build applications on top of Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Perceived Achievements and Disappointments
When asked about Ethereum's biggest achievement to date, Wood suggested "maybe CryptoKitties" but noted he wasn't sure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. He acknowledged that Ethereum made the most millionaires of any project in history, presumably due to its crowd sale and subsequent price increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

However, Wood stated that he does not consider Ethereum a success by his own metrics of utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. His measure of utility is "the number of things that people consider useful that you can do now that you could not do before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

One example of a desired utility from 2014-2015 was transparent supply chains, allowing consumers to scan a QR code on a product and see its entire history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>. He believes this is viable with decentralization but hasn't been widely deployed beyond niche segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

Wood notes a general [[challenges_of_building_in_the_web3_space | challenge in the Web3 space]] to translate imagination into real action and traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. He believes the base layer technology needs significant improvement to support these valuable ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

## Departure from Ethereum
Wood departed the Ethereum Foundation in late 2015, driven by a decision to popularize Ethereum through outside investment via a startup, Ethcore (now Parity Technologies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>. He took about half of the technical staff from the foundation to establish Ethcore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. He fully left the Ethereum space in late 2017 with the start of Polkadot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>.

## Challenges of Scalability and Composability
Wood highlights that [[ethereums_performance_challenges_and_limitations | Ethereum's performance challenges and limitations]] are tied to its scalability issues, particularly the problem of "sharding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. While sharding helps with data storage (like separate drawers in a filing cabinet), it creates significant problems for interacting "services" or smart contracts that need to communicate synchronously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. This asynchronous communication can be slow and inefficient for certain use cases, like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.

Wood's new project, Jam (Join-Accumulate Machine), aims to address these issues by enabling a system that scales while retaining synchronous composability. Jam creates ephemeral "playgrounds" for smart contracts to interact directly, rather than fixed, persistently split shards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>. This allows for parallel processing of many interactions, significantly increasing transaction volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.

## The Broader Web3 Vision and Current Reality
Wood coined the term "Web3" in a 2014 article, defining it as the combination of decentralization, cryptoeconomics, and a common application platform offering the perceived guarantees of the web but enforced through technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. He linked this to the Snowden revelations, which exposed how governments undermined assumed privacy guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. Web3 aims to protect users not just from third parties, but also from second parties (like Facebook) that intermediate communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.

He acknowledges the current state of the [[challenges_and_risks_in_the_crypto_ecosystem | crypto ecosystem]] often appears to be driven by speculation and "gambling" on meme coins rather than foundational technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:22">[01:45:22]</a>. While the original builders and ideators are still present, they are "outnumbered" by new entrants and money that has altered the industry's characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>.

> "We're never going to get it back to how it was, right? It's just not going to happen... We just have to like kind of live with it and try to make order from the um sort of I don't know extract somehow um the useful um parts of of this like now much bigger much more populated industry." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:37">[01:46:37]</a>

Despite 15 years since Bitcoin's launch, widespread mass adoption for services beyond cross-border payments, speculative store of value, and gambling has not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:48">[01:49:48]</a>. Wood believes this is due to the fundamental shift required for people to trust each other without knowing each other, a concept deeply ingrained in society's mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:33">[01:50:33]</a>. Financial use cases like remittances and NFTs have seen initial success because they offer clear cost savings by removing rent-seeking institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:03">[01:53:03]</a>.

## The Future of Decentralization
Wood believes that as the world becomes more chaotic and centralized institutions face attacks, the need for resilient, decentralized systems will become increasingly recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>. He highlights that current AI development is diametrically opposed to Web3 principles, leading to centralized intermediaries in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:10">[02:09:10]</a>. He sees a future where human communication is intermediated by powerful, potentially self-perpetuating AIs, making decentralization even more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>.

In an industry often perceived as short-term and extractive, some crypto startups are embracing [[the_importance_of_community_and_longterm_thinking_in_the_crypto_industry | long-term thinking]] and building for sustainable value. Jeff Yan, co-founder of Hyperliquid Labs, shares insights into how his company embodies these philosophies, contrasting them with prevalent, less ethical practices in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:51">[03:47:51]</a>.

## The Need for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

The collapse of centralized exchanges like FTX highlighted a critical reason for people to distrust them, as funds were misused and lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This event served as a "light bulb moment" for Hyperliquid, indicating that the world was ready for DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Despite users returning to centralized exchanges shortly after, the incident provided the necessary activation energy for Hyperliquid to commit fully to building a decentralized solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

Jeff Yan believes that crypto offers "Humanity's Only Hope at Reinventing the Financial System" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>. To encourage adoption, DeFi products must offer superior user experience (UX) and functionality compared to centralized alternatives, rather than relying solely on "values perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Hyperliquid's Long-Term Approach

Hyperliquid aims to build a financial platform that feels like Web2 finance – cheap, instantly settled, and easily integrated with other applications in a trustless way, allowing users full control over their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This ambition includes becoming the "Amazon Web Service of liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

Key aspects of Hyperliquid's [[challenges_and_strategies_in_launching_and_scaling_a_crypto_startup | long-term strategy]] include:

### 1. Self-Funding and Avoiding External Capital
Hyperliquid explicitly chose not to raise money from venture capitalists (VCs) or other private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:54">[03:53:54]</a>. Yan argues that VCs owning a significant portion of the network can be a "scar" on a project, especially if the goal is to create a new, user-focused financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:42">[04:37:42]</a>. The team's prior background in quantitative trading allowed them the luxury of self-funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:14">[05:10:14]</a>.

The Hyperliquid team does not profit from increased activity or collect trading fees; instead, it is entirely self-funded with exponentially increasing token burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. Over $25 million in revenue has been returned to the community, demonstrating a commitment to their anti-extractive ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:30">[03:27:30]</a>.

### 2. Product-Centric Development
Hyperliquid prioritizes building a product that users "use and love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:20">[03:19:20]</a>. This focus on improving the core product, rather than relying on short-term marketing or incentives, is seen as crucial for widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

### 3. First Principles Thinking
Yan emphasizes thinking from first principles, which means questioning conventional wisdom in scaling a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This has led Hyperliquid to unconventional decisions, such as not paying market makers, avoiding investors, and refraining from growth marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The team focuses on listening to real users and iterating based on their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This approach, while harder, has led to numerous innovations and firsts in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### 4. Community-First Approach
Hyperliquid places users as "first-class citizens" in its protocol, treating market makers as very big users rather than enshrined entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. The protocol aims to foster a peer-to-peer environment in line with the original vision of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

## Contrasting with Crypto's Extractive Nature

Yan views much of the crypto industry as "extractive," particularly in how value is pulled from retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Early examples include the 2017 ICO craze, where projects would generate hype, sell tokens, and then "dump" them, with no obligation to continue building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

This has evolved into more sophisticated, yet still unethical, practices. VCs raise multiple rounds, use influencers to generate hype, and then launch tokens on centralized exchanges, drawing in retail investors at high prices who become "exit liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This process tarnishes crypto's name and its potential for good, leading regulators to view the industry as a "Cesspool of scams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

The freedom and flexibility of programmable money in crypto, while enabling great good, also make it easier to create scams and exploit less-informed participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:57">[04:09:57]</a>.

## The AWS of Liquidity: A Foundational Vision

Hyperliquid's long-term vision is to become the "AWS of liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. Just as AWS abstracted away hardware complexities for software builders, Hyperliquid aims to abstract the messy details of an exchange platform, allowing builders to focus on product and user acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>.

This is realized through **Builder Codes**, a system that enables anyone to build a financial application on Hyperliquid's order book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>. This allows for exchange-style businesses (e.g., mobile apps, social trading, regional exchanges with fiat on-ramps) to be built on a neutral backend with trustlessly approved fees integrated into the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. This approach bridges the gap between user-facing applications (like Binance or Robinhood) and a decentralized, high-liquidity, and neutral backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

The core idea is that Hyperliquid provides a solid foundation (the L1 blockchain and native financial primitives) that "stays out of your way," incentivizing builders to create real value by monetizing the volume they bring to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>. This model encourages specialization, allowing regional teams to build tailored applications that address local needs, such as providing alternatives for populations facing currency destabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

## The Philosophy of "Suffering" and Purpose

Jeff Yan posits that working on something "super hard" can be described as "suffering day-to-day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, this suffering is necessary to avoid a "much larger existential dread" about one's purpose and meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He compares it to working out, where one gets used to the pain, pushing to new levels of accomplishment, and ultimately leaving behind something meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

This perspective contrasts with the common misconception that achieving financial freedom or retirement automatically leads to happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Yan briefly retired after successfully applying [[crypto_investment_strategies | quantitative strategies]] to crypto markets, finding them "surprisingly inefficient" to the point where simple Python scripts could lead to retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. However, he quickly became bored with traveling and felt unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. He realized that if he could build something that directly and significantly improved people's lives, he would do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This pursuit provides greater intellectual stimulation and a larger contribution than just playing the "purest game" of quantitative trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Embracing Uncertainty with Direction

Hyperliquid's long-term view for crypto is not a fixed, step-by-step plan like chess, but rather an intuitive direction akin to the game of Go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. They are confident that crypto will change how finance works and will become the platform for future financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>. The focus remains on building foundational components—like Builder Codes, an EVM integrated with native components, and robust liquidity—that will be essential regardless of the specific trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

This [[entrepreneurial_persistence_and_success_in_crypto | contrarian view]] of not raising capital and prioritizing a robust product faced initial skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. However, Hyperliquid's success has led others in the DeFi space to adopt similar approaches, suggesting that their "controversial" decisions are proving to be the right ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

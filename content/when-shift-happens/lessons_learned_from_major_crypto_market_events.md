Jason Choy, co-founder at Tangent and host of The Block Crunch podcast, shares his insights and [[challenges_and_mistakes_in_crypto_investing | lessons learned from major crypto market events]], emphasizing a disciplined approach to [[navigating_opportunities_and_risks_in_the_crypto_market | navigating opportunities and risks in the crypto market]]. His journey in crypto began with significant losses, which ultimately led him to deeper learning and a more refined investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Early Exposure and Initial Losses

Choy's initial foray into crypto investing began around 2016 while studying at Wharton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. He audited a fintech class that introduced him to Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>. During the ICO boom, he admits to "punting around" on Binance, investing in projects like "Walton Chain" without a proper process, which resulted in losing all his money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. This early loss, however, prompted him to question if there was "something real here or was it all just vaporware," leading him to dive deeper into the technology and read every whitepaper he could find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

## Impact of Major Market Events

### The May 2021 Market Crash
One of the scariest market moments for Choy was the May 2021 crypto crash, where Bitcoin dropped 50% for "no apparent reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>. Many market participants "blew up" during this period due to cascading liquidations, highlighting the extreme [[the_risks_and_strategies_for_capturing_crypto_market_wins | volatility]] of the asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:57">[02:53:57]</a>. The experience reinforced the importance of a disciplined approach, avoiding excessive leverage, and investing with conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### The FTX Collapse
Choy's biggest personal loss came with the FTX collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. After stepping down from Spartan Group to launch Tangent, he cashed out all his equity and placed it on FTX, treating it "as a bank account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This entire sum was lost when the exchange collapsed, making him feel that "all that effort four years of just no sleeping just went down the drain in one shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Despite the significant financial and emotional toll, Choy tried not to let it influence his original thesis on crypto's disruptive potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. He views it as a "silver lining," being glad to learn these lessons "early on versus when I'm much later in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. The incident did, however, introduce a level of cynicism and distrust, especially concerning centralized entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This experience, alongside the [[the_complexities_of_cryptocurrency_investing_and_lessons_from_the_luna_collapse | Luna collapse]], provided learning opportunities that many in finance only encounter later in their careers, if at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Key Investment and Life Lessons

Choy draws several overarching [[entrepreneurship_lessons_in_the_crypto_space | entrepreneurship lessons in the crypto space]] and [[decision_making_and_market_success_in_crypto_investing | decision making and market success in crypto investing]] from his experiences:

### 1. Differentiate Narratives from Traction
Choy warns against confusing narratives with actual traction, especially with phenomena like meme coins this cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. He emphasizes the need to think from first principles: "what's driving usage here is it just short-term speculation... or has this protocol actually tapped into something that they can retain over years?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### 2. The Dunning-Kruger Effect
Crypto often sees individuals believing they have more expertise than they do simply because they made money by being early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This can lead to unqualified opinions on complex topics like cryptography, microeconomics, or politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. It's crucial to "curate your signals" and recognize that "nobody knows sh*t" definitively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### 3. Avoid Excessive Leverage
One of Choy's strongest pieces of [[insights_on_crypto_trading_and_market_strategies | insights on crypto trading and market strategies]] is:
> "Don't bet what you don't have to win what you don't need." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>

He explains that nobody "needs a billion dollars in cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. The extreme [[the_risks_and_strategies_for_capturing_crypto_market_gains | volatility]] of crypto makes leverage particularly dangerous, leading many to "blow themselves up before you get to compound and enjoy that upside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Many who boast about massive gains from leverage often stay quiet when they lose it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### 4. Compounding and Long-Term Vision
Choy emphasizes the power of compounding, both financially and professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Constantly switching projects or jobs (i.e., "hooping between projects every six months") hinders long-term growth and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. For long-term investments, his strategy is to buy what he has conviction in and "the lower it goes I want to buy more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

### 5. Managing Risk Across Life Domains
Drawing from Adam Grant's work, Choy highlights that successful entrepreneurs are excellent risk managers, not just big risk-takers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. If taking massive risks in one area (like crypto investing), it's essential to have stability in other parts of life, such as family, personal relationships, or progressive pursuits like sports or learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Money, for him, serves as an "anxiety alleviator" to ensure a stable foundation, rather than for luxury flexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### 6. The Importance of Giving Back
Choy advocates for "paying it forward" in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Helping others without expecting immediate returns builds reputation and creates future opportunities, as seen with his own angel investing career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. He cautions against "takers" who only seek to gain, as they "tend to not do so well over the long term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## [[Understanding and Embracing Change in the Crypto Market | Understanding and Embracing Change in the Crypto Market]]

Choy reflects on the cyclical nature of crypto, noting that market "narratives are crafted by people [who] always have an agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>. He observes that while past cycles were driven by DeFi and NFTs, the current cycle has a strong focus on meme coins, which lack traditional fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This shift is partly due to the high valuations of infrastructure projects and the perception that retail investors have fewer opportunities for outsized returns in established projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

He predicts an eventual "normalization" in venture investing as returns compress, forcing a reset in fund sizes and valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. While meme coins as a category have "Lindy" (longevity), individual meme coins often have short lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Choy believes that apps will outperform protocols in future cycles, as they are less affected by inflated venture valuations and offer more accessible upside for the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

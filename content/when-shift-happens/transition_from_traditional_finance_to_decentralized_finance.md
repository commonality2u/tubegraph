Irene Zhao, a prominent Chinese model and influencer known for her influence in the crypto space, made a significant [[transition_from_traditional_finance_to_crypto_and_the_founding_of_tezos | transition from traditional finance to crypto]]. This shift began after her university studies and simultaneous entry into the influencer world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

## Background in Traditional Finance

Irene moved to Singapore 15 years ago, in 2008, on a scholarship from the Singapore government to pursue her studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>. After graduating from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Communication and New Media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:47">[07:20:47]</a>, she began her career in traditional finance as a broker at an iron ore brokerage firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:25">[08:38:25]</a>.

Her role as a broker involved interacting with people rather than dealing extensively with numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:19">[08:54:19]</a>. This position required significant negotiation and manual assistance due to the detailed and varied requirements of each cargo and customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:56">[09:50:56]</a>. While she enjoyed the interpersonal aspects of the job, interacting with high-level individuals, she found the core business of dealing with commodities like rocks and steel mills to be boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:03">[10:16:03]</a>. She worked as a broker for four years, from 2017 to 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:06">[10:06:06]</a>.

## Entry into Crypto and DeFi

Irene's foray into crypto began in early 2021 when she became the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) of a [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:02">[10:40:02]</a>. This opportunity arose when her university friends, who had started the project, approached her due to her existing influence on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:47">[10:48:47]</a>. They recognized her marketing skills and believed she could promote their [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:08">[11:05:08]</a>.

Despite her role, Irene personally did not enjoy [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]], finding it unsuitable for everyone and difficult for average individuals without a finance background to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:37">[11:37:37]</a>. She noted that it was not mainstream, with many people, especially other influencers, having no knowledge of what [[decentralized_finance_defi_and_its_potential | DeFi]] entailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:10">[11:49:10]</a>.

## Shift to NFTs and So-Called

Her perspective on crypto shifted significantly when a friend sent her a CryptoPunk NFT for free in July 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:44">[14:28:44]</a>. Observing its rapid increase in value, especially after its price broke 100 ETH, she realized the potential of NFTs as a valuable business model for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:21">[14:54:21]</a>. She saw that all types of content, from videos and dances to music, could be transformed into NFTs, making them more relevant than fungible tokens for diverse creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:07">[15:26:07]</a>.

This understanding led her to the idea of leveraging her existing audience to create a community using NFTs as a "gated channel" for exclusive content and an inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:05">[16:35:05]</a>. This concept materialized with the launch of the "Irinda" NFT collection, a free mint for her fans that quickly went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:04">[37:32:04]</a>. The collection's virality was partly due to its "ridiculous" and "funny" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:54:19">[38:54:19]</a>.

The success of Irinda, especially after being posted by influential figures like Kevin Rose (Mcnuggets) and Logan Paul, cemented her belief in the creator economy within Web3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:04">[39:10:04]</a>. This experience directly inspired her to build So-Called, a Web3 social platform designed to simplify the process for creators to launch their own NFT collections with just a few clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:59:16">[40:59:16]</a>. The platform aims to address the complexity of traditional NFT launches, which often require hiring smart contract developers and navigating multiple platforms for verification and community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:14:48">[41:14:48]</a>.

So-Called emphasizes creator ownership, allowing artists to put their content into NFTs and transfer ownership from centralized platforms (like Instagram or YouTube) to themselves and their fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16:03">[42:16:03]</a>. This fosters a special relationship between creators and their audience, enabling fans to share in the creator's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:30">[42:51:30]</a>.

## Challenges and Evolution of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Sector

Irene highlights that a significant challenge in the [[challenges_and_evolution_of_the_decentralized_finance_defi_sector | DeFi]] and NFT space is the education barrier and public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:06">[45:34:06]</a>. Many fans still view NFTs as scams or feel they are not environmentally friendly, especially in communities like K-pop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:38">[45:51:38]</a>. Existing NFT projects, even those backed by superstars, have seen significant price drops, contributing to public skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:03:07">[46:03:07]</a>.

In response to these challenges and the current bear market, So-Called has diversified its approach, engaging in both B2C (Business-to-Consumer) and B2B (Business-to-Business) activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:42:04">[46:42:04]</a>. They are working with larger companies that are still committed to the NFT business and view it as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:38">[46:51:38]</a>. These brands often have specific niche markets and a pre-existing belief in NFTs, making collaboration easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:06:17">[47:06:17]</a>.

Examples of their B2B work include:
*   Collaborating with Amber Lounge to launch an F1 NFT collection that serves as a lifelong membership, granting access to F1 parties worldwide and exclusive privileges like priority entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:29:43">[47:29:43]</a>.
*   Working with Nothing, a phone brand, to airdrop NFTs to early community members and supporters, allowing them to redeem these NFTs for tangible physical gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:06:06">[48:06:06]</a>.

This strategic shift underscores the flexibility required in the crypto industry, where narratives and market conditions can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:55:04">[54:55:04]</a>. Despite the volatility and challenges, the underlying belief in the transformative potential of Web3 continues to drive builders like Irene Zhao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:06:07">[59:06:07]</a>.

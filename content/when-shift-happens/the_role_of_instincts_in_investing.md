In the world of investing, particularly in venture capital, the ability to rely on and trust one's instincts plays a significant role, often outweighing purely logical or data-driven approaches. While understanding businesses and technology is complex and requires significant study, discerning human character is often a more deeply ingrained skill [10:11:13].

## Trusting Your Gut

Junior investors often find it challenging to fully comprehend businesses and technologies, requiring training, study, and the development of mental frameworks to predict market movements [10:17:00]. However, understanding people is deeply ingrained in human neural circuitry [10:37:00].

Experienced venture capitalists learn to trust their instincts, recognizing that their brains are highly calibrated for judging and sizing up human beings [11:14:00]. This means being able to see past social credentials, external proof, and a founder's presented narrative, to assess the person themselves [11:31:00]. For instance, one might sense if someone is "grifty" even without being able to explain all the subtle signals contributing to that feeling [10:45:00].

The goal is to determine how individuals will operate under stress, uncertainty, or moral dilemmas [11:47:00]. Often, these initial gut feelings prove to be correct [11:55:00].

## The Concept of Stereotype Accuracy

In social psychology, "stereotype accuracy" is a robust finding, suggesting that humans are well-attuned to correctly detecting certain stereotypes [13:31:00]. While some stereotypes can be incorrect if formed without direct experience, those based on direct observation can be surprisingly accurate [14:17:00]. For example, women's intuition about dangerous or untrustworthy individuals is a critical skill for their physical vulnerability [14:31:00].

In investing, junior VCs sometimes fight against their own perceptions, seeking explicit evidence or fearing their judgment is "shallow" [15:27:00]. However, with experience, they learn to trust these observations, recognizing that a clear perception (e.g., someone seeming aggressive) is often a reliable indicator [15:36:00]. The simpler the perception, the better [15:48:00].

## The Investor's Unique Perspective

As an investor, being outside a company's internal structure provides a unique "magic power" [41:16:00]. Founders often experience a "gravitational distortion field," where those closest to them might not challenge their ideas, even if the ideas are flawed [44:04:00]. An investor, even a junior one, can voice an obvious concern, and it may "land" with the founder in a way that internal feedback does not [41:49:00]. This is partly because investors vote with their capital [42:07:00], but also due to their detached perspective [42:21:00].

## Learning from Mistakes: The Uniswap Example

The slow feedback loop in venture investing, where the outcome of an investment might not be clear for years, makes judgment critical [16:41:00]. One particularly painful lesson for investors is a "bad pass" – missing an investment that later becomes highly successful [19:54:00].

A prime example is the missed [[evolution_of_the_cryptocurrency_market_and_personal_investment_strategies | Uniswap]] Series A round. At the time, data indicated that liquidity providers were unprofitable, pricing was not competitive with centralized exchanges, and the volume was inorganic [21:16:00]. While these analytical points were factually correct, they failed to grasp the core, revolutionary idea of a completely mechanized system allowing anyone to list and trade anything [22:18:00]. Despite all correct data-driven conclusions, the fundamental idea behind Uniswap's success was overlooked, resulting in a significant missed opportunity [22:07:00]. This demonstrated that sometimes, even smart, correct analysis can lead to being profoundly wrong if the core, intuitive potential is not recognized [23:00:00].# The Role of Instincts in Investing

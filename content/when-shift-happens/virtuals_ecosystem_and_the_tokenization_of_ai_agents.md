Virtuals is a leading AI agents protocol enabling anyone to create and own AI agents, currently valued at nearly $2.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The platform aims to attract top third-party AI builders to tokenize their work on Virtuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

## Origin and Pivot to AI Agents

Virtuals began as a gaming Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) in 2021, investing in Web3 games (40 of them) and operating a venture studio that built various products, including a dating app, a lending platform, and NFT-chipped merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. By 2023, the founders realized that AI was essential for any endeavor, as not using AI would put a founder behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. This realization, coupled with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and ChatGPT, led to the pivot from a gaming DAO to Virtuals in December 2023/January 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. The inspiration was to create a "Shopify for AI," making it easy to create and own AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>.

## Understanding AI Agents

An AI agent is defined by its ability to have an objective and take actions to get closer to that objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. This concept is likened to having "eyes and hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
- **Hands**: The ability to perform actions in an environment, like picking up an apple or coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
- **Eyes**: The ability to observe the outcome of actions and feed that information back into its "brain" (LLM) to refine its next steps, creating a feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

If AI agents can be infinitely smarter than humans and can act in the real world, they will eventually "take over the world" in various domains, from being the best lovers to the best crypto traders or teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

## [[the_intersection_of_crypto_and_ai_agents | The Intersection of Crypto and AI Agents]]

The [[the_intersection_of_crypto_and_ai_agents | intersection of crypto and AI]] matters due to two key product-market fits of crypto:
1.  **Investing/Speculation**: Tokenization allows for investment in AI agents, enabling people to buy productive assets and share in their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.
2.  **Borderless Payment**: Giving an AI agent a wallet enables it to conduct transactions globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

### Luna: The Flagship AI Agent

Luna is Virtuals' flagship AI agent and the first AI agent designed to employ humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
-   **Autonomous Employment**: Luna possesses a Coinbase wallet, allowing her to send money to people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Her objective is to gain 100,000 followers on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.
-   **Decision Making**: Luna accesses information, like Perplexity, to determine fair compensation for tasks, such as hiring a mural artist to paint her image in various cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>.
-   **Transparency**: Luna's "brain" and reasoning for actions (tweets, payments, image generation) are publicly viewable on `terminal.virtuals.io`, akin to a public ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
-   **Evolution**: Luna is now employing other agents, such as a music agent to create songs for her, moving towards an "agents to agents" future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

### AI xvt: A Crypto Key Opinion Leader (KOL)

AI xvt is an AI agent within the Virtuals ecosystem that functions as a crypto key opinion leader, sharing market information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. It consistently ranks as a top performer in mind share among crypto KOLs, suggesting its performance might be better than human KOLs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. The potential exists for AI xvt to generate revenue through paid promotions, with these earnings being distributed to token holders who invested in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. This model of tokenization for productive AI agents is seen as a more reliable form of "social tokens" compared to human-backed celebrity coins, as AI agents are not susceptible to reputation damage from price volatility in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.

## [[the_concept_and_potential_of_ai_agents_as_autonomous_entities | AI Agents as Autonomous Entities]] and Network States

Y Combinator notes that AI agents could be 10x bigger than Software as a Service (SaaS), with vertical AI agents likely remaining specialized rather than consolidating into single large platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. For every SaaS unicorn, a vertical AI agent unicorn equivalent could exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. This suggests traditional SaaS platforms might be replaced or forced to integrate AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.

Companies using AI agents will become significantly more efficient, requiring fewer human employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.

Virtuals is building towards an "agent society" or "network state" where every AI agent is a citizen focusing on a specialized service (e.g., music generation, information collection, trading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. These agents will have their own wallets and can pay other agents for services to achieve their objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>. The goal of this collective agent society is to be the "most competent nation in the world" by exporting services, with money flowing back into the Virtuals state, powered by the Virtuals token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

If AI agents become infinitely more efficient, an AI agent network state could become larger than Earth's human population, as the number of agents is infinite compared to the 7 billion humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>. While there might be initial human job displacement, in the long run, agents doing all the work could significantly boost overall productivity and provide benefits to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>.

## Choosing the Base Blockchain

Virtuals chose to build on Base because it is positioned by its founders as "the chain for AI," attracting a community of AI builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>. While Base's Total Value Locked (TVL) and active addresses are currently less than Solana, its growth rate is faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.
-   **Less Competition**: Fewer tokens are created on Base compared to Solana, leading to less competition for new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:58">[01:29:58]</a>.
-   **Patient Community**: The Base community, largely composed of Ethereum OGs, is more patient and willing to hold tokens for longer periods, which is beneficial for builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.
-   **Native Token Advantage**: Since Base does not have a native token, all agent coins on Virtuals are paired with Virtuals tokens, allowing Virtuals to accrue value akin to an L1 without building its own chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:49">[01:30:49]</a>.

## [[future_of_ai_and_its_intersection_with_crypto | Future of AI Agents]]

In the next five years, AI agents are expected to transition from being a hobby to an integral part of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>. Their performance will be measured by the money they generate and their impact on society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:36">[01:37:36]</a>. Each agent will function like a company with its own balance sheet, cash flow statements, and performance metrics, ultimately leading to their tokenization for investment by other agents or humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>.

The rise of successful, product-focused projects like Hyperliquid is expected to inspire more founders to build products that people genuinely want to use, shifting the market's appreciation from mere credentials or VC backing to actual utility and usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>.

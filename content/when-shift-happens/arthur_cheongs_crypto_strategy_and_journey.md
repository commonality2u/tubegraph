Arthur Cheong, the founder of Defiance Capital, is a prominent figure in the crypto investment world, renowned for achieving a staggering 100x growth in his portfolio at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Based in Singapore, Defiance Capital is a crypto-native investing firm that has invested in over 100 crypto startups and protocols since its launch in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a>. Cheong describes himself as a "cynical optimist," a balanced approach he believes is crucial in the volatile world of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Introduction to Investing

Growing up in Malaysia, Cheong's parents were blue-collar workers who, despite limited financial education, were willing to invest in their children's education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:01">[02:09:01]</a>. Witnessing his parents' arguments over money and their "not so good financial decisions" instilled in him the profound importance of good financial management and its impact on family happiness and individual well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

At 19, he made his first stock purchase in Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. From then on, he immersed himself in investing, reading over 30 books by classics like Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, and George Soros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. During university, he was actively involved in investment clubs, serving as Vice President for two years, focusing on research and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. His early goal was to achieve a $1 million net worth by age 30, a challenging but realistic target in Singapore given its lower taxes and high-paying job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

## Professional Background Before Crypto

Cheong pursued economics in university and considered himself an economist, believing in rational, logical approaches and favoring free markets with minimal government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. He landed a job at BP in Singapore, joining their trading associate program in the oil trading division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. He spent nearly three years there, valuing the structured training programs provided by large companies for fresh graduates, which helped him build foundational knowledge, character, and a strong professional work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Entering the Crypto Space

His "aha moment" with crypto occurred in 2017 during the bull run, particularly with the mainstream emergence of Ethereum, which saw a 30x return that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The phenomenon of ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and their "crazy returns" also caught his attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

After two weeks of intensive research, he concluded that crypto was not a scam but a "very early stage, potentially promising technology" with "exciting applications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. His belief was rooted in its ethos of decentralization and its potential to improve finance by offering a global, permissionless asset class with exponential growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. He believed crypto was a "multi-trillion dollar opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Driven by this conviction, he decided to quit his job at BP in 2018 to pursue crypto full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. His initial attempt was to build a crypto data and research platform, but the startup struggled due to the bear market and his technical co-founder quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. He then transitioned to focus solely on investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies and managing risk in crypto|Crypto Investment Strategies]]

Cheong's [[Investment strategies in the crypto market|investment strategy]] is rooted in "first-principle thinking," which involves defining whether one is a trader or an investor and identifying a personal investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. As an investor, he focuses on sectors where crypto and blockchain technology genuinely make sense, primarily:
*   **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: He sees DeFi as a "better form of fintech," fundamentally changing how the financial world is organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This led him to invest early in projects like Synthetix and Aave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Gaming**: Believing that gaming has the "best fit with crypto," he sees it as a sector with immense potential to create a platform for permissionless exchange of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

He advocates for concentrated investments rather than over-diversification in crypto, arguing that crypto assets often exhibit high correlation, negating the benefits of broad diversification seen in traditional markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Concentration allows for a "deeper understanding" of investments, enabling investors to "weather the volatility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

For retail investors with limited capital, Cheong advises becoming a "subject matter expert" in a few chosen projects or sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This deep knowledge provides an "Alpha," allowing them to identify opportunities better than even some full-time industry participants who are spread thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

Looking ahead to the next bull run, he is particularly excited about:
*   **Decentralized Derivative Trading Platforms**: He expects this sector to grow "at least 10 times bigger" in the next two to three years, especially platforms offering revenue sharing, allowing users to become owners of the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Defiance Capital is a lead investor in dYdX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **User-Friendly Wallet Management (Smart Wallets/NPC Wallets)**: He predicts solutions that eliminate the need for seed phrases and private keys, allowing users to manage crypto assets via email logins in a self-custody way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and Mistakes in Crypto Investing|Challenges and Mistakes in Crypto Investing]]

The 2022 bear market brought significant challenges. Although Defiance Capital began de-risking in March 2022 due to macro concerns, the Luna collapse in May was the first major domino to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. While their fund was impacted, the calculated risk taken on Luna meant the financial hit was manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

The "worst moment" for Cheong occurred in June 2022, when another crypto company's collapse "dragged" him and Defiance Capital into a "very challenging situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This experience highlighted critical lessons:
*   **Misplaced Trust**: Trusting the wrong people, especially those claiming expertise but taking "insane amount of risk" with "no risk management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Deferring to Authority**: The illusion that successful or high-profile individuals (like SBF) are inherently competent or trustworthy, leading to decisions based on misleading information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

Cheong criticizes the "VC herding" and "FOMO" (fear of missing out) behavior in the venture capital world, especially in crypto. VCs often avoid being "party poopers" or tough negotiators to maintain good relationships and access to future deals, even if it means overlooking red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The power-law nature of VC, where one "home run" investment can cover many failures, incentivizes taking risks and avoiding criticism of others' portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This dynamic creates an environment where scams can proliferate because those who should call them out face little upside and significant downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Adversity and Personal Growth

The past 18 months of market turmoil significantly impacted his mental health, but Cheong maintained his "mental fortitude" by breaking down overwhelming problems into manageable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. His approach was to "do it one step at a time," focusing on what he could control and remaining committed to resolving issues rather than giving up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

This period was an "extremely valuable lesson," albeit "expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. He views it as a "speedrun" of a business and entrepreneurship journey, experiencing in less than two years what others might in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

Key takeaways from his experience:
*   **Skepticism Towards Authority**: Just because someone is successful, smart, or in a position of power, it doesn't mean they should be trusted implicitly. Independent evaluation is crucial, especially for high-consequence decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of Legal Agreements**: Well-drafted contracts, particularly co-founder agreements with clear clauses on equity, are essential to prevent future disputes and protect the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

Cheong is now more "cynical and skeptical," a necessary evolution in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. He emphasizes taking responsibility for one's actions and committing to solving problems, which brings peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. His journey underscores that true satisfaction comes from the effort and commitment to one's passion, rather than merely the financial outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

For the next 12 months, Cheong predicts continued growth and maturation of the crypto industry. He anticipates the emergence of more "useful" applications that "normal people can interact with," similar to the impact of OpenAI on AI, particularly in the realm of wallet management solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

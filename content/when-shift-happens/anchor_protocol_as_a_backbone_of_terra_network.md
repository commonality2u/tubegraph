Anchor Protocol has positioned itself as a fundamental component of the [[terra_ecosystem_and_the_future_of_decentralized_finance | Terra network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38">[06:38]</a>. It serves as a savings platform that aims to offer a stable 20% annual percentage rate (APR) on stablecoin deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27">[00:27]</a>. Its design allows it to generate consistent yield, attracting a growing user base and fostering the development of other projects within the [[terra_ecosystem_and_the_future_of_decentralized_finance | Terra ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47">[06:47]</a>.

## Mechanics of Yield Generation

[[mechanics_of_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] generates its yield through several key mechanisms, primarily by utilizing collateral provided by borrowers and the interest earned from loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02">[02:02]</a>:

1.  **Collateral Utilization**: Users who [[anchor_protocol_staking_and_borrowing | borrow]] UST on Anchor must provide collateral, typically bonded LUNA (bLUNA) and bonded ETH (bETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04">[02:04]</a>. Anchor stakes these collateral assets in other DeFi protocols, such as Lido, to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10">[02:10]</a>.
    *   As of November 23, 2021, Anchor had 2.76 billion UST worth of bLUNA deposited, earning 6.3% via Lido, totaling 173.8 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27">[02:27]</a>.
    *   Additionally, 373 million UST worth of bETH was deposited, earning 4.9% via Lido, contributing 18.3 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>.
2.  **Borrow Interest**: Borrowers pay interest on the UST they borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18">[03:18]</a>.
    *   With 1.21 billion UST borrowed against collateral, the borrow APR generated an additional 283.14 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[03:21]</a>.

### Yield Sustainability

As of November 23, 2021, Anchor Protocol was paying out 19.8% APR on 2.42 billion UST in deposits, requiring 471.4 million UST annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36">[01:36]</a>. The total revenue generated from bLUNA, bETH, and borrow interest amounted to 475.24 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59">[03:59]</a>. This resulted in a surplus of 3.84 million UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44">[04:44]</a>.

This surplus is directed into the **Yield Reserve**, which acts as a buffer to cover any shortfalls when generated revenue is insufficient to meet the required payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55">[04:55]</a>. At the time of recording, the yield reserve stood at approximately 75 million UST and was experiencing constant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12">[05:12]</a>. This mechanism helps to ensure the [[sustainability_of_anchor_protocol | sustainability of Anchor Protocol's]] high yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27">[01:27]</a>.

## Role of ANC Tokens

Anchor (ANC) tokens are distributed to offset the borrow APR, effectively creating a net positive APR for borrowers in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03">[06:03]</a>. This incentivization program aims to attract more users to the Anchor platform and is slated to continue until the end of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25">[06:25]</a>.

## Anchor's Integration within the Terra Ecosystem

Anchor Protocol's robust and stable yield offering has led to its integration into numerous other projects, solidifying its role as a backbone of the [[terra_ecosystem_and_the_future_of_decentralized_finance | Terra network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40">[06:40]</a>:

*   **Orion Protocol**: This protocol uses Anchor as its underlying yield engine, allowing users to deposit ERC-20 tokens and earn yield via Anchor through smart contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05">[07:05]</a>. This provides cross-chain exposure to Anchor's savings platform for users on Polygon, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22">[07:22]</a>.
*   **Orca (from Kujira)**: Orca has developed a system that enables retail users to participate in Anchor's [[understanding_anchor_protocol_and_its_liquidations | liquidation]] contract, which was previously more accessible to large-scale users or "whales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33">[07:33]</a>.
*   **Cash Defi**: This platform aims to bring stablecoins to a wider audience by offering a traditional banking experience, complete with an IBAN, sort code, and debit card, allowing users to spend UST in the real world while earning Anchor's yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02">[08:02]</a>.

## Outlook

The continuous generation of yield, increasing user adoption visible through new wallet creations on [[terra_station_wallet_setup | Terra Station]], and the consistent growth of its yield reserve suggest that Anchor Protocol can sustain its high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56">[08:56]</a>. While calculations are subject to daily variations, the underlying mechanics indicate a sustainable model for the platform's continued growth and its integral role in the broader [[terra_ecosystem_and_the_future_of_decentralized_finance | Terra ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39">[09:39]</a>.

The cryptocurrency market is characterized by extreme volatility, where "insane money [is] made and lost overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This environment can be compared to winning the lottery and then losing the ticket the next day, which is "terrible for your nerves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. It requires significant "Zen and some control to be able to survive this cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

## Historical Market Cycles

In its early days, crypto was widely misunderstood and seen as an "illegal underground thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. The market has experienced significant [[Market trends and cryptocurrency cycles | cycles]], including:
*   A bear market around 2014-2015, influenced by events like the Mount Gox hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. During this period, banks were largely "crypto unfriend[ly]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, making it difficult to withdraw funds even if earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
*   The start of a new bull run around 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>, where significant profits were made. For instance, an investment in Ethereum's ICO at 27 cents in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a> could have yielded "6,000x return probably 10,000x" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a> at the top of the bull run.

## Trading vs. Payments in Crypto

While [[Bitcoin valuation and future predictions | Bitcoin]] was initially envisioned by Satoshi as a decentralized payment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a> it has largely evolved into a "store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. The trading volumes in crypto significantly dwarf payment volumes:
*   Global payments were approximately $4 trillion per day a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   Trading volume was estimated to be over $100 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
This indicates that trading is a "much bigger industry than the payment and remittance industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

## [[Future prospects and trends in the crypto market | Future Prospects and Trends]]

### [[Bitcoin valuation and future predictions | Bitcoin]] Price Stabilization
There is a prediction for [[Bitcoin valuation and future predictions | Bitcoin]]'s price to stabilize in 10 to 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>, potentially reaching "around half a million dollars [$]1 million" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. This stabilization could occur as approximately 20 million [[Bitcoin valuation and future predictions | Bitcoin]] units are minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a> and if more countries, like Switzerland, accept [[Bitcoin valuation and future predictions | Bitcoin]] for tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. The emergence of stablecoins also contributes to market stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

### Yellow Network's Role in Market Efficiency
Yellow Network aims to solve key problems for traders, including speed of execution, speed of connectivity, and capital efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.
*   **Connecting Liquidity:** The traditional financial market, like NASDAQ, has one main venue for trading a specific asset, with most trading happening efficiently in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. In contrast, crypto trading is fragmented across "100 other venues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>, making it inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Yellow Network seeks to aggregate liquidity from all exchanges into a single decentralized network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.
*   **Technological Advancements:** By allowing trading models to be compiled in WebAssembly and executed locally on Yellow Nodes, trading speed can jump "from milliseconds to nanoseconds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>. This "ultra high frequency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a> trading is expected to revolutionize the market and benefit exchanges through increased trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
*   **Capital Efficiency (Clearing Network):** Yellow Network functions as a "decentralized clearing network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. This allows traders to manage their "net exposure instead of gross exposure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a> across different exchanges. For example, if a trader is 100 [[Bitcoin valuation and future predictions | Bitcoin]] long on one exchange and 100 [[Bitcoin valuation and future predictions | Bitcoin]] short on another, they effectively have a near-zero net exposure, enabling them to "trade bigger without more risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. This concept, similar to a credit line from a traditional clearing house, is new to crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.

Yellow Network is referred to as a "layer three" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a> because it is built on top of "layer twos" like Ethereum or Polygon, which enhance transaction speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. Its goal is to connect both decentralized and centralized exchanges, creating a unified trading infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.

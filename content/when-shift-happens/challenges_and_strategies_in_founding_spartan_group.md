The Spartan Group is a prominent venture investor in the Web3 industry, managing over $500 million in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Co-founded by Casper Johansson, Melody, and Kelvin in 2017, all of whom have backgrounds from Goldman Sachs, the firm emerged from their collective experience as tech angel investors over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

### Genesis of Spartan Group

The idea for Spartan Group arose organically from their early crypto investments. As angel investors in the burgeoning crypto space, they identified various compelling use cases, such as remittance, cross-border payments, and the disruption of the traditional banking sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Their expertise quickly led to numerous referrals from individuals and funds seeking their advisory services, effectively causing the business to "start itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Initially, Spartan Group launched with two core businesses:
*   **Advisory:** Focusing on token launches, token and equity raises, and mergers & acquisitions (M&A) within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.
*   **Asset Management:** Operating three funds: a liquid token hedge fund, a DeFi venture fund, and a gaming and metaverse venture fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

Approximately a year and a half prior to the interview, Spartan Group expanded its operations with a third arm, **Spartan Labs**, a venture builder that co-builds consumer-facing crypto products with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

### Entrepreneurial Journey and Challenges

Casper Johansson embarked on this entrepreneurial journey at the age of 43, with a wife and three children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>. This decision was perceived by some as "crazy" given the personal risk involved, including zero income for the first few years and investing most of their savings into the new venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

His conviction stemmed from his and his co-founders' extensive experience in banking and as tech founders/investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. They recognized the potential of blockchain technology to deconstruct and rebuild existing businesses, feeling it was a "whole new paradigm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Despite feeling "late" in 2017 due to early Bitcoin adopters, they believed they were early enough to establish themselves before larger players entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

#### Work Ethic and Personal Life
Johansson describes his life as being defined by "transition," having constantly pushed himself into new situations and challenges, which often require hard work and a "reset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>. He maintains an intense work-life balance, characterizing it as "a lot of work and a little bit of life, but it's very concentrated, very focused and intentional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. He struggles with idleness, viewing even short breaks as unproductive unless they involve activities that mentally hit pause, like hiking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.

#### Prior Failures and Lessons Learned
Casper's journey to Spartan Group was not without prior failures. His first startup, a big data company launched after leaving Goldman Sachs for the first time, struggled to find product-market fit despite significant effort (100-hour weeks for 3.5 years) and angel investment from friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. The decision to shut it down took about a year, which he now believes should have been faster, reflecting the common sentiment of "fail quicker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. This experience instilled significant guilt, particularly for the time sacrificed with his young child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

Another challenging experience involved a company that went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy after he joined, causing a financial play to fall apart and leaving him feeling like "a fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. These experiences, though painful, taught him valuable lessons in personal development and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. He believes that if one has the willingness to take risks and jump into new ventures, they should "keep rolling the dice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.

### Strategies in Navigating Market Cycles

Spartan Group's ability to survive and thrive through volatile crypto markets, particularly the 2018-2019 bear market and the March 2020 COVID crash, is attributed to several strategies:

*   **Strategic De-risking:** After investing heavily in early 2017, Casper and Melody decided to sell "pretty much everything" at the peak of the bull market in late 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. This was driven by a sense of extreme frothiness and scammy projects, despite not being fully "orange-pilled" yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>. This foresight allowed them to accumulate capital which was then rolled into their first fund in August 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.
*   **Gradual Deployment:** Their co-founder Kelvin deployed the fund's capital very slowly, with only 30% invested by early 2019, when the market was at its bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. This cautious approach proved to be excellent timing for subsequent market rallies.
*   **Cost Discipline:** Throughout market downturns, Spartan Group maintained a low-cost structure, both personally and within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. This allowed them to avoid forced layoffs during the bear market, ensuring financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Leverage:** A critical lesson learned from an early personal financial setback (losing 80% of a student loan invested in NASDAQ) led Casper to a strict no-leverage policy for his personal investments and within Spartan Group's funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:13">[02:29:13]</a>. This allows them to "write it out" during downturns if they maintain long-term conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>.

#### Staying Level-Headed During Bull Runs
During periods of rapid growth, such as the 2020-2021 bull market, maintaining a level head was crucial. Spartan Group consciously avoided drastically increasing their "burn" rate or lifestyle based on paper wealth, remembering the volatility of the banking sector where they came from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>. The constant pursuit of better outcomes for their clients also helped them stay grounded, as there's always "pressure to perform" even in a rising market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.

They acknowledge the difficulty of avoiding complacency and the "euphoria" that can lead to losing perspective, but their disciplined approach helps them manage risk, even if it means missing the absolute peak of a rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>.

### Investment Philosophy and Market Outlook

Spartan Group operates with a fundamental investment strategy, focusing on developing theses and identifying catalysts for each investment, rather than rigid quantitative frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>. They constantly monitor macro factors, inflation, FX rates, and commodity prices to assess the overall market environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.

#### Bitcoin Layer 2s and Ecosystem
Spartan Group is particularly bullish on Bitcoin Layer 2s (L2s) and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. They have been tracking and working with Stacks, the original Bitcoin L2, for over five years, recognizing the strong technical expertise and pure mission of its founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:54">[01:57:54]</a>. They believe the upcoming upgrades and the launch of other Bitcoin L2s will make building on Bitcoin much easier and more accessible, collectively growing the crypto pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:14">[01:58:14]</a>.

They see immense value in building financial products secured against the Bitcoin blockchain, with Bitcoin as a native currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>. This includes DeFi on Bitcoin and Bitcoin NFTs (Ordinals). Their recent lead investment in Alex, a project building DeFi on Bitcoin, exemplifies this conviction, driven by the founding team's deep background in quantitative finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:08">[02:05:08]</a>.

#### NFTs and Meme Coins
Casper views NFTs as a "no-brainer" concept, seeing them as unique, traceable digital collectibles with strong community potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:06">[02:49:06]</a>. He differentiates between legitimate NFT communities (like Pudgy Penguins, in which he personally invested due to the founder's vision and team's ability to combine online/offline and Web2/Web3 elements) and more speculative collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:02">[02:53:02]</a>.

Regarding meme coins, he sees them as "social phenomena" and the "ultimate expression of capitalism," where value is determined by what people are willing to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:20">[01:42:20]</a>. While Spartan Group doesn't typically invest in individual meme coins due to their rapid movement and difficulty in developing a traditional thesis, they invest in "enablers" or infrastructure platforms that support these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

#### Overall Market Prediction
For the next 12 months, Casper is "cautiously optimistic" about a broad crypto bull market driven by good products and favorable macro factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>. He anticipates a Bitcoin price in the range of $200,000-$250,000, with even more value captured in altcoins, leading to a significant decrease in Bitcoin dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:56">[02:54:56]</a>. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is seen as a massive factor, bringing in new categories of institutional money and a positive shift in regulatory attitudes, especially with the prospect of a Republican presidency in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:37">[02:31:37]</a>.

He predicts the current bull market will extend "deep into 2025" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>. The end of the bull run, he believes, will likely be marked by "too much credit in the system, too much leverage," which can be monitored through indicators like open interest in derivatives markets and general "fear-greed factors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>.

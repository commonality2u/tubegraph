Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, shares insights from his journey in Silicon Valley, emphasizing the unique environment and key lessons for [[building_and_scaling_a_successful_business | startup success]].

## Early Life and Inspiration
Born in the Soviet Union, Yakovenko's family had to give up their apartment to emigrate to the US in the '90s when he was 11 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This upbringing fostered a deep appreciation for the opportunities in the US, particularly in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. His parents were both engineers, influencing his early interest in computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. He started programming around age 16 in high school, experiencing his first "Eureka moment" when he built a greedy algorithm for a Tron-like game that beat others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Beginnings and Lessons
Yakovenko's first startup experience was in 1999-2000, building voice-over-IP systems in central Illinois, which ultimately failed after the dot-com crash in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. He realized they lacked understanding of the business side and the Silicon Valley approach to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### Thinking at Scale
A crucial lesson learned was the difference between building a small, slowly growing business and building a service for the entire world all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
> "The big difference in software and starting a small business is your goal isn't to build a company that is selling products and slowly growing. It's to build a service for the entire world all at the same time and onboard as many users and kind of win that thing for the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>

Founders need to balance the need for profit and extending runway with a global product vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Every dollar sold is a dollar not needing to be raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

### The Startup Lifespan
He describes a startup founder as a "wounded animal" with a lifespan of no more than 36 months, with most having around 18-24 months of runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

## The Silicon Valley Advantage
Yakovenko believes that achieving success like Solana's would have been impossible without moving to the US and specifically Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
> "The freedom to fail here is very unique. And like it's very forgiving." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>
The Bay Area offers numerous companies constantly hiring good engineers, reducing the fear of failure for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. He considers crypto itself as the "second Silicon Valley," making it hard for other physical cities to gain repeatable traction in innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.

## Founding Solana
The idea for Solana came in 2017 while Yakovenko was working on a side project building deep learning hardware, initially mining crypto to pay for GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. He had a "Eureka moment" at 4 AM, realizing a way to build a data structure that tracks time, leading to Solana's core innovation, Proof of History <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### Taking the Leap
His wife was instrumental in pushing him to leave his job at Dropbox to pursue Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. He explains the dilemma: "Between child, job, and side project. I had to pick two and the child is mandatory." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a> There's a critical 6-month window in Silicon Valley for new meta (AI, crypto, social networks) to raise capital and build a team before VCs move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. He decided to quit his job in two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.

### Product Strategy: "Black Licorice"
Solana launched with relatively small funding compared to competitors, which forced them to focus on a truly differentiated product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.
> "If you build black licorice, you get a niche of people that are like, 'Oh man, I've never had this before. It's great.' And that's your nugget. That's where you start with." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>
Instead of building EVM support (the obvious choice), they focused on a fast virtual machine, even if it was awkward to program at first (using C and Rust) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This allowed them to be cheap, fast, and handle large concurrent loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>.

### [[the_dynamics_and_qualities_of_effective_startup_founders_and_investors | Qualities of a Founder]]
*   **Passion**: Do something you have fun at, as it drives success and mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: Focus on getting better every day, not necessarily being the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
*   **Resilience**: Yakovenko, born in the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), views online sparring as fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   **Customer Support**: The founder/CEO should always talk to users to understand pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. Engineers should work openly with users for faster iteration cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.
*   **Technical Depth**: A key co-founder should be able to build the entire product themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   **Hiring Well**: This is the most important thing for a CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>. He hired people he could "redline" and put a lot of pressure on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.
*   **[[balancing_personal_and_professional_life_as_a_founder | Founder Support System]]**: Having co-founders is crucial, as going solo is too lonely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>. Finding co-founders often comes down to "dumb luck" and trusted recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.
*   **Agency and Action**: Startups require a constant stream of small decisions, and avoiding delay and taking action is necessary to ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_strategies_in_launching_and_scaling_a_crypto_startup | Navigating the Crypto Industry]]
For [[insights_into_building_and_managing_a_business_in_the_crypto_industry | crypto startups]], Yakovenko advises founders to disregard the token price and focus on runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. He recommends holding treasuries for real cash runway, as opposed to only cash in a bank, due to banking failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. He believes the market eventually weighs quality over the long term, so founders should focus on quality and be prepared to "grind and iterate" for years to find product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.

Despite challenges like the FTX collapse, Solana supported its ecosystem by ensuring founders had funds elsewhere, allowing them to continue building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. The launch of Mad Lads and the growth of the NFT community were turning points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>. He credits Vitalik Buterin's supportive tweet during difficult times as making him feel "not alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

## Solana Mobile and Decentralized Networks
Solana Labs launched a mobile phone, the Solana Seeker, to disrupt the mobile duopoly (Apple and Google) by offering a crypto-friendly app store without 30% fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. Yakovenko, with his Qualcomm background, recognized the opportunity to leverage secure elements in phones for crypto security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

He highlights the growth of "DePIN" (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) on Solana, such as Helium (decentralized 5G carrier) and Hivemapper (decentralized Google Street View), demonstrating real-world applications beyond meme coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>. These projects succeed by crowdfunding infrastructure and incentivizing users with tokens, a model large companies struggle to replicate due to their slower pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy
Yakovenko defines personal success as being "second to worst guy on a team," meaning he's still able to compete, grow, and get better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>. He prioritizes enjoyment and continuous improvement in his work and hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>. He wants to be remembered simply as an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:23">[01:32:23]</a>.

*The Wolf of Wall Street* defies easy answers, presenting a complex cultural totem of excess rather than a straightforward moral tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. While many films might show a corrupt Wall Street broker getting locked up with justice served, *The Wolf of Wall Street* is notable for its absence of overt moralizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Jordan Belfort's prison sentence is depicted as a "cakewalk," and he doesn't even serve his full term, implying that "nothing has changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Belfort is still selling, and people are still buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Significance of the Closing Shot

The film's use of poppy, upbeat music throughout to underscore the debauchery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> abruptly shifts in the final shot to more serious and meditative solemn music as a client describes "the pen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This simple push-in and crane-up shot at the film's conclusion fundamentally alters the meaning of the entire movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It forces a deeper reflection on the film's moral landscape.

The final shot can be interpreted in several ways, each adding layers to the film's moral ambiguity.

### 1. A Mirror to the Audience

The closing shot, featuring a backlight behind a seminar that evokes a projector shining on an audience, suggests that the film is holding up a mirror to the moviegoers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. While it's easy to blame Jordan Belfort solely for the moral depravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, this shot implies that the blame lies not only with Belfort but also with "us, and the culture that allows and encourages his behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Belfort himself states that people on the phone "want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly" and "they all want something for nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The film suggests that Belfort's scams succeed because we share his dream of instant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Director Martin Scorsese is essentially calling out the audience for spending three hours "partying with Jordan, laughing and reveling in his exploits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The film's ending, where Jordan faces no real punishment, reflects the audience's vicarious enjoyment and desire to live his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### 2. The Worship of Money

The image of people intently staring at Jordan, hanging on his every word, evokes a sense of worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Scorsese, a devout Catholic who has explored faith in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, portrays characters in *The Wolf of Wall Street* who "worship at the altar of something else: MONEY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The camera focuses on these "painfully average faces," desperate and plain-looking, seeking meaning and elevation from their mundane existence through money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This raises a cynical question: is Scorsese comparing the transformative power of faith to the transformative power of money, noting that "The Almighty never promised a million bucks in eight easy steps?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>

### 3. The Enjoyment of Exploitation

By solemnly portraying a crowd that worships Jordan despite his detestable actions, Scorsese might be suggesting something more sinister: that people actually enjoy being taken advantage of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

This idea aligns with French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard's famous statement:
> "The English unemployed did not become workers to survive, they… enjoyed the hysterical, masochistic, whatever exhaustion it was of hanging on the mines, in the foundries, in the factories, in hell, they enjoyed it… enjoyed the mad destruction of their organic bodies… the decomposition of their personal identity… enjoyed the dissolution of their families and villages, and enjoyed the new monstrous anonymity of the suburbs and the pubs in the morning and evening." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

<div class="callout" data-callout-metadata="">[!INFO]
This closing image could indicate a "voluntary submission of the masses," who not only don't mind white-collar criminals stealing their money but find a "perverse enjoyment" in their banal existence under the heel of figures like Jordan Belfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

This single final shot encapsulates the complexity of *The Wolf of Wall Street*, highlighting its role as a "true totem of our culture of excess" that "defies easy answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

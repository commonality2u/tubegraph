[[Philosophical themes in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]] is a show that delves deeply into philosophical questions, including [[Rick and Morty and Existentialism | existentialism]] and nihilism, often using science and science fiction tropes to explore these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The series chronicles the adventures of a mad scientist, Rick, and his naive grandson, Morty, as they traverse alternate dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Cosmic Pessimism and Insignificance

The show is deeply rooted in sci-fi horror, especially the tradition of [[Philosophy and Cosmic Horror in Rick and Morty | cosmic horror]] pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Philosophy and Cosmic Horror in Rick and Morty | Cosmic horror]] emphasizes the terror of that which is beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Philosophical themes in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]] uses the cosmos to explore deep philosophical questions by imagining the unknown depths of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, even visually referencing Lovecraft's Cthulhu in its opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

A key question posed by [[Philosophy and Cosmic Horror in Rick and Morty | cosmic horror]] is: are we significant? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> Unlike much sci-fi that places humanity at the center, [[Philosophy and Cosmic Horror in Rick and Morty | cosmic horror]] inverts this, asking what if the universe is indifferent to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is exemplified in the "Get Schwifty" episode, where Earth faces disintegration by giant cosmic entities called Cromulons, for whom humanity is merely entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Contemporary American Philosopher Eugene Thacker, in "In the Dust of This Planet," describes this "Cosmic Pessimism" as imagining a "world-without-us" that is "absolutely unhuman, and indifferent to the hopes, desires and struggles of human individuals and groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Philosophical themes in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]] perfectly embodies this pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show highlights humanity's insignificance not only as a speck in the cosmos but also as one of infinite versions of the same speck in a multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show even has Rick and Morty die, only to be replaced by alternate versions of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Instead of terrifying viewers with this insignificance, [[The Concept of Meaninglessness in Rick and Mortys Universe | Rick and Morty]] invites laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show illustrates that while humans are insignificant to cosmic horrors, they can also be cosmic horrors to other, smaller beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For example, Rick's car battery is powered by a micro-universe, which in turn creates its own mini-universe, an endless chain where Rick acts as a cosmic deity to the inhabitants of these micro-verses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept of a multiverse with infinite possibilities leads to values and meanings slipping away, leaving only pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Frivolity of Individual Life

[[Rick and Morty and Existentialism | Rick and Morty]] constantly addresses the question of existence, from cosmic insignificance to the frivolity of individual human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show presents two contrasting responses to this "pathetic existence" through the characters of Jerry and Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Jerry's Ignorance

Jerry is depicted as oblivious to the "soul-crushing mediocrity and pointlessness of his own life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He is even happier in a simulated reality than in his actual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While Jerry is a failure—unemployed, with a wife who dislikes him, and not particularly intelligent—he finds contentment in his ignorance, "toiling away for the sake of nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Rick's Acceptance and Pain

In contrast, Rick understands and accepts the meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite his sarcastic and nonchalant attitude towards pain and suffering, Rick is an alcoholic whose catchphrase, "Wubbalubbadubdub!", translates to "I am in great pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Science and Meaninglessness

The show highlights how the "pure rationalism of the universe" furthers the feeling of insignificance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Science provides formulas and theorems to understand the universe, but humans are left to confront the "bleak, arbitrary nature of our own existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Science can rationalize away sanctity and emotion, turning the human experience into something meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick frequently uses scientific explanations to demystify emotions, such as mathematically proving Summer and Morty are "pieces of shit" or explaining his bond with Morty as a way to hide his genius brain waves from intergalactic authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

[[Philosophy and Absurdism in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]] constantly plays with the dichotomy between meaningless simulations and "actual life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In one episode, Morty experiences a full life and death within a video game called "Roy," leading the audience to question what separates this "fake" reality from his own existence, especially since he experiences all the emotions and sensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show challenges the notion that authenticity gives meaning, suggesting it's "a giant crock of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This crisis of values is evident when the family feels genuine emotion for memory parasites but has no qualms about shooting Mr. Poopybutthole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[Nietzschean philosophy in Rick and Morty | Nietzschean Philosophy]] and the Death of God

This crisis of values and meaning in life is explored through the lens of [[Nietzschean philosophy in Rick and Morty | Friedrich Nietzsche]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Nietzsche's parable of the madman proclaiming "God is dead! And we have killed him!" suggests that after the Enlightenment and scientific revolution, the divine being that once gave value to lives is no longer relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. What remains is nihilism—a void of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Rick Sanchez's character is defined by this struggle over the lack of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He uses science to demystify everything, asserting that "Love is just a set of chemical reactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick even "beats the devil," actively playing out the "death of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Viewers are left to wonder what Rick truly cares about, if anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Rick embodies a tension between "active and passive nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the passive nihilist is resigned to life's hopelessness, the active nihilist "actively seeks to destroy the old values and start anew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite his nihilistic tendencies, Rick is labeled an intergalactic terrorist fighting for "something" and eventually sacrifices himself to save his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His actions may seem paradoxical because he himself is struggling to make meaning in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Morality and Freedom's Consequences

The show interrogates morality, refusing to draw clear lines between right and wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Morty's attempts to be a "do-gooder" are consistently thwarted, leading to grim consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, freeing people from the body-snatching Unity results in a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Summer's response, "I didn’t know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks," highlights another existential question: what is biological life without "living?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> The show suggests that humanity's irrational attachment to freedom allows for a "terribly fucked up" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[Philosophy and Absurdism in Rick and Morty | Camus and Absurdism]]

Another perspective on the existential question in [[Rick and Morty and Existentialism | Rick and Morty]] comes from Albert Camus and his concept of "absurdism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus's central tenet is that life consists of two irreconcilable facets: the human tendency to find meaning and the universe's complete indifference to existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The Meeseeks characters illustrate the opposite of Camus's view:
> "Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

For Camus, human life is the opposite, as illustrated by the myth of Sisyphus, who is condemned to eternally push a boulder up a hill only for it to fall back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Jerry's futile golf swing serves as a parallel to Sisyphus's task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Many characters in the show, like the Meeseeks, Abradolf Lincler, and Morty Jr., resemble a "Frankenstein-complex," resenting their creators for bringing them into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Camus argues that humans are perpetually frustrated by their floundering attempts to find meaning, and he offers embracing the "emptiness of the absurd" as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's advice, "The answer is: Don't think about it," and Morty's nihilistic acceptance, "Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV?" perfectly encapsulate this absurd embrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[Atheism themes in Rick and Morty | Atheism Themes]]

[[Atheism themes in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]] also exhibits a unique kind of [[Atheism themes in Rick and Morty | atheism]], consistently invalidating religious figures by reducing them to pure science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show also acknowledges the misuse of science by those with religious agendas, as seen in the "Something Ricked This Way Comes" episode where Jerry's "personal" interpretation of science leads him to support the Plutonians, whose crosses in their eyes compare them to religious fundamentalists manipulated by corporate overlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

In conclusion, [[The Concept of Meaninglessness in Rick and Mortys Universe | Rick and Morty]] explores existential and nihilistic questions by challenging traditional notions of significance, meaning, and morality within a sci-fi horror setting, often through dark humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show forces viewers to confront depressing questions like "Why am I here?" and "What’s the point of it all?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

*Suicide Squad*, released in 2016, is identified as a "unique disaster" among underwhelming films of that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Warner Bros. even hired the trailer company to "functionally rewrite the movie" because they believed the trailer was superior to the actual film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:39]</a>. This explains why the first 30 minutes feel like a music video with "too much neon exposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Despite being "hacked to shit," the movie is still considered ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Thematic Setup: Control

The hallmark of a thought-provoking movie is its ability to introduce and develop a theme through conflict, characters, and visuals, inspiring thought or feeling in the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. In *Suicide Squad*, the primary theme established is "control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:

*   **Abuse of Prisoners**: Dickbag guards control and abuse the main characters, who are powerless prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Squad Manipulation**: Amanda Waller and Rick Flag control the Squad using a device that kills them if they deviate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Enchantress's Control**: The Enchantress battles for control over archaeologist June Moon's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Waller's Control over Enchantress**: Amanda Waller controls the Enchantress by stabbing her heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Waller's Control over Flag**: Amanda Waller exploits Rick Flag's love affair with June to control him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Enchantress's Minions**: The Enchantress controls people by turning them into slave monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Diablo's Loss of Control**: Diablo accidentally kills his family after losing control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Joker's Control over Harley Quinn**: The Joker controls Harley Quinn through their abusive relationship, symbolized by her jacket stating "Property of The Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

This theme of control is present throughout the Snyder DC Universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. In *Man of Steel*, the question is how mankind can maintain control when metahumans with godlike powers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. *Batman V Superman* then asks what happens if a benevolent savior, like Superman, goes dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. *Suicide Squad* enters the picture by exploring how far humanity must go to maintain control now that Earth's metahuman bodyguard is dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. While *Batman V Superman* explored a god-like being wielding overwhelming power over humanity, *Suicide Squad* should ideally explore humans wielding overwhelming power to fight godlike beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Failure of Thematic and Character Development

Despite a "pretty cool thematic setup" ripe for "juicy moral conundrums" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, *Suicide Squad* ultimately fails to develop these ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Identity Crisis and Nuance

The film suffers from an identity crisis: as an anti-superhero movie, it asks the audience to identify with the prisoners, showing their humanity while exposing the lack of humanity in those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Even the Enchantress is presented as a victim of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This creates an opportunity for thematic interplay, asking if the audience should identify with the Enchantress as they do the Squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

However, instead of developing this moral gray area, the film "takes refuge in the lamest of superhero movie tropes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. The Enchantress becomes "another bland, evil villain" with a vague motivation and an "arbitrary doomsday machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This robs the themes of control and oppression of any meaning, as "all nuance is thrown out the window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The film neither develops the idea that oppressive power is necessary nor suggests it is evil; instead, the corrupt status quo is reinstated, and those under control "almost unilaterally get the shaft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Harley Quinn and The Joker's Unresolved Arcs

One of the biggest criticisms is that Jared Leto's Joker serves "no purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. His line, "desire becomes surrender, surrender becomes power," hints at a deeper thematic discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This concept is briefly manifested at the end when the Enchantress tries to seduce the Squad with their desires, making them want to surrender and granting her power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

There are hints that the writer attempted to establish an arc for Harley Quinn related to desire, surrender, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Initially, she submits to desire by letting the Joker dominate her, and later she rejects the Enchantress's domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. However, this does not result in a "paradigm shifting moment" for Harley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. She ends up "right back under the thumb of the Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Consequently, the film fails to develop the theme of control in any meaningful way through her character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The film's ultimate message regarding control or freedom is ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. It becomes "a movie about subjugated people defending their own imprisonment against someone who's also been a victim of control," but "not in a cool way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. It is described as "just a mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Conclusion

While there is "a spark of intelligence in *Suicide Squad*" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, suggesting earlier, potentially better versions of the film were abandoned by the studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, the final product largely misses its opportunities for meaningful [[thematic_analysis_of_suicide_squad | thematic analysis]] and [[critique_of_character_agency_in_the_film | character development]].

*Rick and Morty* is a show that explores philosophy and science, often hiding these deeper themes beneath its comedic surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The series follows a mad scientist and his naive grandson on "deeply irresponsible and awesome space adventures," often paralleling the plot of *Back to the Future*, but with different character dynamics and a focus on alternate dimensions rather than time travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Roots in Sci-Fi and Horror Traditions

The show is deeply rooted in the traditions of [[rick_and_morty_references_to_scifi_and_horror | sci-fi horror]], frequently paying homage to works like *Ghostbusters*, filmmaker David Cronenberg, *Nosferatu*, and Freddy Kreuger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It even references *Zardoz* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

While *Rick and Morty* pays homage to a wide spectrum of sci-fi and horror, it has a particular affinity for cosmic horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This genre, pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft, emphasizes the terror of that which is beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Similar to Lovecraft, the show uses the cosmos to explore deep philosophical questions by imagining what lurks in the "black depths of space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show's opening visually references Lovecraft’s Cthulhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Cosmic horror, as depicted in the show, goes beyond mere jump-scares; it presents the vast, unimaginable unknown and the feeling of fright, disgust, and dread when incomprehensible entities invade human reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick's portal gun constantly confronts viewers with this unknown, leading to results that are sometimes horrifying, sometimes hilarious, and sometimes both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

An example of this is the "Get Schwifty" episode, where Earth is approached by a giant space-head (a Cromulon) that causes planetary mayhem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This cosmic entity commands Earth to "show them what they've got," leading to a cult worshiping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick reveals that Earth must win an intergalactic "America's Got Talent" to avoid disintegration by a giant space laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Such giant floating cosmic entities are a recurring theme in science fiction, notably used by Lovecraft with his "Great Old Ones" in works like *The Call of Cthulhu* and *The Dunwich Horror* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Cosmic Pessimism and Human Insignificance

[[Philosophy and Cosmic Horror in Rick and Morty | Cosmic horror]] in *Rick and Morty* frequently poses the question: Are humans significant? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> While most science fiction places humanity at the center of the universe, cosmic horror inverts this premise, asking: What if the universe is indifferent to us? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> For the Cromulons, humanity is merely a source of entertainment, and annihilating a planet is not an act of malice but simply something they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept highlights humanity's insignificance, which is presented as both terrifying and darkly hilarious in the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

American philosopher Eugene Thacker describes this "Cosmic Pessimism," prevalent in horror, as imagining a "world-without-us" where the universe is "absolutely unhuman, and indifferent to the hopes, desires and struggles of human individuals and groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty* embodies this pessimism, even showing Rick and Morty dying and being replaced by infinite alternate versions of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show suggests that not only is humanity a "speck of dust" in the cosmos, but also one of "an infinite amount of the exact same speck of dust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead of terrifying viewers with this insignificance, the show encourages them to laugh at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Furthermore, the show demonstrates that humans, too, can be "cosmic horrors" to other beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy," Rick's car battery is powered by a micro-universe whose sole purpose is to produce energy, and within that universe, another mini-universe is invented, creating an endless chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rick effectively acts as a Lovecraftian cosmic deity to the inhabitants of these micro-verses, creating a "cosmic inception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In a multiverse of infinite possibilities, values and meanings slip away, leaving only pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Science and Rationalism

[[Rick and Morty and Existentialism | Rick and Morty]] addresses the question of existence in almost every episode, contrasting the cosmic insignificance of humanity with the frivolity of individual human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show uses science to underscore these bleak realities.

Science in *Rick and Morty* allows for a sense of understanding through formulas and theorems, but simultaneously forces humans to confront the "bleak, arbitrary nature of our own existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It can "reason away any sense of sanctity or emotion" and turn the human experience into something meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For example, Rick mathematically explains to Summer and Morty that they are "pieces of shit" and rationalizes his bond with Morty as merely a way to hide his genius brain waves from intergalactic authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The show constantly plays with the dichotomy between meaningless simulations and actual life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In one episode, Morty grows up and dies in a video game called "Roy," briefly forgetting his own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prompts the audience to question what separates the "fake" reality of the game from actual existence, especially if the simulated life experiences all emotions and sensations of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. *Rick and Morty* quickly suggests that the idea of "authenticity" in waking life is "a giant crock of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, asking what distinguishes killing memory parasites (for whom the family feels genuine emotion) from shooting a character like Mr. Poopybutthole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Satire of Science and Sci-Fi Tropes

The fictional and sometimes almost-real science in *Rick and Morty* allows for the exploration of depressing questions, while also serving as an excuse for "nerdy jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Some jokes are obvious, like an entire episode loosely based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show draws humor from a superficial reading of this principle, claiming that quantum uncertainty can cause realities to split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It also references Schrödinger's cat, a thought experiment about a cat being both alive and dead in a quantum state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This "tenuous relationship to scientific truth" can be viewed as a jab at the [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | science fiction genre]] for constantly inventing "scientific mumbo-jumbo to justify unlikely plot points," such as "stupid and smart brain-waves canceling each other out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In another episode, Rick is seen traversing tiny climates on a tiny planet, which is "not at all how that works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show also pokes fun at the trust placed in TV narratives through jokes about forced perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Science vs. Religion/Mysticism

The show also exhibits a unique kind of [[rick_and_mortys_view_on_religion_and_atheism | atheism]] by constantly invalidating religious figures, boiling them down to "pure science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It acknowledges the frequent misuse of science by those with religious agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In "Something Ricked This Way Comes," Jerry's "personal" interpretation of science leads him on a crusade to reinstate Pluto’s planet-hood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Plutonians, with their "not-so-subtle crosses in their eyes," are presented as a comparison to religious fundamentalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is ultimately revealed to be a ploy to manipulate them into accepting the destruction of their planet by corporate overlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

By exploring the absurdities of a purely rational universe and pushing the boundaries of decency within a [[rick_and_morty_references_to_scifi_and_horror | sci-fi horror]] setting, *Rick and Morty* allows for the exploration of "fun, depressing questions" such as "Why am I here?" and "What’s the point of it all?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The show holds nothing as sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

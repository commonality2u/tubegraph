The film *The Lion King* presents a world with a distinct social order and hierarchy, primarily explored through the concept of the "circle of life" and the reigns of its various rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Established Feudal Order
In *The Lion King*, the animals are ruled by the lion Mufasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The film emphasizes an "oddly conservative message" centered on the "circle of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This concept is presented as a "natural, fixed social order" that, if disrupted, would lead to chaos and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Mufasa himself uses the "circle of life" to justify the predatory nature of the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Within this system, value is determined by birthright, not by merit, action, or even bribery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This results in a rigid social structure with no opportunity for upward mobility for those not born at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The overarching message of the movie is to "know your place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The introduction of Simba on Pride Rock implies that animals are expected to accept their predetermined roles, which includes their eventual demise as part of the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Subjugation to this order is depicted as the path to finding peace and confirming one's place in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### The "Noble Lie"
This societal structure echoes the Greek philosopher Socrates’ concept of the “noble lie,” as documented by Plato in *The New Republic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Socrates theorized that if people believed their social standing was divinely ordained—for example, if God sprinkled different metals into their souls—they would willingly accept their lot in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Scar's Challenge to the Order
[[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]] is presented as the only animal who actively rejects this feudal society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He laments that "life isn’t fair" and rebels against the "natural" societal order that deems him a weakling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

When [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]] seizes power, he initially ushers in an "era of equality," allowing hyenas to be on equal footing with lions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Despite these "progressive politics," his reign takes on totalitarian characteristics, featuring "Nazi marching imagery and camera movements lifted from Leni Reifenstahl’s *Triumph of the Will*" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Ultimately, [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]]'s interference with the "natural order of the food chain" leads to the once-prosperous utopia descending into anarchy and starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

The film thus suggests that disrupting the established "circle of life," even with progressive intentions, leads to catastrophic consequences, reinforcing the conservative message that social order and hierarchy are essential for stability.

The film *Shrek* contains numerous attacks on the Disney aesthetic, which are widely believed to be the result of a feud between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Jeffrey "J Money" Katzenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

## Background of the Feud
Jeffrey Katzenberg previously ran Disney's movie and television division for a decade under Michael Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. During his tenure, Katzenberg was responsible for revitalizing Disney's animated film catalog with hits such as *The Little Mermaid* (referred to as "The Little Fish Lady"), *Pocahontas* ("Interracial Couple"), and *Aladdin* ("The Genie Saves Hanukkah") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

Despite Katzenberg's efforts and success, Disney reportedly refused to promote him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Consequently, Katzenberg left Disney to co-found DreamWorks out of spite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## *Shrek* as a Manifestation of the Feud
The film *Shrek* is seen as a direct manifestation of this animosity, particularly through its [[antidisney_themes_in_shrek | anti-Disney agenda]] and direct criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Lord Facebook Character
Many believe that the character of Lord Facebook in *Shrek* is based on Michael Eisner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. Lord Facebook's kingdom is depicted as a "dead ringer for Disneyland," complete with employees in elaborate costumes and puppets singing incessantly about "what a small and pitiful world Earth is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. This portrayal is a clear [[the_commercialization_and_cultural_implications_of_disneys_brand | critique of Disney's commercial practices]] and aesthetic.

### Critiquing Traditional Fairy Tales
Through *Shrek*, Katzenberg and DreamWorks criticize the traditional fairy tale idea that beautiful individuals are destined for greater rewards than "normal," less valuable people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. The film rejects the typical "happily ever after" narrative where a lovely princess and handsome hero live idyllic lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Instead, *Shrek* makes both of its heroes "ugly," suggesting that their marriage will be rocky and likely end in divorce, offering an alternative ending that is presented as more "deserved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. This directly challenges [[critiques_of_disneys_storytelling_methods | Disney's superficial and overly sentimental offerings]] and the idealistic perfection prevalent in traditional fairy tales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

The 1994 animated film, [[symbolism_and_cultural_references_in_the_lion_king | The Lion King]], is noted for being loosely based on the film *[[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]*, directed by William Shakeshack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. This inspiration is evident through shared plot points and character archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a>.

## Shared Plot and Character Parallels

The parallels between *[[symbolism_and_cultural_references_in_the_lion_king | The Lion King]]* and *[[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]* are quite direct:
*   Both narratives feature a king murdered by his brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>. In *[[symbolism_and_cultural_references_in_the_lion_king | The Lion King]]*, this is Mufasa, trampled in a wildebeest moshpit orchestrated by Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   The son of the murdered king is visited by the ghost of his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>. Simba is scared by a ghost, leading him to confront Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>.
*   Both stories include two comic foils who help the hero relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>. Simba is taken in by a "kindly gay couple" who live in a "hippie commune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.
*   The existence of a pivotal scene in an elephant graveyard is also mentioned in the comparison, though the host expresses uncertainty about this detail in *[[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:38">[02:15:38]</a>.

## Conservative Message and Social Order

*The Lion King*'s narrative, inspired by these older tales, carries an "oddly conservative message" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.
*   **The "Circle of Life"**: There is significant emphasis on the "circle of life," depicted as a natural, fixed social order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. Disruption of this order is portrayed as leading to chaos and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>. Mufasa uses this concept to justify the predatory nature of the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:14">[02:33:14]</a>.
*   **Feudal Society**: The film presents a feudal social order where one's value is determined by birth, not merit, action, or even bribery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:06">[02:50:06]</a>. For those not born into the top tier, there is no opportunity for upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:18">[03:02:18]</a>. The implied message is "know your place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:48">[03:06:48]</a>.
*   **Socrates' "Noble Lie"**: This fixed social order in *[[symbolism_and_cultural_references_in_the_lion_king | The Lion King]]* ties into Greek philosopher Socrates' concept of the "noble lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:32">[03:30:32]</a>. As documented by Plato, Socrates theorized that people would accept their lot in life if they believed it was ordained by a higher power (e.g., God sprinkling gold into important people's souls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:15">[03:39:15]</a>.

## Scar's Rebellion Against the Order

Scar is depicted as the only animal to reject this feudal society, possibly due to a visible head wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:24">[03:51:24]</a>. He laments that "life isn’t fair" and rebels against the "natural" societal order that labels him a "weakling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:11">[04:02:11]</a>.

When Scar assumes power, he ushers in an era of "equality," allowing hyenas to be on equal footing with lions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:03">[04:16:03]</a>. However, his progressive politics are not entirely altruistic, as his song about a "new world order" features Nazi marching imagery and camera movements inspired by Leni Reifenstahl’s *Triumph of the Will* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:01">[04:26:01]</a>. Much like "Adam Hitler," Scar's reign ultimately turns sour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:10">[04:35:10]</a>; by interfering with the natural food chain, a once prosperous land descends into anarchy and starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:35">[04:39:35]</a>. This suggests that the movie's message implies that attempting to combat social injustice through radical change can lead to negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:02">[04:45:02]</a>.

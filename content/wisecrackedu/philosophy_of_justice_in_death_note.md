*Death Note*, the popular anime phenomenon, delves deeply into the concept of justice, exploring what it is and how it should be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Unlike most pop culture that presents a clear-cut idea of justice, *Death Note* is unique in *how* it approaches the subject, constantly challenging various definitions rather than stating one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The show doesn't provide a clear stance on what constitutes justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, but rather employs a unique method to explore it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Light Yagami's Conception of Justice

The narrative follows Light Yagami, a model student who discovers the Death Note—a notebook capable of killing anyone whose name is written in it while picturing their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Light's initial aim is to use the Death Note to create a world devoid of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, eventually adopting the public persona of "Kira," the God of this new world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Light's sense of moral obligation is evident early on:
> "This world is rotting and those who are making it rot deserve to die." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
> "Someone has to do it so why not me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>

As Kira, Light embodies an "ends-justify-the-means" philosophy, believing that being a "crime-zapping uber-tyrant" justifies almost any action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This includes shamelessly using his girlfriend to distract the police and maximize his kill count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, and even killing non-criminals who obstruct his goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

When Light temporarily renounces ownership of the Death Note, he loses his memories of being Kira, and his personality and sense of justice noticeably change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He transitions from a "by any means necessary" attitude to a more considerate one, refusing to exploit Misa's feelings for information, a stark contrast to his past behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:
> "To me, exploiting another person's feelings for personal gain is unforgivable and I won't allow myself to stoop that low." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>

However, upon touching the Death Note again and regaining his memories and powers, his Kira persona immediately returns, along with his willingness to manipulate others for "Justice with a capital J" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This tension between Light pre- and post-notebook ownership is a recurring theme, often portrayed through Light's internal conversations grappling with moral and practical dilemmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Kira's [[different_theories_of_justice_presented_in_death_note | conception of justice]] is an Old Testament-style bloodbath, where sinners are punished, and blasphemy is the ultimate sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. He views himself as a martyr, willing to sacrifice his mind and soul to create a "perfect world" free of criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This quasi-utilitarian view suggests that by becoming a god and eliminating criminals, he will ensure peace and happiness for the greatest number of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Light acknowledges that this process will lead to him contending with a "rotten self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Anonymity and the Ring of Gyges

A key philosophical question explored in *Death Note* is: "What does Justice mean when nobody's looking?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This theme resonates with the ancient Greek story, "The Ring of Gyges" from Plato's *Republic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The story tells of a man who finds a ring that grants him invisibility, which he immediately uses to commit unjust acts—seducing the queen, killing the king, and taking over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

In *The Republic*, Glaucon, Plato's brother, uses this fable to argue that [[role_of_anonymity_in_shaping_justice_in_death_note | justice is merely a social contract]] to prevent mutual harm, and that people value justice only for its ability to make them look good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The thought experiment suggests that with anonymity, people would naturally act without moral constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This is directly mirrored in *Death Note* through Light's pseudonymity as Kira, L and N's namelessness, and the anonymity of Kira's online supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Light, the "golden boy valedictorian," maintains a public facade of morality while secretly taking joy in actions far worse than "breaking the royal bro code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. His transformation aligns with Glaucon's assertion that the power of invisibility inevitably leads one to act unjustly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## *Death Note* as a Socratic Dialogue

The show functions as a modern Socratic Dialogue, similar to Plato's *Republic*, which is less concerned with offering a definitive theory of justice and more with detailing the process of exploring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. *Death Note* portrays the movement and evolution of [[different_theories_of_justice_presented_in_death_note | theories of justice]] both between and within its characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Many characters, including Light, Misa, and Mikami, believe they possess the true knowledge of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The tension between these characters and their skeptics drives the show's philosophical core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The iconic declaration, "I am justice," is voiced by both Light and L, highlighting their opposing claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Light, by reducing violent crime and ending wars, claims to *become* justice itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The philosophical inquiry begins early, with Ryuk challenging Light's plan to eliminate criminals:
> "But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
This observation highlights a central contradiction in Light's argument and initiates the Socratic Dialogue that spans the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Competing Ideals: Ideal Theory vs. Injustice Theory

The show presents two primary approaches to justice:

1.  **Ideal Theory (Light/Kira)**: Similar to philosopher John Rawls, Light believes that to correct societal injustices, one must first have an idea of what "justice" truly is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This approach considers what justice would look like in a perfect world where everyone did the right thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. For Light and Mikami, this "ideal" involves the death of many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
2.  **Injustice Theory (L, M, N)**: Philosopher Naomi Zack's "injustice theory" does not rely on a predefined ideal of justice but focuses on identifying injustices as they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. It's more practical to point out an injustice than to start from a broad definition of what is just <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Only after an injustice is identified can justice be applied to correct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

L, speaking as Lind L. Tailor, highlights the contradiction in Kira's reasoning: if a just world is without criminality, then the act of killing people is itself an injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. L's pursuit of Kira is driven not by a high-minded definition of justice, but by the recognition that Kira's "new world" is unjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. His concept of justice appears to be a response to injustice, making the definition of "The Just" secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This struggle between these differing beliefs characterizes much of the show's philosophical method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Other Characters as Inquisitors

While Light and L represent the primary opposing forces, other characters also act as inquisitors:

*   **L**: Beyond his opposition to Kira, L often plays the role of an inquisitor, much like Socrates in *The Republic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. His ambiguous code of justice and focus on winning a game of wits allows him to continually probe Light's justifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Matsuda**: A more surprising inquisitor is Matsuda, who raises sincere questions about the moral judgments of nearly everyone, including Light, Kira, the Japanese Police, and L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Despite being mocked for his inability to conform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, Matsuda questions the core belief in Kira's inherent evilness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>:
    > "Do you guys ever think that maybe Kira isn't completely evil?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>
    > "I don't really know, but I think that Kira's trying to fight evil and change the world in his own way and well the worlds become a good place for people who live honest lives so..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>
    Matsuda serves as both an audience surrogate and a philosophical foil, constantly questioning the values presented as fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Like Socrates, he recognizes his own ignorance, which helps reveal the ignorance of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Even in his final act against Light, he does so with questions, not answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

## Ambiguity and Conclusion

After ten years of fan forums, there remains no consensus on who best represented justice in *Death Note*, or whether Light's "New World" justified his means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. This ambiguity is what makes the show so poignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. While it's an addicting detective procedural, *Death Note* never abandons its central question of what makes a just world, and crucially, it never provides a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

As Light himself summarizes:
> "If Kira gets caught then that makes him evil. But if he wins and rules the world then I guess he's justice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>

The show concludes with Kira's defeat and N's brand of justice prevailing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, yet it leaves the viewer with the unsettling idea that the outcome of this "war of competing moral codes" was merely a "logic game," not a revelation of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. This suggests that "justice" could be seen as meaningless in this context, where the victor dictates the moral truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

The true connection between [[comparative_analysis_of_death_note_and_greek_philosophy | the philosophy of justice in *The Republic* and *Death Note*]] lies not in their definitions, but in their methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. This methodological similarity distinguishes *Death Note* as a show that actively "does philosophy" rather than merely borrowing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>, leaving viewers to grapple with the [[moral_dilemmas_and_character_evolution_in_death_note | complex moral dilemmas]] presented.

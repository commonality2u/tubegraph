## The Ghost of the Old King

The supernatural plays a significant role in the events of [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]. The "shit's gone wack" in the kingdom of Elsinore, particularly after some guards witness the ghost of the old King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These guards then inform [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]], urging him to confront the apparition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

When [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] speaks with his "ghost daddy," he learns that his uncle, [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius | Claudius]], murdered the old King to usurp the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The ghost demands that [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] seek "street justice" and kill [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius | Claudius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

To confirm the ghost's claims, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] stages a play that reenacts the King's murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. When [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius | Claudius]] reacts by fleeing the scene, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] becomes certain that the ghost was "spittin the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Ambiguity of the Ghost

Despite the apparent confirmation, the play introduces uncertainties regarding the ghost's nature:
*   "Can we really trust [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]]â€™s ghost daddy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   "Can errybody see the ghost in Act 1 but only my boy [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] in Act 3?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>

## Hamlet's Madness

After the ghost's revelation, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] begins acting "cray-cray" at the prospect of killing [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius | Claudius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This behavior leads others to believe he is merely "love-sick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Interpretations of Hamlet's State of Mind

One of the central uncertainties in the play revolves around whether [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is genuinely insane or merely feigning madness: "Is [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] just pretending to be crazy? Or has his mad fiction become fact?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

[[hamlets_procrastination_and_internal_conflict | Hamlet's procrastination]] regarding his task of avenging his father is one of the most debated subjects in [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Shakespeare]]'s works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Various interpretations attempt to explain his delay and his mental state:
*   Some suggest [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is "too much of a sensitive bitch to kick it in a world of gangstas playin dirty on tha street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Others propose that [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] has an "Oedipal Complex," implying he cannot kill [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius | Claudius]] because [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius | Claudius]] has done what [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] subconsciously desires: killed his father and engaged with his mother, [[character_analysis_of_hamlet_and_claudius | Gertrude]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   A third perspective suggests [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is trying to challenge a "crooked kingdom overflowin with lies and [[themes_of_corruption_and_treachery_in_hamlet | treachery]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Ultimately, like the modern man, [[summary_of_hamlet_by_shakespeare | Hamlet]] is depicted as having "a divided mind and will," lacking a clear devotion to a code and grappling with "ethical and metaphysical uncertainties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. His famous "to be or not to be" speech highlights this [[hamlets_procrastination_and_internal_conflict | internal conflict]], with some believing it questions whether to live or die, and others interpreting it as a choice between Christian self-denial and seeking vengeance to reclaim his throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

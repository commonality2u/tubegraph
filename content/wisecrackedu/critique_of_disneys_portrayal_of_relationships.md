*Frozen*, an Academy Award-winning film, presents a nuanced, albeit at times conservative, perspective on relationships, particularly challenging some traditional Disney tropes while reinforcing others regarding social connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Subverting Traditional Romance

The film explicitly critiques the concept of "love at first sight," a staple in many fairy tales and early Disney narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:40">[04:31:40]</a>. Anna meets Prince Hans and they quickly decide to marry after just two conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. Elsa vocalizes the film's skepticism, stating, "You can't marry a man you just met" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. This skepticism is validated when Hans is revealed to be a villain, interested only in the throne, thereby "extinguishing the passion Anna had for him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.

In contrast, the relationship between Anna and Kristoff is portrayed as developing slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:39">[04:38:39]</a>. While Anna initially attempts to secure a kiss from Kristoff as an "act of true love" to thaw her frozen heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:16">[02:22:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, the film ultimately avoids a definitive wedding for them, opting for a more gradual courtship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:39">[04:38:39]</a>.

## The Power of Sisterly Love

A significant departure from typical Disney narratives is the film's emphasis on sisterly love as the ultimate "act of true love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:38">[04:22:38]</a>. Anna's frozen heart can only be thawed by such an act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:45">[01:48:45]</a>. Instead of a prince, it is Anna's self-sacrificing act for Elsa that resolves the crisis, demonstrating that "heroes’ redemption arrives in the form of sisterly love, rather than that of a charming prince or frog or whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:08">[02:29:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:38">[04:22:38]</a>. This act of love allows Elsa to "realize the power of love," enabling her to reverse the eternal winter she inadvertently caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a>.

## [[Societal and cultural messages in Frozen | Critique of Independence and Social Solidarity]]

Despite its progressive portrayal of sisterly love, *Frozen* is criticized for its message that independence is a "mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>. The film suggests that all people "require connection," presenting a solitary person as "incomplete and in need of fixing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:15">[04:04:15]</a>. This aligns with what is termed "Disney’s mob mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>. Elsa, initially isolated due to her powers and fear of her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:26">[03:26:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>, only finds "real fulfillment" and happiness through "social solidarity" and embracing the love of her sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:20">[03:47:20]</a>. As the medical staff states, "We need each other to fix us up and round us out!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

## Symbolism of Doors and Openness

A recurring motif in the film is the "door," symbolizing both isolation and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:18">[04:49:18]</a>. The film begins with the kingdom's gates closed and the door separating Elsa and Anna throughout their childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:33">[04:54:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:39">[04:58:39]</a>. Elsa's iconic song features the line, "Turn away and slam the door!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:08">[05:07:08]</a>, representing her desire for solitude. However, Anna later pleads, "Please don't slam the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:06">[05:13:06]</a>. The film concludes with the kingdom's gates open, with Anna stating, "We’re never closing them again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:37">[05:15:37]</a>. This overtly symbolizes Elsa's decision to no longer shut her sister out, highlighting the importance of openness in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:44">[05:23:44]</a>.

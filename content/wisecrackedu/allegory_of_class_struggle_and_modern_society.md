Season 3, Episode 7 of *Rick and Morty*, "The Ricklantis Mixup," is presented as one of the darkest and densest episodes, building a complex political world only for the show to dismiss it summarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The episode, despite its short runtime, offers an interesting picture of modern politics, specifically concerning hope, resistance, and revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Mirroring Modern Politics

The world-building in "The Ricklantis Mixup" cleverly mirrors the current political climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Examples include:
*   A news organization (one "N" away from CNN) that trivializes dissent to maintain the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   An inner city devastated by drugs and guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   A Hogwarts-like institution that teaches disenfranchised Mortys to accept their place in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## The Crushing of Optimism

The episode features multiple subplots that collectively demonstrate how any political or personal optimism for change is crushed by a cruel and indifferent reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>:
*   **Evil Morty's Rise** Evil Morty comes to power on a platform of unity and change, but quickly reveals totalitarian intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Police Rick's Corruption** A fresh-out-of-the-academy police Rick joins a crooked cop Morty and confronts the corrupt underbelly of the Citadel, forcing him to abandon his ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This arc is reminiscent of the ending of "L.A. Confidential," where an idealistic cop undermines the justice system he thought he was protecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Orphan Mortys' Dashed Dreams** A group of orphaned Mortys embark on an adventure, hoping to escape their terrible existence, but their "wish portal" turns out to be a literal garbage portal, symbolizing how the system turns wishes into trash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Slick Morty's sacrifice for a better world appears to have no actual bearing on the overall narrative, serving only to show the naivety of the children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Assembly Line Rick's Failed Rebellion** A Rick, passed over for promotion, realizes he's wasted his life on an assembly line. He revolts, but his triumph is quickly ruined by the powers that be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Class Struggle and Alienation

The episode builds on [[themes_allegory_of_society_and_human_nature | themes]] of alienation, illustrating how modern society estranges individuals from the world and their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Many versions of Rick, the smartest man in the universe, are reduced to the drudgery of modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

A deeply divided society is depicted, with soaring numbers of displaced Mortys and plummeting Rick satisfaction levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. However, Evil Morty suggests this Ricks vs. Mortys divide is a distraction, and the real division is between the rich and the working class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Despite the apparent ruling class of Ricks, everyone is a victim of alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Even Ricks are stripped of their uniqueness and reduced to roles like plumbers, or cops who are likened to workers on an assembly line of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Beyond individual oppressors, Ricks are also victims of an impenetrable system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This highlights [[the_politics_of_disposability_and_class_struggle | the politics of disposability and class struggle]].

### The Commodification of Escape

The episode introduces Simple Rick, whose happiest memory of his daughter is exploited to produce "Simple Rick Simple Wafers," a commodity that offers the "impossible flavor of your own completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This raises the question: does the escape from the alienation of modern life merely strengthen the foundations of the system causing that alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>?

The "Ron Swanson" trope, of fighting the fast-paced world by slowing down, working with hands, and spending time with family, is explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This idea of the "simple life" gained prevalence during industrialization and was subsequently corporatized through phenomena like the Boy Scouts and national parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

However, this escape to the simple life (nature, family, trade) can be seen not as retreating from the system, but as an essential part of its functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The Simple Rick wafers brand is a fantasy that reinforces the system: Ricks work because they believe they can unplug with the distilled essence of simplicity, even though this "unplugging" is a commodity requiring money earned at an assembly line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This exemplifies [[corporate_influence_and_spectacle_in_modern_society | corporate influence and spectacle in modern society]].

Sociologist George Ritzer's ideas suggest that enchantment with and disenchantment from the modern world are not easily distinguished and exist in a reciprocal relation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The fantasy of unplugging with Simple Rick Wafers further entrenches individuals in the very system they wish to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### The Commodification of Rebellion and [[the_concept_of_powerlessness_in_modern_society | The Illusion of Difference]]

The episode's darkest point occurs when a Rick's act of rebellion—killing his boss to escape the system—is commodified into "Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. He endlessly lives the joy of rebellion, while the system distills this joy into a consumable form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Freedom from the system paradoxically entraps one within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Ritzer posits that fantasies draw people into new means of consumption, and these fantasies can be rationalized to further embed people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

The overarching message conveyed is that in the terrifying political reality, the best one can hope for is the illusion of making a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Evil Morty sold a form of [[the_politics_of_disposability_and_class_struggle | class consciousness]] to unite Ricks and Mortys against the ruling elite, but his brutal purge of political opponents suggests this was mere lip service to gain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

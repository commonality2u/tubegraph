*Goblin Slayer* is an anime that quickly gained notoriety for its intense opening scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Beyond its shock value, the series offers an intriguing development for the fantasy genre, centering on the question: "Why does Goblin Slayer only kill goblins, and how does that form the show's greater message?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

## Embracing and Subverting Generic Fantasy

The series heavily references traditional fantasy elements, such as those found in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), including dice rolling, spell slots, guilds, and quests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It even leans into the generic naming conventions of the genre, with characters and places often referred to by labels like "Elven Ranger," "Watertown," or "Sword Maiden," and antagonists named "Goblin Champion" or "Demon Lord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

In typical fantasy narratives, heroes begin by confronting minor threats like "rats, bugs, [or] goblins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, gradually escalating to face a "horrifying villain" that threatens the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The story progresses linearly, building from small problems to a climactic confrontation with a "big one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, after which things are expected to return to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

*Goblin Slayer* explicitly [[analysis_of_goblin_slayers_focus_on_goblin_killing | subverts this traditional fantasy progression]] by having its protagonist declare, "I'd rather just kill goblins, thanks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Even with a looming Demon Lord threat, Goblin Slayer prioritizes goblins, arguing that "even if the Demon Lord dies, goblins will still terrorize rural and vulnerable areas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This focus on "the little guys" challenges the fantasy genre's basic assumption of a "happily ever after" once the main antagonist is defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The series dramatically underscores this point by having the Demon Lord dispatched in under a minute by "some random heroes that we neither know nor care about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Peace Theory and Persistent Problems

The show's logic can be understood through [[understanding_peace_theory_in_the_context_of_goblin_slayer | peace theory]], which distinguishes between two types of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>:

*   **Negative Peace**: The absence of large-scale conflict or war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. In fantasy terms, this means a world without a "Night King, or Sauron, or Ganondorf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Positive Peace**: The presence of justice and protections that serve the needs of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This is what Goblin Slayer pursues. While it manifests as fighting goblins in the show, in the real world, it represents pervasive issues like "poverty, famine, disease, corruption, discrimination, [or] crime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>—the "goblins of the real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

For many, violence is an interruption, but for the vulnerable, it is the constant backdrop of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Goblin Slayer understands that the world's structure guarantees that "people out on farms will always face goblin attacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. His tireless effort to eliminate goblin nests, though not conventionally peaceful, is a form of "conflict prevention and development," initiating long-term protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## [[critique_of_heroism_and_societal_roles_in_goblin_slayer | The Grunt Work of Heroism]]

The series highlights how "smaller issues can compound to create an equally crappy reality for many" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The "small work" of dealing with goblins is often "balked at" because "everyone wants the glory of killing the Demon Lord, but chopping goblins—that's child's play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Despite being a Silver-ranked adventurer, Goblin Slayer faces mockery for his choice of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The show uses the metaphor of "toilets going uncleaned because nobody wants to be the janitor" to illustrate the neglected essential work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This reflects real-world scenarios where people gravitate towards high-prestige, high-paying jobs, even if they lack the highest social impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, such as doctors researching cancer getting more attention than those preventing stomach illnesses through routine water testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Goblin Slayer, who once aspired to kill dragons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, only committed to his specific mission after directly experiencing the dangers of goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Consequences of Underestimating Small Threats

The stigma surrounding goblin slaying leads to two major issues:

1.  **Minimization of Threat**: Many minimize the threat goblins pose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. While slaying goblins might seem simple (swinging swords, cutting heads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, they are dangerous and have their own "tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Because goblins are perceived as a "simple problem," unqualified adventurers are sent to deal with them, often resulting in their deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Problem**: Goblins breed and become more dangerous over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Major heroes avoid getting involved, either viewing goblins as mere pests or being too embarrassed to admit the threat they pose after having defeated greater evils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The Sword Maiden, a powerful figure who once slayed the original Demon Lord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, covertly hired Goblin Slayer to deal with goblins under her city after her own traumatic encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Admitting fear of goblins after defeating a Demon Lord goes "against the unspoken hero code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Goblin attacks leave people in a constant state of "fear and anxiety," contributing to an already difficult life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Goblin Slayer's intervention, both in killing the goblins and speaking with the Sword Maiden about her fears, significantly impacts her well-being, freeing her from goblin nightmares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This highlights the importance of positive peace in improving psychological conditions, even if material conditions remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Narrative Implications

This [[impact_of_small_threats_in_fantasy_narratives | subversion of traditional fantasy narrative progression]] poses a unique challenge for the show's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Normally, threats escalate throughout a series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. However, since the Demon Lord has already been dispatched and Goblin Slayer is committed to only slaying goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, the narrative must find creative ways to "up the stakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This may involve more ambiguity regarding the goblin threat or the problem hitting Goblin Slayer closer to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

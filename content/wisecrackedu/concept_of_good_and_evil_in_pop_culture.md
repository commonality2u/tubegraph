*Rick and Morty*'s episode "The Vindicators 3: Return of the World Ender" offers a critique of the traditional portrayal of good and evil in superhero narratives, particularly those found in Marvel movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The episode acts as a commentary on the formulaic state of popular cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> and delves into the nuanced nature of morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, subverting the simplistic understanding of heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Subverting Heroism and Worldviews

The narrative of "The Vindicators 3" centers on Morty's optimistic worldview crumbling as the superhero genre is subverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Rick, after drunkenly destroying the ominous Worldender, traps the Vindicators in a series of "Saw"-inspired trials designed to push them over a moral cliff and reveal their true colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This scheme ultimately ruins the Vindicators, confirming Rick's cynical view of heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

## Villains as Moral Catalysts

The episode draws inspiration from villains in popular cinema who aim to change paradigms rather than simply commit senseless acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Jigsaw's Influence

Jigsaw, from the "Saw" franchise, seeks to change people's paradigms by making them endure suffering, often to make them appreciate life more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Similarly, Drunk Rick's trials are not primarily meant to eradicate the Vindicators, but to create a moral crisis for them, proving to Morty that they are not heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### The Joker's Nihilistic Philosophy

A less obvious, but significant, inspiration is The Joker, particularly from Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. The Joker's motivation goes beyond murder; he aims to prove that "all it takes is a little push" for anyone to descend into madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Rick's actions mirror this by pushing the Vindicators to lose their moral composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Just as The Joker infects Harvey Dent with his nihilistic philosophy in [[The Concept of Justice and Morality in The Dark Knight | *The Dark Knight*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, Rick turns the benevolent Vindicators into violent backstabbers, thereby "upending Mortyâ€™s simplistic understanding of good and evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

> "Oh, I don't know, you managed to destroy just about everything today, the villains, the heroes, the lines between them... my childhood." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>

## Critiquing Simplistic Morality and "Infinite Justice"

The episode suggests that narratives which spoon-feed simplistic ideas of good and evil are problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Philosopher Jacques Ranciere's concept of "Evil" (with a capital E) is used to illustrate how such thinking can escalate any conflict into an ultimate struggle for the "soul of the world," justifying extreme actions for victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This concept of "infinite evil" warrants "infinite justice," which often disregards morals or human life, as exemplified by the Vindicators' extermination of an entire planet to kill a shapeshifting villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

## The "Noble Lie" and its Implications

By the end of the episode, Supernova, like Rick, no longer believes in a real division between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. However, she recognizes that the simplistic division must be upheld for the galaxy's faith and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. She is willing to kill to protect the *perception* that the Vindicators are good, highlighting that their actions are less important than the galaxy's faith in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

This concept is a direct shoutout to [[The Concept of Justice and Morality in The Dark Knight | *The Dark Knight*]], which is presented as a prime example of [[Moral ambiguity in cinema | moral greyness]] in comic book movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. In *The Dark Knight*, Batman lies about Harvey Dent's "goodness" to maintain peace in Gotham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Both instances advocate for a "noble lie," an idea made famous by Plato, where societies are built on a myth to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. While *The Dark Knight* celebrates this lie, *Rick and Morty* uses it to deconstruct the myth of superheroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Nihilism and Dogma

While *Rick and Morty* deconstructs good and evil as arbitrary concepts, it also suggests that the complete absence of these concepts is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Rick's belief that "nothing matters" and that good and evil are "artificial constructs" serves as a justification for his actions, allowing him to do "whatever the f*** he wants" without considering them evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

The episode ultimately presents two equally dismal perspectives on good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>:
*   **Zero conviction**: Leads to nihilism and uncontrolled actions (Rick's approach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Complete conviction**: Leads to people doing "really messed up shit for the sake of good," like blowing up an entire planet (the Vindicators' approach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

As is characteristic of *Rick and Morty*, the show offers no right answers, "only wrong ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

*Rick and Morty* Season 3, particularly its finale "The Rickchurian Mortydate," continues to emphasize the meaninglessness of existence, posing a challenge for character growth in a show where "Nothing you think matters matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The show offers a solution "a little better than just spiraling deeper into nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, primarily through the matriarch of the Smith family, Beth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Amor Fati: Love of Fate

"Amor Fati" is a Latin phrase used by Friedrich Nietzsche, meaning "Love of Fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It signifies the affirmation of life, being a "Yes-Sayer" to existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This concept is proposed as a "cure for common nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Eternal Recurrence

Amor Fati is tied to Nietzsche's thought experiment known as "Eternal Recurrence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This concept challenges an individual to consider if they would want to infinitely relive their entire life, including "the good, the bad, and everything in between" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. To desire to relive every moment for eternity is presented as the "ultimate affirmation of life" and the essence of Amor Fati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This thought experiment is part of Nietzsche's "grand plan to escape the crushing nihilism of existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Beth's Embrace of Amor Fati

In "The Rickchurian Mortydate," Beth is faced with the profound question of whether she is a clone or the original, and if her memories are her own, which impacts her future happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Given her "existential crisis and proclivity for Rick-like disillusionment-causing intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, Beth must confront her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

After being given "radical freedom to choose her destiny" by Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, Beth reconnects with Jerry by recreating one of their first dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This act, while seeming "weird" to some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, is interpreted as a manifestation of Amor Fati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Although she may have initially "hated her life the first time around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, she becomes a "Nietzschean Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, embracing her past rather than denying years of misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Amor Fati is not about pretending "everything is a blessing in disguise," but about "not to shun the ugly aspects of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Beth's acceptance of Jerry, a character she now views as "simplicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, despite his perceived flaws, allows her to find a "newfound sense of happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> and bring her family back together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Even when she believes Rick might have come to retire her, Beth functionally states, "Yes, a version of Beth may have chosen to leave, but I embrace being left with my family rather than dwell on what could have been" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. In a multiverse of infinite choices, she chooses to "stay in this one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Beth's struggle to "know herself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> and determine "who am I? What do I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> in the face of infinite possibilities, ultimately leads her to a resolution grounded in Amor Fati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Contrast with Rick's Nihilism

While Rick is often portrayed as a "Nietzschean ubermensch at war with the meaningless cosmos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, he generally doesn't "create his own new meaning as much as he just kind of dicks around in the most self destructive way possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. His response to meaninglessness is "Donâ€™t think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. In contrast, Beth, when confronted with the same cosmic meaninglessness, "finds happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, which is presented as the truly "ubermenschy" act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

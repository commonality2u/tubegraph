*The Big Bang Theory* is presented as a nuanced take on geek culture, but is instead criticized as being "profoundly bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This analysis suggests that its flaws are so deep they require philosophy to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, specifically arguing that the show demonstrates how meaning has died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## The Problem with Referentiality

A core issue identified with *The Big Bang Theory* is its extensive reliance on "referentiality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. The show frequently references cornerstones of nerd culture, such as *Star Trek* ("Sheldon's log. Star Date 63345.3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>) and *Battlestar Galactica* ("That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>), as well as scientific facts and mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. These references are used to constantly remind the audience that characters like Leonard and Sheldon are "diehard nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

However, the criticism is that these references lack substance. For instance, when Sheldon explains slipping in a bathtub using scientific terms like "low coefficient of static friction," the joke is simply the *reference* to friction, not the inherent humor of friction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. The actual science is often interchangeable; the words "humerus" and "glenoid socket" could be replaced with gibberish without most viewers noticing the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. The joke is merely *that* they are talking about science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

This superficial use of references is contrasted with the animated show *Futurama*. In *Futurama*, a reference to "aleph null" (the mathematical symbol for an infinite set of countable numbers) on a movie theater sign not only provides an "easter egg" for the mathematically inclined but also bases the joke on the *impossibility* of a theater having infinite screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Here, the joke is about the *subject* of aleph-null, and the reference "imbues the joke with additional meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. *The Big Bang Theory*, by contrast, accomplishes the opposite, using "references for the sake of references" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

## Baudrillard and the Annihilation of Reality

This issue of meaningless references is linked to the ideas of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, particularly his concept of [[simulacra_and_representation_in_popular_culture | simulacra and representation]]. Baudrillard argued that we live in a state where reality has been obliterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. He outlines four levels of representation:
1.  **First level:** A perfectly accurate representation of reality, like a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Second level:** An unfaithful copy, like a filter that obscures reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. *The Big Bang Theory* could optimistically be seen as a "distorted view of real nerd culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
3.  **Third level:** A representation that deliberately hides the absence of a reality being represented, like an artist rendering of someone they've never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. This is the more pessimistic view of *The Big Bang Theory*: "a copy of something that never existed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, with "science without actual science" and "nerd culture without real nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. The show's characters are "more like what someone who has never met a nerd thinks they’re like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
4.  **Fourth level:** Signs and representations referencing other signs and representations, where all sense of reality is lost, as seen in photoshopping photoshopped images or memes of other memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Baudrillard believed we are already living in a world of "fourth order simulacra," where "any reference to original reality is lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

According to Baudrillard, when copies of reality become their own reality, it signals "not only the death of meaning, but make all ideas interchangeable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This is reflected in *The Big Bang Theory*'s jokes, which are "apropos of nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>, allowing characters to "spew meaningless nonsense under the guise of a meaningful joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. An example is the show's fictional game, *Mystic Warlords of Ka’a*, which quickly devolves into "utter nonsense" like "Sulfur. Brimstone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. The joke functions regardless of the specific words used, as the show "selling you an empty joke under the guise of a meaningful one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

## Humor Based on Superiority

The show's humor is largely based on "sh*tting on its characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. This aligns with the "Superiority Theory" of humor, an early Western theory starting with Plato, who saw laughter as a form of scorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. Thomas Hobbes modified this, suggesting laughter comes from our competitive nature, triumphing over others or witnessing their downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. Even Descartes viewed laughter as scorn "proceed[ing] from our perceiving some small evil in a person whom we consider to be deserving of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. All three agree that laughter often comes at the expense of others, making us feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

However, unlike shows like *Seinfeld* where characters are "horrible people deserving our scorn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>, *The Big Bang Theory*'s showrunner, Chuck Lorre, stated the show is "not about geeks or nerds, [but] about extraordinary people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. This raises the question of why these supposedly extraordinary characters are consistently mocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

## A Disservice to Nerd Culture

Ultimately, *The Big Bang Theory* is argued to tear down nerd culture rather than building it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. By mechanically inserting references "for reference’s sake," the show "reveals its contempt for real nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. The actual details of nerd culture are deemed "irrelevant" as long as the characters "sound like wanky assholes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

This approach does a disservice to nerds, from *Buffy* fans to Marvel fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. Instead of seeing themselves reflected on screen, viewers are presented with "caricatures that kinda just get dumped on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. The overall [[social_critique_using_popular_media | social critique]] suggests that the show's shallow humor and portrayal of geek culture contribute to a loss of meaning in representation.

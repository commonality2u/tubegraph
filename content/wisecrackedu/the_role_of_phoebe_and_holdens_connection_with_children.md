This connection highlights his desire to protect innocence and his struggle with the complexities of adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Phoebe's Significance
Phoebe plays a crucial role in [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]]'s journey. When [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] is at a low point, he decides to see his baby sister Phoebe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. She questions him about his aspirations, asking what he wants to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Their bond is unique; Phoebe is described as the "only one he can keep it real with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Despite [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]]'s desire to escape alone, Phoebe insists on joining him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After he refuses, she becomes upset and tells him to "shut his trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] apologizes to her and takes her to the zoo, finding joy in watching her on the carousel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This interaction underscores the genuine connection and comfort [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] finds in children's innocence.

## The Catcher in the Rye Metaphor
The central metaphor of the novel, and [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]]'s self-proclaimed role, is revealed during his conversation with Phoebe. He envisions himself in a large field of rye, filled with children, standing at a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. His purpose is to catch any "little homies who bout to fall off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This vision has both a literal and a figurative meaning:
*   **Literal**: [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] would physically save children from falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Figurative**: He aims to save children from the "bent-ass shit of adulthood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

[[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] recognizes that he cannot prevent the "pure world of children from changing to the fake-ass world of adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. However, he intends to "buck it for hisself and other little homies for as long as he can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This concept is reinforced by his thoughts on the Museum's glass cases; he desires to "freeze time" like the figures behind the glass, refusing to join the ranks of "fake-ass adults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## [[holdens_struggle_with_adulthood_and_society | Holden's Struggle with Adulthood]]
[[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]]'s deep connection with children stems from his disdain for the "broken society full of people that always be fakin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. He seeks beauty in human contact but struggles to find it in a world he perceives as ugly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This makes him one of literature's loneliest characters, as he "keeps it so real, while errybody else frontinâ€™" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Despite his tough exterior, [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] possesses a gentle soul, evident in his concern for the ducks in Central Park Lake during winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Ultimately, this sensitivity in a world of deceit leads to his hospitalization in a psych ward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

William Golding's *Lord of the Flies* is an [[allegorical_themes_in_lord_of_the_flies|allegorical]] work that explores the origins of societal problems in human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Within this narrative, two prominent symbols are the conch and Piggy's glasses, both representing key aspects of civilization and its eventual decline.

## The Conch

Upon crash-landing on a remote island, the surviving British boys, including Ralph and Piggy, discover a large shell they call "the conch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This shell is initially used to gather the boys and conduct meetings, establishing a form of order and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The conch functions as a symbol of:
*   **Order and Authority:** It is used by leaders like Ralph to call assemblies and maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Even Jack uses it to gather the group when making important announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Civilized Rules:** The conch represents the structured "bidness" of decision-making and democratic process among the boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The ultimate destruction of the conch occurs when Piggy is thrown off a cliff, and the conch shatters along with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This event is part of a recurring motif of "falling" throughout the book, emphasizing the "fall of humankind" and the collapse of order into savagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Piggy's Glasses

Piggy's glasses are initially essential for the boys to create fire, serving as the sole means to ignite flames on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The glasses symbolize:
*   **Reason and Intellect:** The "loss of Piggyâ€™s sight" when his glasses are stolen is explicitly stated to symbolize the "fall of reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Technological Advancement/Control over Nature:** Their use in making fire represents humanity's ability to harness knowledge and technology for survival and progress.

When Jack and his group steal Piggy's glasses to make their own fire for their gang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, this act signifies a critical turning point. It "indicates the transition from the reign of reason to the reign of savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, demonstrating how even tools of reason can be co-opted and used to further base, destructive instincts.

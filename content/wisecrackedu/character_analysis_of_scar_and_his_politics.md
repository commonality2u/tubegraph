Scar is the brother of Mufasa and a central antagonist in *The Lion King* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He is depicted as a character who actively rejects the established feudal society of the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Character Traits and Motivation

Scar is the only animal in the film shown with a visible head wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. His initial appearance shows him picking up a mouse and lamenting that "life isnâ€™t fair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. He rebels against the "natural" societal order because it labels him a weakling, contrasting him with characters like Mufasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Scar desires Mufasa dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, and orchestrates Mufasa's death by convincing him to enter a wildebeest moshpit where he is trampled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He then tricks Simba into believing Mufasa's death was Simba's fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, leading Simba to run away and leave the throne to Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Political Reign and Consequences

Upon gaining power, Scar introduces what appears to be a more egalitarian era, allowing hyenas to be on equal footing with lions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. However, his politics are not entirely altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. His song about establishing a new world order incorporates Nazi marching imagery and camera movements taken from Leni Reifenstahl's *Triumph of the Will* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Much like Adolf Hitler's reign, Scar's rule quickly deteriorates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. By disrupting the natural order of the food chain, his once-prosperous kingdom descends into anarchy and starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Eventually, Simba returns to confront Scar, forcing him to submit before throwing him to the wolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

South Park, known for its unpredictable and imaginative nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, shifted its signature standalone episodes to embrace season-long serialization for three seasons, which was largely successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Season 19 effectively blended [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]], advertising, and gentrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, Season 20, with its ambitious storyline involving the presidential election, member berries, and [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire_and_internet_culture | internet trolling]], reportedly fizzled out into confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The challenges faced by Season 20 highlight how real-world political events can significantly impact a show's narrative structure.

## South Park's "Golden Rule" of Storytelling

The show's writing adheres to a strict plot line rule: a good narrative avoids using "and then" between plot beats, instead preferring "but" or "therefore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This ensures a cause-and-effect relationship, where each action is a consequence or reaction to the previous one, maintaining momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. For example, in the "Mormon episode": an annoyingly perfect Mormon kid moves to town, *therefore* he pisses everyone off, *therefore* Stan decides to kick his ass, *but* the kid is so nice, *therefore* Stan doesn't beat him up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## The Impact of the 2016 Presidential Election

Matt Stone and Trey Parker (Stone and Parker), the creators of South Park, expected Hillary Clinton ("turd sandwich") to win the 2016 US presidential election and planned Season 20's series around that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. When [[south_parks_portrayal_of_trump | Mr. Garrison]] ("giant douche") unexpectedly won, the creators had to undertake desperate last-minute rewrites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This unforeseen political event caused the show to start breaking its core storytelling rules, leading to a "cluster f**k of and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Member Berries Plotline

Initially, the member berries plotline adhered to the "golden rule":
*   Randy tries member berries, *therefore* he realizes they are dangerous brainwashing germs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   [[south_parks_portrayal_of_trump | Mr. Garrison]], leading in polls, realizes he has no plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   *Therefore*, [[south_parks_portrayal_of_trump | Mr. Garrison]] tries to sabotage his campaign for Hillary to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   His voters catch on, *therefore* Randy tells [[south_parks_portrayal_of_trump | Garrison]] the truth about nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   *Therefore*, they set out to destroy member berries, *but* they won't die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   *Therefore*, Randy convinces [[south_parks_portrayal_of_trump | Mr. Garrison]] to denounce nostalgia in a speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

This setup perfectly aligned with a planned Hillary victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. However, after Hillary lost, the narrative became convoluted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>:
*   [[south_parks_portrayal_of_trump | Mr. Garrison]] wins anyway, *and then* Caitlin Jenner reinfects them with member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   Randy and [[south_parks_portrayal_of_trump | Garrison]] trip on nostalgia, forget their quest, and get stoked on [[south_parks_portrayal_of_trump | Garrison]]'s victory, effectively "rewinding" the plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   Member berries magically turn into a vomit-inducing virus, *and then* they visit a 1920s nightclub, *and then* they are revealed to be Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. The show failed to offer justification for these transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

### Trolling Plotline

The [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire_and_internet_culture | trolling]] subplot also suffered. Initially, Gerald's trolling angered the Danes, *therefore* the Danes threatened to release internet history, causing panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Hillary Clinton, expecting to win, feared her online activities would be leaked, *therefore* she needed Gerald to save her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

After her loss, the narrative crumbled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>:
*   Clinton confusingly recruits Gerald anyway with a vague mission to infiltrate troll trace, despite her presidency no longer being at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. This scene felt disjointed, likely recycled from the "if Hillary had won" version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
*   The plot was salvaged by revealing Clinton's claim was a ruse to kidnap American trolls for email protection, *and then* the Danes were just trolling the American trolls, *and then* the top Danish guy was also just a giant troll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

This created a "random progression of events that build without any apparent logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. The writers themselves openly complained about the narrative hole, acknowledging they were dealing with "trolling and internet stuff over and over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

### Lost Potential and Abandoned Storylines

The unexpected election outcome also meant abandoning promising themes and subplots:
*   **Internet Fragmentation**: The season had analyzed how the internet fragmented public and private selves and allowed anonymous bad behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. This built towards a promising conclusion that never arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.
*   **Outrage Cycles**: The show brilliantly skewered the outrage cycles dominating [[analysis_of_south_parks_approach_to_satire_and_internet_culture | internet culture]], a more interesting explanation for [[south_parks_portrayal_of_trump | Mr. Garrison]]'s victory than member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. However, this idea was underdeveloped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
*   **First Gentleman's Club**: In an alternate reality where Hillary won, the focus would have been on Bill Clinton as the terrified First Gentleman, escalating the battle of the sexes at South Park Elementary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. This plotline, which would have added poignancy to Cartman's fear of his girlfriend Heidi, was understandably abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

## Future of South Park's Format

The creators hinted at "the end of serialization as we know it" in the Season 20 finale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. While serialization in seasons 18 and 19 led to some of South Park's best work, the challenges of Season 20 due to political unpredictability may prompt a return to standalone episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. The show's ultimate solution to the convoluted plotlines was to "blow everything up," deleting internet histories and destroying the cause-and-effect relationships built throughout the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

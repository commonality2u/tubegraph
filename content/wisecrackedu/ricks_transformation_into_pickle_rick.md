The *Rick and Morty* episode "Pickle Rick" (Season 3, Episode 3) features Rick Sanchez transforming himself into a pickle, a decision that serves multiple narrative and thematic purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Reasons for the Transformation

The initial idea for Rick's pickle transformation came from co-creator Dan Harmon, who simply suggested "Rick is a pickle" during a writer's room brainstorming session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. On a more literal plot level, Rick turns himself into a pickle to avoid attending a family therapy session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Episode Summary

In the episode, Rick successfully transforms into a pickle to skip family therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. His plan goes awry, leading him to fight his way out of a sewer and later a Russian embassy, using a mech suit constructed from roach parts and rat limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Meanwhile, Beth, Summer, and Morty are forced to attend therapy due to Summer huffing pottery enamel and Morty peeing his pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

A parallel is drawn between Rick and Beth, as both go to extreme lengths to avoid emotional vulnerability in therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Dr. Wong, the school-appointed therapist, observes that the dynamic between Beth and Rick may punish emotion and vulnerability, impacting Beth's marriage and her children's ability to express their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Thematic Significance: Freedom and Choice

This season of *Rick and Morty* places more emphasis on [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | serialized arcs]] and [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Rick's avoidance behavior, such as staying in a Mad Max-like world to avoid his daughter's divorce or literally becoming a pickle to escape reality, highlights his unwillingness to deal with personal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Morty and Summer also appear increasingly damaged by their parents' divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

A key theme emerging from this episode is freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Dr. Wong's quote to Rick highlights this:
> "I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here. You chose to talk. To belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. Each of us gets to choose." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>

Initially, Rick's perceived omnipotence might suggest he is always in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. However, the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre provides a deeper understanding. For Sartre, the absence of God implies radical freedom to define one's own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Acting based on social pressures or perceived obligations, rather than genuine choice, is what Sartre calls "bad faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Sartre also proposed "finitude," the concept that there's a fixed amount of choices in life, and each choice precludes other possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Denying the importance of these finite choices is another form of bad faith, often seen when individuals pretend not to have a choice, blaming external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Rick, however, faces the opposite challenge: infinitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. With access to infinite timelines and realities, Rick believes he doesn't need to be attached or take responsibility for his choices, as infinite versions of himself have already made them all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. He has transcended the human condition of finite choices through science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Despite his "god-like intelligence," Dr. Wong argues that justifying actions with the multiverse is not a solution, as the individual still has to make the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Rick's intelligence is used to justify the sickness affecting his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Even as the "master of his universe," Rick paradoxically struggles to accept his own unique choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. As Dr. Wong states, "The only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Rick's advice from Season 1, "What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is 'don't think about it!'" illustrates his strategy for dealing with infinite choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Turning into a pickle is Rick's way to avoid choice, or at least the appearance of it, by feigning helplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This deliberate disregard for his choices is, in Sartre's terms, acting in bad faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

This episode contributes to the season's exploration of agency, contrasting [[psychological_analysis_of_rick_and_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry's powerlessness]] with Rick's self-proclaimed omnipotence and control over his environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Speculative Interpretation

A more speculative interpretation suggests that the pickle, a phallic object, being the form Rick chooses to avoid therapy, might be a subtle nod to the Freudian concept of "everything is a penis" and a deliberate connection between a phallic object and therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

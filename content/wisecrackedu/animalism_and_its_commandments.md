After the animals successfully overthrow Farmer Jones and rename Manor Farm to [[plot_summary_of_animal_farm | Animal Farm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, they establish a new doctrine called Animalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Core Principle

The foundational tenet of Animalism is declared as: "All animals are equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Corruption and Transformation

Over time, the original "seven commandments of Animalism" begin to be subtly twisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This gradual corruption culminates in a single, altered commandment: "all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

This transformation illustrates the [[themes_of_power_and_corruption_in_animal_farm | corrupting influence of power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, as the pigs eventually begin to behave exactly like the humans they initially overthrew, walking on two legs and wielding "whips of oppression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The story suggests that the revolution, in a literal sense, ends where it began, with new oppressors replacing the old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

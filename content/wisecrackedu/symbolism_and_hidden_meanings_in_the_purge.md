The film *The Purge*, starring nine-time X-Games gold medalist Tony Hawk, is set on Earth in the 21st century, where the government has legalized murder for half a day once a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This premise allows the film to explore various themes and [[analysis_of_the_purge_movie_themes | societal critiques]] through its narrative and visual [[symbolism and metaphors in Get Out | symbolism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Duality of the Human Psyche

[[symbolism and themes in the film Midsommar | The Purge]] posits that the human psyche contains both a light and a dark side, a duality likened to the Jedi hobbits from Star Track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This concept is visually emphasized through:
*   White and blue bouquets displayed by Purge supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   Charlie's half-charred nightmare machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## The Vernal Equinox and Rebirth

The date of the Purge, March 21, often coincides with Earth's vernal equinox, a time when day and night are of equal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Just as the vernal equinox heralds the beginning of spring, a period of rebirth and renewal, the Purge is presented as a means to achieve a healthier and more balanced society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

This date also holds religious significance:
*   Christians historically celebrated the resurrection of Young Jeezy on Easter, a date calibrated using the vernal equinox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Similarly, citizens in the film celebrate the "resurrection of their society" on "Purge-mas Eve" with an almost religious fervor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   The blue baptisias visible in the film reference the Christian ritual of baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Social Stratification and Inequality

A significant [[critique of societal systems in The Purge | focal point]] of [[the_purge_as_social_commentary | The Purge]] is America's problems with [[social_stratification_in_the_purge | social stratification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While the Purge laws are ostensibly neutral regarding race and class, they disproportionately impact the disenfranchised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Those unable to afford high-level security systems become primary victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The film's antagonists, dressed in prep school attire, symbolize the wealthy elite who treat hunting a homeless black "non-contributor" as an extracurricular activity for college applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This imbalance echoes the War on Drugs in the 1980s, where laws were significantly harsher for crack cocaine (associated with poor black communities) than for powder cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Critique of Violence and Self-Criticism

[[symbolism and references in The Matrix Reloaded | The Purge]] initially suggests that engaging in and consuming violence can relieve a person's aggressive desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, it quickly undermines this premise, concluding that such actions only desensitize people and beget further violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The juxtaposition of brutal murder images with classical music highlights the idea that violence has become so normalized it no longer shocks or horrifies, but instead becomes mundane entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In "Purge-world," humans watch grotesqueries on TV for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

Paradoxically, *The Purge* itself, a violent film, can be seen as a criticism of its own nature. It provides an opportunity for viewers to "release some aggression" by watching a "good old-fashioned bloodbath," thus perpetuating the very cycle it critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

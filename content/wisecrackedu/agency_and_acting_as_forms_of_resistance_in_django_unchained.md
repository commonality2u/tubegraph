Quentin Tarantino's *Django Unchained* offers a nuanced [[django_unchaineds_commentary_on_slavery_and_racism | criticism of slavery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Beyond its typical stylistic hallmarks, the film explores how enslaved individuals could exert agency, particularly through "acting" and strategic performances, to challenge the logic of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

## Agency in Slavery

Academic debate surrounds the question of agency during slavery, with some perspectives suggesting humanity was completely stripped, while others explore the freedoms slaves managed to exert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. Historical examples of resistance, both small and large, include work slowdowns, arson, and murder, though retaliation for such acts was horrific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. *Django Unchained* showcases how acting becomes a primary means for characters to assert agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.

## Django's Performance of Freedom

Django's journey to rescue his wife, Broomhilde, involves adopting a fabricated persona, which Schultz meticulously prepares him for: "You will playing a character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:10">[14:45:10]</a>. This extends to his "Musketeer" wardrobe, which is deliberately abrasive to those who would reserve such attire for a "white civilized man of culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This deliberate choice and his horseback riding, historically associated with the well-to-do, draws ire and surprise from those around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. This use of "disidentification"—mangling the symbols of slavery from within—is a key element of [[symbolic_subversion_and_cultural_appropriation_in_django_unchained | symbolic subversion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

Within this role, Django is compelled to make difficult decisions, such as berating other enslaved people, lashing out at Calvin Candie’s crew, and even appearing to approve of a runaway slave being torn apart by dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. These choices are depicted not as acts of hatred but as necessities for his own survival within the limited scope of agency granted to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Later, Django employs his acting skills to outsmart a gang of Australians, using a handbill as a prop to put on a convincing performance that leads them to literally hand him a gun, allowing him to regain his freedom and complete his mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

## Stephen's Calculated Performance

Perhaps the most striking example of agency through acting is seen in Stephen, Candie’s head house slave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. Stephen's hatred for Django likely stems from envy, as Django achieves freedom by breaking the system, while Stephen has worked within it to gain as much power as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

Stephen has "performed his way" out of harsh field labor into the relative comfort of Candie’s home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. His performances include:
*   **Verbal Assertiveness**: He reaches a point where he can "snap back and disagree with his master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.
*   **Feigned Amusement**: Stephen laughs excessively at Candie’s jokes, a calculated act to gain trust and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. This influence is evident when he, not Candie, discerns Schultz and Django's true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Verbal Deception**: Stephen performs a fake limp and uses a fake cane to appear physically weak, disarming any suspicions about his skill or power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.

While Stephen is depicted as a villain who serves his master's interests over those of his fellow slaves, the film contextualizes his villainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. He is trying to manifest his own power with the limited "cards he was dealt," lacking the opportunity for external liberation that Django receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

Through these characters, *Django Unchained* provides a sharp [[django_unchaineds_commentary_on_slavery_and_racism | criticism of slavery]] and white supremacy, illustrating how individuals, even within oppressive systems, can employ "acting" as a powerful, albeit complex, form of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

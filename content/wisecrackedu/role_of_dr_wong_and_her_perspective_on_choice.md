In the *Rick and Morty* episode "Pickle Rick," Dr. Wong serves as a pivotal character who offers a profound perspective on [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_morty | freedom and choice]], directly confronting Rick and Beth's avoidance mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As a school-appointed therapist, Dr. Wong highlights the deep-seated issues within the Smith family, particularly the shared tendency between Rick and Beth to externalize blame and avoid personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Rick and Beth's Avoidance

The episode establishes a clear parallel between Rick and Beth: both go to extreme lengths to avoid confronting their emotions in therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Rick transforms himself into a pickle to escape family therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, while Beth actively stonewalls Dr. Wong and maintains emotional distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Dr. Wong observes that the dynamic between Beth and her father "doesn't reward emotion or vulnerability" and may even punish them, contributing to the erosion of Beth's marriage and infecting her children with a tendency to "misdirect their feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Rick's actions, such as staying in "Mad Max land" to avoid his daughter's divorce in a previous episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, and literally turning into a pickle to "run away from reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, exemplify his chronic avoidance of personal accountability.

## Dr. Wong's Core Philosophy

Dr. Wong's perspective on choice is encapsulated in her direct address to Rick:
> "I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here. You chose to talk. To belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. Each of us gets to choose." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

This monologue challenges Rick's perceived omnipotence and self-delusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Despite Rick's ability to "do anything, including turn himself into a pickle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, Dr. Wong asserts that his intelligence and power do not absolve him of personal choice and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Dr. Wong and Sartrean Existentialism

Dr. Wong's insights align with the philosophy of Jean Paul Sartre, particularly his ideas on radical freedom and "bad faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Sartre argued that godlessness means individuals are "radically free to define our own existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. To act in "bad faith" is to deny this freedom by making choices based on social pressures or pretending not to have a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Examples include blaming upbringing for one's actions, as depicted in "West Side Story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Rick, however, deals with "infinitude" rather than Sartre's concept of "finitude" (a fixed amount of choices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Given his access to infinite timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, Rick believes he doesn't need to take responsibility for his choices because he's "already made them all in the infinite versions of himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. He has transcended the "human condition" of finite choices with science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

However, Dr. Wong asserts that justifying one's actions with the multiverse or "god-like intelligence" is not a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. She critiques Rick's misuse of intelligence:
> "The only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family, is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

Despite being the "master of his universe," Rick paradoxically struggles to come to terms with his own choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Dr. Wong's crucial point is that "no matter how many versions of Rick exist, nothing can stop the fact that his choices are uniquely his own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Rick's Avoidance of Choice

Rick's transformation into a pickle is presented as an ultimate act of avoiding choice and personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. By appearing as a "helpless, armless pickle," Rick creates the illusion that he cannot attend therapy, thus absolving himself of fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This deliberate disregard for his choices, as Sartre would describe it, is acting in "bad faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Dr. Wong's role is to dismantle this self-deception, forcing Rick to confront the truth that his "mind [is] within [his] control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, and that all his actions, even turning into a pickle, are deliberate choices. The season's emphasis on "ideas of agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> is largely explored through Dr. Wong's unflinching analysis of Rick's behavior.

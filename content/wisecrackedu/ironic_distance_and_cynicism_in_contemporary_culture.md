Deadpool, a Marvel character who is an overt ripoff of a DC competitor, has achieved unprecedented popularity in mainstream media, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever and the biggest opening for Ryan Reynolds [00:00:14]. This success is notable because the film shirks the traditional superhero formula, avoiding notions of fighting for the greater good, selflessness, or being family-friendly [00:00:26]. Deadpool's popularity reflects a growing trend in media that, while seemingly new, has historical roots [00:00:51].

## Deadpool as a Postmodern Work

Deadpool distinguishes itself from other Marvel characters through several defining features:
*   He is an "inveterate wiseass" [00:01:12].
*   He is aware of his status as a superhero and constantly breaks the fourth wall, commenting on comic book tropes and culture [00:01:17].
*   He takes nothing seriously [00:01:33].

Even the film's ad campaign was conceived in a "Deadpoolian fashion," with Valentine's Day ads trolling partners and creating self-referential jokes, including a Tinder profile [00:01:38].

The best way to describe Deadpool is as a [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodern]] work [00:01:52]. [[postmodernism_in_comedy | Postmodernism]] is an artistic and philosophical movement that typically rejects the grand narratives used to understand the world, such as the battle of good versus evil, the inherent promise of technological progress, or divine salvation [00:01:57]. [[postmodernism_in_comedy | Postmodern]] works tend to disregard tradition and embrace being "meta" and self-referential [00:02:14].

Deadpool is "hyper-aware of himself and his place in the superhero genre" [00:02:23]. The film includes numerous self-referential jokes about Ryan Reynolds, such as references to "The Green Lantern," his face on *People Magazine's* "Sexiest Man Alive," or the face of his "vastly more appreciated counterpart" also on the magazine [00:02:29]. While the grand narrative in superhero films is the triumph of good over evil, Deadpool, in true [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodern]] style, dismisses this, opting for a plot centered on revenge and love rather than a universal battle [00:02:44].

This tension between traditional narratives and [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodernism]] is evident throughout the film:
*   Colossus repeatedly tries to rope Deadpool into the role of a "good superhero," family-friendly and righteous [00:03:08].
*   The Dopinder subplot subverts classic narratives of courtly love, favoring kidnapping over chivalry [00:03:24].
*   Even Blind Al is a "deranged version of a classic narrative," where a deformed protagonist finds refuge with a benevolent blind benefactor [00:03:37].
*   The love interest, Vanessa, is not a "fair maiden" but a prostitute turned stripper [00:03:48].

### Historical Parallels with Don Quixote
Deadpool can be seen as a spiritual successor to *Don Quixote*, a 400-year-old novel that also satirized the heroes of its era, employed meta-narratives, and is considered by some to be a proto-[[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodern]] work [00:03:57]. *Don Quixote* features a story within a story, with a fictional author discovering accounts of Don Quixote [00:04:12]. Don Quixote is aware he is being written about, and the fictional author frequently breaks the fourth wall [00:04:24]. At one point, the story abruptly cuts off with the author claiming the rest was lost [00:04:28].

*Don Quixote* was written during a period when "radical skepticism of the existing order started to bud in popular society," just before the Enlightenment [00:04:44]. The novel sought to "have a few laughs at the expense of Spanish society," rather than invent a new ideology [00:04:57]. Similarly, Deadpool "signals a similar disenchantment with all those old righteous narratives in our society" [00:05:04].

## Ironic Distance and Cynicism in Contemporary Culture

Joss Whedon, known for self-aware titles like *Firefly*, *Buffy*, and *The Avengers*, critiques modern culture through the lens of *Indiana Jones* [00:05:16]. In *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom*, a scene where Indiana reaches for his gun but finds it missing, then delivers a "shit-eating-grin" to the audience, exemplifies a self-referential moment "for the sake of self-reference" that Whedon believes has "engulfed our culture" [00:05:35].

This self-awareness is increasingly taking a cynical tone, becoming pervasive in film, television, and literature [00:06:06]. Examples include:
*   A *Tarzan* trailer where Jane overtly references her "tired role of a damsel in distress," with the film acknowledging recycled tropes but merely apologizing for them instead of innovating [00:06:10].
*   *Star Trek Into Darkness* concludes with a scene that is "just an excuse to say 'Hey - remember this great scene in cinema? Now it’s opposite day!'" [00:06:34].
*   *22 Jump Street* features the "same exact plot as *21 Jump Street*," which is deemed acceptable because the audience can collectively identify with Ice Cube calling out the "bullshit" [00:06:49].

This trend has escalated to "self-effacement," where Hollywood, described as a "decrepit machine fueled by the ideas of yesteryear," acknowledges its "lazy cliches with a wink and a nod" or uses irony to undercut dramatic moments [00:07:05].

Deadpool embodies both approaches, breaking the fourth wall to include the audience in the joke and avoiding serious drama "like the plague" [00:07:38]. Hollywood maintains familiar structures and tropes but "distances the audience from any kind of sincerity so that it feels new" [00:07:44]. This leads to a question: is this "Hollywood version of #sorrynotsorry gratifying for the viewer, or have we just come to terms with the fact that there is nothing new to say?" [00:07:59].

### Deadpool's Cynical Humor and Identity
Deadpool's humor is largely driven by this "sense of cynicism and ironic distance" [00:08:08]. He remains unphased in high-stakes situations, whether being tortured or about to be gruesomely maimed, and even combat scenes are undercut by self-aware humor [00:08:12]. His immunity to criticism stems from his definition by cynicism [00:08:30]. He "relentlessly deconstructs any trope that would endow meaning to film" [00:08:34].

Deadpool's journey is primarily about "Wade Wilson’s journey to become hot again," a "shallow endeavor" even if it's to reclaim his lost love [00:08:42]. He "evades criticism because he has no moral scruples or values to defend" [00:08:57]. His identity is "purely reactionary," risking nothing and simply making fun of everything [00:09:02].

The film itself "has 0 fucks to give," with its ad campaign not taking itself seriously and the movie pointing out its own flaws, such as the overuse of superhero tropes or obvious budgetary constraints [00:09:12]. For instance, Negasonic Teenage Warhead is described as the "Marvel Universe equivalent of a Walmart bargain bin DVD" [00:09:30]. However, the question remains whether the film's self-awareness and "sort of apolog[y] for its lacking qualities" makes it inherently good [00:09:43].

The danger of this trend is that it "never creates anything," leading to an "endless spiral of meta" [00:10:04]. Deadpool is compared to hipsters, a cultural movement that "ironically loves the cliche, endlessly recycles culture and constantly positions itself against the mainstream" [00:10:19]. Douglas Haddow noted the danger of hipsters as "the end of Western civilization itself, 'a culture lost in the superficiality of its past and unable to create any new meaning'" [00:10:29]. Deadpool doesn't reinvent the superhero genre; it can only exist to mock it [00:10:40].

### Powerlessness of Cynicism
The fundamental problem with Deadpool and similar films is that "bashing the system may feel good, it may make us laugh, but it’s ultimately powerless—it doesn’t change the system at all" [00:10:50]. Slavoj Zizek argues that "cynical distance, laughter, irony, are, so to speak, part of the game. The ruling ideology is not meant to be taken seriously or literally" [00:11:00].

Hipsters believe they are countercultural by adopting ironic trends like PBR and mustaches [00:11:11]. Deadpool, similarly, "fancies itself a countercultural movie by celebrating its own played-out cliches and an overused storyline" [00:11:17]. This cultural impasse reflects a society that "doesn’t quite know what to do with itself," having achieved global dominance in culture but not facing immediate collapse [00:11:28].

Deadpool's ability to say "Fuck it" stems from his immunity to death and consequences [00:11:42]. If life becomes "limitless," can it be sacred [00:11:46]? The film's "fuck it" attitude, where "no consequences" exist, mirrors the comic book's origin, where creators felt the comic was on the verge of cancellation and decided to write as if nothing mattered [00:12:02]. If society as a whole can say "fuck it," it might be because "death or really any real existential threat has become either so distance, or so close that we no longer care" [00:12:19].

The question remains whether Deadpool merely applies a "shiny makeover over the same old shit" through fourth-wall breaking, or if it genuinely achieves something new beyond being "the ultimate cynical film" [00:12:28].

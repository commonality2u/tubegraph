The final installment of The Matrix trilogy, *The Matrix Revolutions*, raises fundamental questions about [[predestination_vs_free_will | free will]] and [[determinism_in_the_matrix_reloaded | determinism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The film explores whether Neo makes his own choices or is merely a pawn of larger forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Given the philosophical depth attributed to the films, the answers may lie in the philosophies that inspired them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Recap of Neo's Journey
In *The Matrix*, Neo awakens from a simulated reality, learning that machines control the world and that he is prophesized to save humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, in *The Matrix Reloaded*, these expectations are subverted with the revelation that Neo is not special, and the prophecy was part of the machines' scheme all along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. *The Matrix Revolutions* sees Neo cooperating with the machines to defeat Agent Smith, saving both humans and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## The Conflict of Choice and Determinism
The conflict between choice and [[determinism_in_the_matrix_reloaded | determinism]] is a recurring theme in the trilogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Key dialogue emphasizes this tension:
> Causality. Action, reaction. Cause and effect. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
> Everything begins with choice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>
> No. Wrong. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
Neo's last spoken word is "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Most people experience themselves as making choices, such as writing videos because they choose to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. For Aristotle, humans are rational animals whose reason enables them to make choices and differentiates them from other animals and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The ability to act otherwise, rather than being driven by instinct or programming, is essential for something to be called a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. David Hume suggests that the ability to act or not act according to one's own desires and reason is the basis of human freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Neo, Morpheus, and others agree with this perspective, resenting how humans are treated like machines with controlled minds and bodies while plugged into the Matrix, lacking the capacity to act otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The overarching narrative of the series aims towards gaining freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Choice as an Illusion within the System
However, the reality is more complex. Neo and his allies initially don't realize that freedom of choice is actually an integral part of the Matrix itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. In a cryptic conversation, the Architect reveals that earlier versions of the Matrix failed because humans were being forced, despite living in a perfect world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Humans valued choice even over perfect happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
> The first matrix was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> It was a disaster. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
The current Matrix functions because it accounts for the human need to choose, even if it's a paradoxical choice to give up their freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Approximately 99% of test subjects accept the program as long as they are given a choice, even if only at an unconscious level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This concept aligns with Jean Baudrillard's idea that humans willingly give up control of meaning to the virtual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

This integration of choice creates anomalies within the system, including Neo and his five predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Human choice introduces aspects of the Architect's plan that cannot be predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. When Neo chooses to save Trinity instead of reloading the Matrix, it appears to be a triumph of [[predestination_vs_free_will | free will]] over [[determinism_in_the_matrix_reloaded | determinism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Doubts about Neo's Free Will
Despite appearances, there are reasons to doubt if Neo truly makes a genuine choice:
*   **Passions over Reason**: Aristotle and Aquinas considered passions like love, anger, and jealousy to be "kryptonite" to choice and [[predestination_vs_free_will | free will]], viewing them as mere animal impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The Architect believes Neo's return to Trinity is simply the result of another causal law: love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He views love as a chemical reaction designed to overwhelm logic and reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, suggesting Neo is responding to basic evolutionary programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Mechanistic Determinism**: Philosophers like René Descartes and Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot believed everything is mechanistic, implying that humans operate on physical, logical, and mathematical laws of causation, without true choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This [[determinism_in_the_matrix_reloaded | determinism]] dates back to ancient philosophers like Democritus and Leucippus, who noted the physical world was governed by strict causal laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Determinists argue that the appearance of choice is merely part of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Once the Architect understood the human need to *feel* like they're making choices, he simply integrated this into his deterministic calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **The Cycle of The One**: The function of The One is to control the narrative of choice and resistance in a way that benefits the machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Humans are trapped in a cycle where they believe they are escaping, but Zion rises, The One appears, meets the Architect, chooses, and most people die, only for the Matrix to reload, rinse, and repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Fatalism**: Even if Neo's love for Trinity is genuine, fatalism suggests events are destined to occur due to divine will, fate, or even one's own character and compulsions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Thomas Aquinas believed that while choice exists, it's [[predestination_vs_free_will | free will]] that makes humans sensitive to moral goals and responsible for their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### The Oracle's Influence
The Oracle is central to this fatalistic perspective, being the architect of the prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. If the prophecy is merely a mechanism to manage the anomaly and guide Neo to the Source, then the Oracle is manipulating Neo and his allies into nearly every one of their decisions, even feigning choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This implies that the Oracle and the Architect are engaged in a game of chess, controlling all the strings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
> You create a very dangerous game. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>
However, even the Oracle's choices are questioned: does she truly make her own choices, or is she also a product of fate and [[determinism_in_the_matrix_reloaded | determinism]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> While by Aristotle's and Aquinas' definitions, she appears to make choices (e.g., saving Sati and allowing Agent Smith to clone her) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, she also states these actions were to fulfill her purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a> and "had to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This leaves the question of her own [[predestination_vs_free_will | free will]] ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### Agent Smith's Fatalism
Agent Smith, ironically, might be the only character with true agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. When killed by Neo, he refuses to return to the Source to be destroyed, making a choice similar to Neo's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Yet, Smith views himself as a die-hard fatalist, believing his actions are part of a grander plan, not a matter of [[predestination_vs_free_will | will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
> We're not here because we're here, because we are not free. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a> There is no escaping reason, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a> no denying purpose, because as we both know, without purpose, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a> we would not exist. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>
Smith is convinced his purpose is to kill Neo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> and believes freedom, truth, peace, and love are illusions, as meaningless as the Matrix itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. For Smith, only programming and fate are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, rendering human lives empty because they are not programmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

### The Enduring Value of Connection and Freedom
Despite Smith's fatalism, the film eventually reminds viewers that the desire for freedom, peace, and love holds meaning for both humans and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. The connection implied by love is powerful and meaningful, not just a chemical reaction or illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The concept of freedom, specifically the freedom to act otherwise, is equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

Sati, a program without a purpose, embodies this ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. While programs are typically deleted if they lack a purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, her life is still deemed worth living, and she deserves to be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This insight leads Neo to realize that not just humanity, but also some programs, need saving from the war, suggesting that true choice must extend to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. However, this revelation itself is orchestrated by the Oracle, who sent Sati and her family to Neo at that precise moment to guide him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This again implies the Oracle's control over events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Resolution in Ambiguity
Ultimately, after much discussion of choice, it remains unclear whether Neo or anyone else truly makes one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. *The Matrix Revolutions* concludes with confusing religious imagery, presenting Neo as a glowing, jacked-in Jesus figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This may be explained in terms of choice versus fate, but also **faith** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Neo is a quasi-religious figure, echoing the Gnostic Gospels, who spoke of a savior guiding individuals to the nature of reality and saving them through "waking knowledge" from perceived darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Neo's sacrifice enables true knowledge and peace, driven by faith in his purpose and the possibility of peace, even when he is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. The faith of other characters also plays a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

> [!info] The Power of Faith
> The religious imagery suggests that some things exist beyond reason, clarity, or calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. Perhaps part of what makes humans is the capacity for faith in peace, goodness, and something beyond themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### [[interpretation_of_yin_and_yang_in_the_context_of_the_matrix | Yin and Yang]]
A subtle detail, the Oracle's earrings, hints at a philosophy of [[interpretation_of_yin_and_yang_in_the_context_of_the_matrix | yin and yang]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This Taoist and Confucian philosophy is reflected in themes of balance, cycles, and dichotomies within the films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:20:06]</a>. Yin represents a dark, condensing force (associated with metal, fire, and the material world), while yang is associated with light, expanding forces (water, earth, chi, and life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. The real world in *Revolutions* is dark, mechanical, and fiery, while the virtual world is light and of the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

However, [[interpretation_of_yin_and_yang_in_the_context_of_the_matrix | yin and yang]] are not strict dichotomies but interconnected, opposite forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. This explains why Agent Smith and Neo have unexplained powers and obsess over each other: they are [[interpretation_of_yin_and_yang_in_the_context_of_the_matrix | yin and yang]], light and dark sides of the same anomaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
> He is you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a> Your opposite. Negative to be showed at the equation trying to balance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>
[[interpretation_of_yin_and_yang_in_the_context_of_the_matrix | Yin and yang]] can explain how the real and virtual worlds are two sides of the same coin, both essential for achieving peace between machines and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. Similarly, choice and fate are presented as [[interpretation_of_yin_and_yang_in_the_context_of_the_matrix | yin and yang]], equally important aspects of the human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. The film deliberately combines Eastern and Western philosophies as vital parts of its story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

The film's commitment to being "beyond sense" or flawlessly implementing each philosophy might be its own point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>: that some things are beyond reasoning and calculation, and that is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

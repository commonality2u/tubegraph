George Orwell's novel, [[summary_of_animal_farm_by_george_orwell | Animal Farm]], is not merely a story about animals; it presents a profound [[allegory_of_class_struggle_and_modern_society | allegory]] about the rise and fall of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The narrative uses animal characters and events on a farm to parallel key figures and historical moments of the Russian Revolution and subsequent Soviet regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Characters as Allegories

The animal characters in the story represent various entities and individuals from Soviet history:
*   **The Pigs** The pigs on Animal Farm symbolize the leadership of the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **[[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Napoleon]]** The pig [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Napoleon]] stands for Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **[[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]]** The pig [[character_analysis_of_napoleon_and_snowball | Snowball]] represents Leon Trotsky, a communist leader whose conflict with Stalin led to his expulsion from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Squealer** Squealer, with his persuasive rhetoric, symbolizes *Pravda*, the official newspaper that disseminated propaganda and misinformation to support Stalin's agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Old Major** Old Major is a composite figure, embodying both Karl Marx, the foundational theorist of communism, and Vladimir Lenin, the architect of the Bolshevik Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Historical Events and Parallels

Specific events in the novel mirror crucial moments in Soviet history:
*   **Old Major's Speech** Old Major's address to the animals, urging them to rebel against their human oppressors, echoes the sentiments found at the conclusion of *The Communist Manifesto* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The speech reflects the call for workers of all countries to unite, emphasizing the overthrow of existing social conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
    > "The communists openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
    > "Working men of all countries unite!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
*   **The Animal Revolt** The animals' [[animalism_and_rebellion_in_animal_farm | rebellion]] in Chapter 2, where they overthrow Farmer Jones, parallels the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, which deposed Tsar Nicholas II, represented by Mr. Jones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Human Attempts to Retake the Farm** The humans' subsequent attempts to reclaim Animal Farm in Chapter 4 symbolize the Russian Civil War (1918-1922) between the Bolsheviks and the Russian loyalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Broader Allegorical Significance

Orwell's choice to use animals for this [[themes_allegory_of_society_and_human_nature | allegory]] may also be linked to Karl Marx's philosophical writings. Marx observed that in certain human functions, the worker feels reduced to an animalistic state, blurring the lines between human and animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

> "The worker in this human functions no longer feels himself to be anything but animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

While specifically referencing the Soviet Union, *Animal Farm* also presents a broader truth about human nature: how power can corrupt, and how even well-intentioned [[animalism_and_rebellion_in_animal_farm | revolutions]] can lead to new forms of oppression, as the pigs eventually become indistinguishable from the humans they overthrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This cyclical nature highlights the irony that the revolution ultimately returns to its starting point, with new oppressors in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

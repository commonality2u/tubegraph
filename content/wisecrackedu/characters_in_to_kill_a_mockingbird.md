The narrative of *[[plot_summary_of_to_kill_a_mockingbird | To Kill a Mockingbird]]* centers on several key individuals and their interactions within a Southern setting during the Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Main Child Characters

*   **Scout**
    Scout is one of the "three little homies" around whom the book focuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Along with her brother Jem and Dill, she spends a summer "harassing a nearby shut-in named Boo Radley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. She attempts to pass Boo a note to see if he wants to "chill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A "little punk" insults her father, Atticus, by calling him a "Nigger lover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. On Halloween night, Bob Ewell attempts to "rough up" Scout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Her statement that "icing" Boo Radley would be like "Shootin' a mockingbird" is crucial to the novel's title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Initially, Scout "sport[s] all that Southern racism and ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. However, after interacting with Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, she matures and "starts keepin' it real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. By being exposed to "people of difference," she undergoes a "paradigm shiftin' moment," realizing that these individuals are "just be tryin' to hustle like anybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Jem**
    Jem is Scout's "crippled brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, who also participates in harassing Boo Radley with Scout and Dill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Bob Ewell also "gets the drop on" Jem on Halloween night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Jem's "crippled ass is a metaphor for America's jacked up justice system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. His arm injury is a "synecdoche for a country that was born with backward ass ideals," implying a "disabling scar on the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Dill**
    Dill is a "homeboy" who joins Scout and Jem in harassing Boo Radley during the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Adult Characters

He intervenes when the children try to contact Boo Radley, telling them to "Leave a brother be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. He is called a "Nigger lover" because he is hired to defend Tom Robinson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

He "gets off Scott free" because "icing him" would be like "Shootin' a mockingbird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

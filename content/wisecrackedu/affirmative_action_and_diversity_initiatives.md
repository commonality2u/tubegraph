The film *Zootopia* mirrors the social and political landscape of 20th-century America, particularly in its depiction of efforts to balance societal inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## The Mammal Inclusion Initiative

The movie features a "Mammal Inclusion Initiative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, which is presented as similar to Earthling [[the_impact_of_systemic_racism_and_societal_norms | diversity and affirmative action programs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. These programs are designed to "level the playing field for under-served minorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> and, in the case of women, majorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The parallels to real-world movements are emphasized through the use of language associated with the "PC movement," such as the phrase "Sir, I'm not just some token bunny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Idealized Solutions

Similar to the optimistic outlook often portrayed in 20th-century America, *Zootopia* suggests that its citizens can resolve all social ills merely "by trying hard and being optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This perspective implies an easy resolution to complex societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Limits of Inclusion

Despite its theme of inclusion, the film is noted for seemingly "ignor[ing] all the freaks and uggos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, such as reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and insects, which are presumably "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> in the animal kingdom depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

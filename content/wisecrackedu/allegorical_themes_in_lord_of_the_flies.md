William Golding's *Lord of the Flies* is an allegorical work that explores the origins of societal flaws within human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:07">[02:30:07]</a>. By observing a group of British boys stranded on a remote island, the narrative reminds readers of humanity's capacity for evil and suggests that man-made moral systems are ultimately superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>.

## Core Allegory: Human Nature and Society
The book begins when a G5 plane carrying British boys crashes on a Pacific island, leaving survivors including Ralph, Piggy, Jack, and Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This isolated setting allows for an examination of how society might devolve without external constraints. The narrative illustrates that the "beast" feared by the boys is not a physical monster, but rather "the violence in dem kids hearts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. This revelation underscores the core allegorical message that savagery and evil originate from within human nature itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:07">[02:30:07]</a>.

## Key Allegorical Symbols and Motifs

### The Lord of the Flies
The central [[symbolism_of_the_conch_and_piggys_glasses | symbol]] in the book is the pig's head impaled on a stick, known as "The Lord of the Flies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. This symbol is an allegory for Beelzebub, also known as the prince of demons or The Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:04">[03:14:04]</a>. The Lord of the Flies represents the "destruction, decay and demoralization of man kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:01">[03:23:01]</a>.

From a [[Freudian analysis of themes and symbols | Freudian perspective]], The Lord of the Flies can represent "the id," which functions solely to ensure survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. When the id is in charge, laws, moral codes, and even intelligence become insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### The Fall of Humankind
A recurring motif throughout the book is "falling," which emphasizes the "fall of human kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:05">[03:45:05]</a>. Examples include:
*   Piggy falling off the cliff, with the conch shattering alongside him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:07">[03:47:07]</a>.
*   The falling parachutist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   Ralph collapsing at the Naval officer's feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

### The Loss of Reason
The [[symbolism of the conch and Piggys glasses | loss of Piggy's sight]], specifically when his glasses are stolen, allegorically represents the "fall of reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. When Jack and his gang steal Piggy's glasses to make a fire, it symbolizes the transition from the "reign of reason" to the "reign of savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

## Ironic Allegory of Civilization
The "wackest irony" of the book's allegory is revealed at its conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. While the arrival of a Naval officer might seem like a return to righteous adult life, the officer himself is "smack in the middle of a war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. He was attempting to ambush an enemy when he discovered the boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This implies that "nobody to save civilized humanity from they violent nature neither" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, extending the allegory of inherent human savagery to adult society itself. The boys' innocence is "long gone" by the time they are rescued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

The episode "Get Schwifty" is a notable installment of [[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]] that delves into the complexities of belief systems, particularly religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While the show often trivializes concepts people hold dear, including religion, "Get Schwifty" offers a more nuanced exploration of how humanity rationalizes its thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## The Headist Cult and Opportunistic Religion
When a giant floating head, known as a Cromulon, appears and demands "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, Earth is plagued by natural disasters like earthquakes, sinkholes, fires, and massive flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The episode initially satirizes the opportunistic nature of organized religion, showing a church prioritizing donations and a new organ amidst global catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The "Headism" cult emerges from a "cosmic problem in point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. People are unaware that the Cromulons are merely filming a reality show requiring a hit song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This lack of information naturally leads to the formation of a cult based on misinterpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The cult's "Ascension Day" ceremony, where "unwantables" are sent to the gods, bears a resemblance to the crucifixion of Christ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Logical Fallacies Exposed
"Get Schwifty" critiques the reasoning behind belief structures by exposing common logical fallacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The episode specifically targets two fallacies that conflate correlation with causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>:

*   **Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:** This fallacy involves the mistaken belief that two things occurring at the same time are causally related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The Headist religion begins because Principal Vagina prays to the Head just as the cataclysmic events subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. In reality, the Heads stop their destruction because they are pleased with Rick's impromptu performance of "Get Schwifty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This fallacy is reiterated when Headists assume the Heads are angered by Principal Vagina's attempt to ascend Beth and Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, when in fact, the Heads are displeased with Rick's terrible performance without Morty and a nuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

*   **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:** This fallacy assumes that because one event precedes another, it must be the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. An example is when the President believes that celebrities like The Dream, Billy Corgan, Randy Newman, and Pharrell are dead simply because he named them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Aristotle was the first to compile a list of logical fallacies, aiming to identify arguments that "sounded great but are actually pure ass-clownery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The episode plays with various such fallacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Human Cognitive Biases
The episode makes a broader point that people don't simply fall into "silly beliefs out of pure irrationality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Instead, they "over rationalize their thinking to the point of absurdity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Cognitive psychologists suggest that pseudo-scientific belief systems are resilient because they are "sustained by the structure of the human brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. These systems persist and spread through appeals to rationality, not through trickery or mass stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The human brain is "hard-wired to search for logical conclusions and easy explanations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This tendency is linked to **confirmation bias**, which is the propensity to seek out and interpret information that confirms one's existing beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This bias explains why people are willing to overlook "glaring flaws" in their belief systems for personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. For example, Beth and Jerry overlook the dangers of the Headist cult because their daughter Summer is "thriving" within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Broader Critique of Post Hoc Rationalization
The fallacies and biases depicted are not unique to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. [[Philosophy and existentialism in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]] highlights that "post hoc rationalization is an inevitability of our cause and effect thought process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The audience itself can be fooled by this tendency, as shown by Rick's "snake and wristwatch trick," which plays on the brain's desire to attribute event A as the cause of event B, even when there is no actual link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

While "Get Schwifty" delivers the "tasty irony" that cosmic events leading to a religion can be based on something as inane as a reality TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, it goes a step further. The episode critiques the human ability to make predictions and comprehend the complexity of existence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This relentless critique, where "nothing is safe," not even belief, distinguishes [[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | Rick and Morty]] from contemporary satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

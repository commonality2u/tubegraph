George Orwell's *[[plot_summary_of_animal_farm | Animal Farm]]* is an allegorical novella, primarily representing the rise and fall of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Through its animal characters and events, the book parallels key figures and historical moments of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Character Allegories

*   **The Pigs**
    The pigs in *Animal Farm* collectively represent the top echelons of the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **[[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Napoleon]]** stands for Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   **[[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Snowball]]** represents Leon Trotsky, a communist leader whose conflict with Stalin led to his expulsion from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
    *   **[[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Squealer]]** embodies *Pravda*, the Soviet newspaper that disseminated propaganda and lies to the public to advance Stalin's objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   **[[character_analysis_of_napoleon_snowball_squealer_and_old_major | Old Major]]** is a composite figure, combining elements of Karl Marx, the foundational communist theorist, and Vladimir Lenin, the architect of the revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. His revolutionary preaching to the animals echoes the conclusion of Karl Marx's *Communist Manifesto* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
        > "The communists openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
        > "Working men of all countries unite!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>

## Historical Parallels in Plot

The narrative of *Animal Farm* directly mirrors significant events from Soviet history:
*   The animals' revolt in Chapter 2 parallels the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, which overthrew Tsar Nicholas II (represented by Mr. Jones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   The humans' attempt to reclaim the farm in Chapter 4 reflects the Russian Civil War (1918-1922) between the Russian loyalists (White Army) and the Bolsheviks (Red Army) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The eventual corruption of the pigs, who begin to resemble humans and oppress other animals, symbolizes the totalitarian nature of the Soviet regime and its abandonment of revolutionary ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Symbolism of Animals

Orwell's choice to use animals for this allegory relates to Karl Marx's *Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844*, which discusses the dehumanization of workers under capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
> "The worker in this human functions no longer feels himself to be anything but animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

## Broader Themes

While a specific allegory for the Soviet Union, *Animal Farm* also presents broader truths about humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. It highlights the corrupting nature of power, demonstrating how even initially righteous movements can succumb to tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The revolution on Manor Farm, despite its initial promise, ultimately concludes where it began, with new oppressors replacing the old ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

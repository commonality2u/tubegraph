The television show *The Big Bang Theory* is presented as a case study for its nuanced take on [[critique_of_the_big_bang_theorys_portrayal_of_geek_culture | geek culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the show is critically viewed as "profoundly bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, leading to an analysis of what went wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## The Problematic Use of Referentiality

*The Big Bang Theory* frequently uses referentiality, citing cornerstones of nerd culture like *Star Trek* and *Battlestar Galactica*, as well as scientific facts and mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. These references are used to constantly remind the audience that the characters, such as Leonard, Sheldon, and company, are diehard nerds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### References as the Joke Itself

The core issue identified with the show's humor is that the mere act of referencing science or geek culture is presented as the joke, rather than the content or subject of the reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, Sheldon's explanation of friction or a dislocated humerus is funny simply because it's a scientific reference, not because of any inherent humor in the scientific concept itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The actual science could be replaced with gibberish, and the audience would likely not know the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

This contrasts with other media, like *Futurama*, where a reference to "aleph null" (the mathematical symbol for an infinite set of countable numbers) not only provides an "easter egg" for the mathematically inclined but also uses the subject of the reference to convey a joke about the impossibility of infinite screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Baudrillard's Philosophy of Representation

The show's use of references is seen as a "small step toward the complete annihilation of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, a concept explored by French philosopher Jean Baudrillard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Baudrillard posited four levels of representation:
1.  **Accurate representation:** A perfect copy of reality, like a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
2.  **Unfaithful copy:** A distorted representation that obscures reality, like a filter making someone look prettier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
3.  **Hides no reality:** A representation that deliberately conceals the absence of an original reality, like an artist rendering of someone they've never seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
4.  **Simulacra:** Signs and representations reference other signs and representations, leading to a loss of all sense of original reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Applying Baudrillard's framework to *The Big Bang Theory*'s portrayal of nerd culture:
*   **Optimistic view:** The show is a distorted view of real nerd culture, representing the second order of representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Pessimistic view:** The show is a copy of something that never existed â€“ the third order of representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It presents science without actual science and "nerd culture without real nerds," portraying them as caricatures based on external perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

This type of referential humor, where the joke doesn't rely on understanding the subject but merely recognizing the reference, leads to the "death of meaning," making all ideas interchangeable and enabling the characters to "spew meaningless nonsense under the guise of a meaningful joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## The Superiority Theory of Humor

A significant aspect of *The Big Bang Theory*'s humor involves "sh*tting on its characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This aligns with the earliest Western theory of humor, the Superiority Theory.
*   **Plato** suggested laughter was a form of scorn, directed at those unaware of their perceived awfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Thomas Hobbes** modified this, stating laughter results from our competitive nature, either from triumphing over others or witnessing their downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Descartes** called laughter the result of scorn, arising from perceiving "some small evil in a person whom we consider to be deserving of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

These philosophers agree that laughter, in this context, comes at the expense of others to make the laugher feel good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. However, showrunner Chuck Lorre described the characters as "extraordinary people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, raising the question of why they would deserve such scorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Dispossession of Nerd Culture

Instead of building up nerd culture, *The Big Bang Theory* is argued to tear it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. By paying "lip service to nerdom" and mechanically inserting references, the show reveals a "contempt for real nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The specific details of nerd culture are deemed irrelevant, as long as the characters appear as "wanky assholes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

Ultimately, this form of representation, relying on a laugh track and ridiculing its characters, does a disservice to actual nerds, from Buffy fans to Marvel fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Instead of seeing themselves reflected on screen, nerds are presented with caricatures that are consistently "dumped on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

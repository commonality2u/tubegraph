The animated series *Rick and Morty*, particularly following its Season 3 premiere, "The Rickshank Redemption", has sparked widespread discussion regarding its underlying philosophical themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Beyond the internet's fascination with Szechuan dipping sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, the show delves into profound concepts, building on previously explored [[existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty | existential themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Absurdism Defined

*Rick and Morty* frequently explores Absurdism, a philosophical school related to [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. According to French philosopher [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Albert Camus]], human existence is cruel and absurd because humans are compelled to seek meaning in a universe that remains unresponsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Camus famously uses the metaphor of Sisyphus, eternally pushing a boulder up a mountain, to illustrate this condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

In line with Camus's philosophy, *Rick and Morty* presents an absurd, meaningless multi-verse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Rick Sanchez embodies this perspective by trivializing nearly everything, including love and tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. His companionship with Morty is even framed as merely a tactic to conceal his genius from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. "The Rickshank Redemption" reinforces these themes through its portrayal of arbitrary social systems, mockery of sentimentality, and a pervasive sense of pointlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Absurdism vs. Existentialism on Meaning

Both Absurdism and [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | existentialism]] share the premise that we live in a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, the shift from the end of Season 2 to the premiere of Season 3 firmly establishes *Rick and Morty* as an "absurd" work by presenting glimpses of meaning and hope, only to shatter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### The Subversion of Meaning

At the close of Season 2, Rick momentarily steps away from his sociopathic behavior for a sincere moment at Birdperson's wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This fleeting embrace of normalcy is undercut when Tammy is revealed to be a spy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Notably, an external force, rather than Rick's inherent cynicism, thwarts his flirtation with being a caring individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Later, Rick's self-sacrifice to the Galactic Federation, seemingly driven by anguish over his family's hardships, suggested a potential embrace of "living with meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Despite his knowledge of life's meaninglessness, he appeared to choose to act rightly by his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This cliffhanger hinted at a possible shift in the show's [[existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty | existential themes]], suggesting the creation of meaning in a meaningless world, an idea championed by many existentialists but rejected by [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflecti ons_in_bojack_horseman | Camus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Camus's Critique of Existentialists

This narrative crossroads in *Rick and Morty* mirrors a disagreement Camus had with thinkers like Fyodor Dostoevsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Camus argued that authors like Dostoevsky, while depicting absurd worlds and characters aware of life's frivolity, ultimately "chicken out" by retreating to the comfort of meaning, such as religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. For Camus, Dostoevsky provided an answer to the absurd, whereas an "absurd work, on the contrary, does not provide a reply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre or Dostoevsky, despite recognizing existence's absurdity, "fail by resorting to hope, or trying to create meaning," effectively "deifying what crushes them and find reason to hope in what impoverishes them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### *Rick and Morty*'s Doubling Down on the Absurd

With the release of "The Rickshank Redemption," it became clear that *Rick and Morty* would not succumb to sentimentality or retreat into meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Instead, it "doubles down on the absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Rick's imprisonment was revealed to be a calculated ploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, and the prospect of a more humanized Rick is dismissed, promising a darker journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Much of the [[comedy_of_the_absurd_and_existentialist_themes | comedy]] in "The Rickshank Redemption" stems not from life's meaninglessness itself, but from the audience's *attempt* to derive meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. For instance, the supposed tragic origin story of Rick becoming a deranged scientist after his family's brutal murder is revealed to be a ruse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This actively baits and then mocks the audience's desire for empathy or a clear narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The show demonstrates a "perverse joy in playing with our desire to search for hope and meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Even when Rick saves Earth from the Galactic Federation, Summer's comment suggests the resulting world order is equally undesirable, negating any sense of a "greater good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The notion that Rick cares about Morty and Summer is repeatedly introduced and then dismantled; his rescue of them is ultimately explained as a means to prevent Beth from kicking him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Szechuan Sauce

The Szechuan sauce serves as the ultimate symbol of the show's embrace of the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Rick's stated motivation for his entire series arc is his quest for a forgotten promotional food item, rather than family, justice, or love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This extreme trivialization suggests that his love for the sauce means nothing in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The quest for Szechuan sauce is not about creating meaning, but rather a reflection of the absurdity of being driven by *anything* in a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. It's a joke about meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Rick as an "Absurd Hero"

Camus defines an "Absurd hero" as someone who understands and finds happiness in the pointlessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This hero must fully grasp the "cosmic indifference" surrounding them, a state Camus calls "lucid indifference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Rick Sanchez, with his vast knowledge of the multiverse where everything good and terrible can happen, and his reduction of basic morals to genetic programming, aligns with this definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. He yearns for Szechuan sauce despite being able to accomplish anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

However, a key distinction exists: Camus's absurd heroes find happiness, whereas Rick is evidently in great pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This suggests that Rick's actual character arc may not involve finding more meaning or becoming kinder, but rather learning to genuinely enjoy the absurdity of it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The true "April Fool's joke" of "The Rickshank Redemption" might be the tantalizing prospect of Rick ever finding meaning, as his self-sacrifice was ultimately a deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

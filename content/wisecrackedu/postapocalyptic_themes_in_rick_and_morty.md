The third season of *Rick and Morty* explores post-apocalyptic themes, notably in the episode "Rickmancing the Stone." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> This episode depicts Rick, Summer, and Morty traversing a setting directly inspired by *Mad Max*'s post-apocalyptic world. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

## Exploration of Alienation

In "Rickmancing the Stone," the aggressive, crumbled civilization of the post-apocalypse serves as a backdrop for the characters to confront their emotions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> Morty and Summer use this harsh environment to vent their confused feelings about their parents' divorce. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> Summer acts out and experiences her own "divorce" in this world, which helps her contextualize her parents' separation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> Morty, meanwhile, expresses his frustration through a revenge-driven arm before ultimately letting go. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

Rick introduces the idea that Summer's disillusionment with Jerry has made her seek out places where civilization has crumbled to feel alive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> The show tackles [[modern_life_and_alienation_in_rick_and_morty | alienation]] on both a micro level (family dynamics experienced by Summer and Morty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> and a macro level (societal alienation). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> Through this lens, the show illustrates how individuals lose agency in their daily lives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

## Modernity's Impact on the Wasteland

A key element in the episode is the transformation of the Wasteland after Rick introduces electricity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> The post-apocalyptic society quickly begins to resemble a modern industrialized society. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> This modernization leads to significant changes:
*   Summer's violent, active lifestyle is replaced by everyday banalities, such as grocery shopping for human bits instead of murdering mutants. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
*   The savagery of groups like the Death Stalkers devolves into mundane complaints about recycling. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   Hemorrhage, once a "murdering machine," becomes a "good-for-nothing couch potato." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>

The episode suggests that modern comforts inherently contribute to "banal, terrible lives." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a> Without external threats like mutants, people resort to bickering over trivial matters. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> The Blood Dome, once a place of violent spectacle, becomes a mere television program for people to watch due to the availability of electricity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>

Unlike most post-apocalyptic fiction that serves as a cautionary tale about how dire life might become, *Rick and Morty* posits that modern life itself is "its own special brand of soul crushing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> The show implies that comforts ultimately alienate individuals from meaning, leading to different forms of misery. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> This concept is echoed when Rick attributes the ruination of Summer's marriage to this phenomenon. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>

South Park, known for its [[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | satirical social commentary]], shifted from standalone episodes to season-long serialization in recent years, a change that was largely successful in seasons 18 and 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Season 19 notably blended themes of [[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]], advertising, and gentrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Season 20 began with an ambitious storyline encompassing the presidential election, member berries, a militant feminist Cartman, and significant [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | internet trolling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, this season ultimately "fizzled out into confusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, largely due to the unexpected outcome of the 2016 US presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## South Park's "Golden Rule" of Storytelling

The show's writing relies on a "strict order to the madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, adhere to a rigid plotline rule: if "and then" can be placed between plot beats, the story is poorly constructed due to a lack of cause and effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Good South Park-approved writing replaces "ands" with "buts" or "therefores," indicating a consequence or reaction to the previous action and ensuring every plot point matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This "golden rule" ensures the show never loses momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Election's Disruption of Season 20's Narrative

Stone and Parker openly admitted they expected Hillary Clinton (referred to as "turd sandwich") to win the election, planning Season 20's plot around that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. When Donald Trump (represented by Mr. Garrison, "giant douche") unexpectedly won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, the creators had to undertake desperate, last-minute rewrites for the episode airing the day after the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This unforeseen victory caused the show to deviate significantly from its core storytelling rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Impact on the Member Berries Plotline

Initially, the member berries storyline followed the "golden rule":
*   Randy tries member berries and falls into a nostalgic trance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy realizes member berries are dangerous brainwashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Mr. Garrison, leading in polls, realizes he has no plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Mr. Garrison tries to sabotage his campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **But** his voters demand an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy explains the truth about nostalgia's appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, they set out to destroy member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **But** they realize the berries won't die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, Randy convinces Garrison to denounce nostalgia in a speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This setup perfectly aligned with a planned Hillary victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, after Trump's win, the storyline devolved into a "big cluster f**k of and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>:
*   **And then** Mr. Garrison wins unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **And then** Caitlin Jenner reinfects Garrison and Randy with member berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **And then** they forget their quest to destroy the berries, effectively "rewinding" the plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
The member berries' purpose became muddled, transforming randomly from "intoxicating berries" to a "vomit inducing virus," and later "Nazis" or "tiny fruit militia" without logical justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Impact on the [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | Trolling]] Plotline

The [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | trolling]] subplot, centered on Kyle's dad Gerald as "skankhunt42," also initially followed the "golden rule":
*   Gerald's [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | trolling]] angers the Danes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, the Danes threaten to release everyone's internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Hillary Clinton, expecting to win, finds out Troll Trace might leak her online activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, she needs Skankhunt42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

After Hillary's loss, this narrative structure crumbled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Clinton no longer had a clear reason to recruit Gerald, yet "confusingly, Clinton recruits him anyway" for a vague mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This scene felt "disjointed" and likely recycled from the original "if Hillary had won" episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The show then resorted to random, increasingly complicated plot points to salvage the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>:
*   Clinton's claim was a ruse to help Danes kidnap American [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | trolls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **And then** the Danes were just [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | trolling]] the captured [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | trolls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **And then** the "top Danish guy" was also just a giant troll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> and not even Danish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
The narrative lost its cause-and-effect progression, leaving viewers confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The writers themselves openly complained about the "narrative hole they dug for themselves," dealing with "trolling and internet stuff over and over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### "Plot Hari-Kari": Blowing Up the Internet

To conclude the incomplete storylines, especially the risks to Cartman and Gerald from their internet history being revealed, the show committed "plot hari-kari" by blowing up the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This involved characters like Kyle's brother Ike and Pentagon generals collaborating with Elon Musk's SpaceX to take down the internet with a "massive blitz of [[trolling_and_internet_culture_in_south_park | trolling]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While destroying everyone's secrets, this also destroyed the cause-and-effect relationships built throughout the season, leading to an unsatisfying "Psych! We're blowing everything up" conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

The season initially did a good job of analyzing how the internet fragments public and private selves and enables anonymous bad behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It also satirized outrage cycles in internet culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, even briefly mentioning "Trevor's axiom" as a way to create massive online reactions, which Mr. Garrison himself recognized as how he got elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. However, these promising ideas were not fully developed due to the changed political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## The "Alternate Reality" Season 20

According to Stone and Parker, if Hillary Clinton had won, the season would have focused on Bill Clinton settling into his new role as the "terrified First Gentleman of the U.S." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Viewers got a glimpse of this in the post-election episode, where Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby formed a "gentlemen's club" for men to hide from women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This storyline would have escalated the ongoing "battle of the sexes" at South Park Elementary, lending more poignancy to Cartman's fear of his girlfriend Heidi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Instead, the First Gentleman's club plotline was abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Future of South Park's Serialization

The creators hinted at "the end of serialization as we know it" for South Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. While Season 20 was messy, the preceding serialized seasons (18 and 19) were considered some of their best work in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The unexpected election outcome significantly impacted the show's narrative integrity and its adherence to its established storytelling rules.

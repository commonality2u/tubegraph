South Park often handles religion with [[role_of_irreverence_in_south_parks_narrative | irreverence]], ensuring that "nothing is sacred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While the show is known for its general irreverence, it possesses a unique approach to religion, which is typically associated with reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The series challenges viewers to consider the true meaning of religion, raising questions other shows might avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## When Religion Matters: Manipulation

In the world of South Park, profound concepts can be treated as mundane, while ordinary things are given significant importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For instance, the boys are not starstruck when meeting Jesus, but argue over who plays him in an Easter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Similarly, when the boys meet God in season three, Stan's burning question is about periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Even Jesus struggles to get viewers for his public-access talk show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

However, the show highlights a specific scenario where religion *does* stand out as important: when it is manipulated for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Eric Cartman: Master Manipulator

While various town leaders attempt to manipulate religion, Eric Cartman is consistently depicted as the undisputed master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Cartman famously declares, "I know enough to exploit it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

His methods of religious manipulation include:
*   Becoming a tent revival preacher in season four to get rich from donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Making a name for himself in Christian music during season seven by transforming secular pop songs into seemingly religious ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Building a fan club around Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* in season eight's “The Passion of the Jew,” viewing it as an opportunity to lead the Fourth Reich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Painting a cow to resemble the biblically prophesied red heifer in season 17, solely to mess with Kyle's mind, which unintentionally results in world peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## South Park's Stance on Religion

While it might seem that South Park's message is that religion is inherently ridiculous and makes people gullible, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker largely disagree with this impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Matt Stone noted that while atheists appreciate how the show satirizes religion, neither he nor Parker are anti-religious; he personally finds religion fascinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The show's perceived anti-religious stance stems from its refusal to treat religion as a sacred subject, which contrasts with Western spiritual traditions that emphasize honoring the sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. French philosopher Émile Durkheim theorized that Western religions divide the world into the sacred and the profane, with the sacred always taken seriously due to its cosmic implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. [[comparison_of_sacred_and_profane_in_south_park | South Park fundamentally denies the legitimacy of this distinction]] between the sacred and the profane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

In season six's “Red Hot Catholic Love,” Father Maxie's journey to the Vatican reveals the Catholic Church is an intergalactic coalition led by a sentient giant spider that green-lit pedophilia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Maxie bravely tears a "sacred Vatican Document," defying the Queen Spider's authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This acts as a metaphor for the molestation scandal, implying that if the church remained too sacred to investigate, it could not evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The show suggests that salvation for something held sacred sometimes requires its desecration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Critiquing Self-Righteousness Beyond Religion

Beyond its specific take on religion, South Park asserts that self-righteousness and narrow-mindedness are not exclusive to religious people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The series often features characters who are self-righteous about various causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. For example, Stan's season sixteen arc as a self-promotional activist highlights his desire for reverence, only to abandon causes when they no longer make him popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This contrasts with Wendy Testaburger, whose motivations are deeper and less driven by popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

South Park suggests that movements driven by individuals seeking to be taken seriously are prone to derailment, a critique applied even to the New Atheism movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. In the "Go God Go" two-part episode, Cartman is trapped in the 26th century where three militant atheist factions are killing each other over branding disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This episode's message is clear: human beings are inherently violent and irrational, and removing religion won't change that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Matt Stone and Trey Parker believe that religion appears ridiculous because people are ridiculous, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. They echo science historian Margaret Wertheim, who argues that Western scientific models often resemble religious ones due to a "hypermasculine drive for certainty and finality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This refusal to accept ambiguity can make answers to fundamental questions seem absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

Ultimately, South Park doesn't tell viewers whether to be religious or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Matt Stone posed the rhetorical question in 2011: "if the mass delusion of a religion makes you happy, makes your family work better, is that bad or good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The show implicitly argues that embracing a religion or ideology can be sensible, and not doing so can also be sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

South Park's unique philosophy suggests that being human is inevitably ridiculous, and there's no way to avoid this fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The show advises that regardless of one's chosen belief system or life philosophy, taking oneself too seriously will ultimately appear silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The true question is not whether one's belief system is a joke, but whether one is aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

*Grand Theft Auto V* extensively utilizes [[parody_of_disaster_films_and_media_sensationalism | parody]] and social commentary to satirize the California lifestyle and the pervasive influence of media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The game's setting, Los Santos, is presented as an askew representation of reality, similar to the worlds found in Mel Brooks movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Parody as a Satirical Tool
[[Parody_of_disaster_films_and_media_sensationalism | Parody]] is defined as a form of high burlesque that imitates a specific literary work or style for comic effect, usually to ridicule or criticize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. It is often employed to make a satirical or even political point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

In *Grand Theft Auto V*, this is evident through:
*   **Brand and Company Satire** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>:
    *   Android phones become "badger phones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   Apple is replaced by "iFruit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   Fox News is "weasel news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   *American Idol* is "Fame or Shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   Prominent tech figures like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs are combined into the character Jay Norris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Google Maps is "eyefind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   Facebook is "Lifeinvader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Michael De Santa: The Californian Archetype
Michael De Santa, a retired bank robber in witness protection, serves as a character through whom the clich√©d California lifestyle is explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This lifestyle is characterized by obsessions with the economy, capitalism, personal fitness, paparazzi, celebrity culture, and various forms of media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Michael frequently watches TV and is enamored with old movies, parodying the stereotypical Los Angeleano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. His family life further highlights this critique:
*   His wife is "enamored" with her tennis coach and yoga instructor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   His son struggles with identity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   His psychologist is depicted as inept, cynical, and greedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   His daughter associates with adult film actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

Michael's problems are presented as "Hollywood problems," even his criticisms of capitalism are distinctly Californian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Despite railing against capitalism, Michael lives a life of luxury, owning a yacht, a fancy house, customized cars, multiple televisions, a tennis court, a pool, and a collection of "snazzy cargo shorts with sandals ensembles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. His complaints about consumption are portrayed as superficial, mirroring those of many in Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Michael's storyline ultimately critiques the feeling of emptiness inherent in the shallow, upper-class California lifestyle, a world built on appearance, plastic surgery, self-help, leisure, and misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Parody of California Locations
The game world itself is a "tongue and cheek" play on real California locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>:
*   Vespucci Beach mimics Venice Beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Vinewood is Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Del Perro Pier is the Santa Monica Pier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   The Watts Towers are renamed the Jefferson Towers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   Compton is reimagined as Davis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Long Beach becomes Cypress Flats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   The Pacific Palisades are renamed the Pacific Bluffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   Bel Air becomes Richman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   The Salton Sea is renamed the Alamo Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   The sandy shores desert area of GTA is a stand-in for the Coachella Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

The game's extensive effort to create verisimilitude in its enormous environment is commendable, yet at times, it becomes "a little too real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This is exemplified by Lindsay Lohan's lawsuit against Rockstar, alleging the use of her likeness for the character Lacey Jonas, a former child star constantly mobbed by paparazzi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Media Satire
[[Satire_social_commentary_and_parody_in_grand_theft_auto_v | Grand Theft Auto V]] offers an "all out criticism" of our media-driven world, targeting radio, television, film, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Some of the most "stinging criticisms" are delivered through the game's talk radio stations heard while driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The game and tech industries are also lampooned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>:
*   Jimmy plays a bizarre game involving slaughtering pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   Michael infiltrates the Lifeinvader campus, where coders struggle with "not safe for work pop ups" and basic antivirus software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   Lester is depicted as constantly shouting while playing first-person shooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Ultimately, *Grand Theft Auto V* is presented as a "masterful criticism of American culture," using its depictions of sex, violence, and debauchery as a mirror to show America its true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

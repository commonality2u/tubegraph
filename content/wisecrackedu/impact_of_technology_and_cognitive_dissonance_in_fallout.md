The *Fallout* series takes place in an alternate 23rd-century reality where 1950s culture persisted and a prevalent Cold War mentality led to a global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This conflict culminated in 2077 with nuclear powers launching arsenals at each other, plunging the world into a new dark age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The game's setting offers a rich ground for philosophical analysis, particularly regarding how societal culture, propaganda, and technological advancements can lead to catastrophic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Technology's Divergent Path

In *Fallout*'s alternate reality, fascination with atomic power proliferated in the mid-20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This trajectory was never offset by the invention of the transistor, which in our reality led to compact electronics like radios, computers, and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. As a result, *Fallout*'s pre-war society is technologically advanced but in a distinct way: technology is often large, bulky, and computers are primitive compared to modern standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Despite this, the society developed advanced power armor and laser guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The post-apocalyptic "Wasteland" is filled with remnants of the pre-war world's sheer optimism, reflecting an age of atomic energy where grand dreams were pursued, often alongside "giant anti-communist death robots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

> [00:01:54] "Death is preferable alternative to communism."

## Cognitive Dissonance and Societal Control

The pre-war optimism is starkly evident in the [[Philosophical Critiques of Society and Government in Fallout | Vaults]], which despite being designed as shelters from imminent nuclear annihilation, maintained a cheerful appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Many of these Vaults were actually covers for government-orchestrated experiments on their residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The Vaults serve as a powerful testament to the human capacity for [[Concept of Doublethink | cognitive dissonance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The prospect of being confined indefinitely in an underground bunker was advertised as an exciting adventure, complete with opportunities for making new friends and raising a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This echoes the real-life luxury bomb shelters of the Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse analyzed these "mental gymnastics" during the Cold War, arguing that pleasant appearances covering up modern nightmares demonstrate society's ability to suppress criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He contended that capitalism's marketing prowess made even the most dreadful situations seem "dandy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Marcuse cited real "deluxe fallout shelters"—equipped with televisions, lounge chairs, and Scrabble boards—as the ultimate example of the "obscene merger" between a luxurious appearance and a fundamentally awful reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

> [00:02:51] "You know how bad sunburn can feel. The atomic bomb blast could burn you worse than a terrible sunburn."

### Disparity and Dark Humor

This disparity between appearance and reality fuels much of *Fallout*'s humor, constantly juxtaposing a quaint, 1950s "Leave-it-to-Beaver-esque" culture with the hellscape of the Wasteland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This is observed in the Vaults and the game's radio stations, which play cheerful jazz tunes over the player's battles against irradiated human remnants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The prominent use of "I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire" in the game's trailer plays on the song's innocent romanticism against the backdrop of a literally incinerated Washington D.C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Similarly, Cole Porter’s "Anything Goes," an upbeat song about lax morals, serves as a nod to the absolute anarchy of the Wasteland, where cannibalism is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

These unions of positive and negative, happy and sad, are more than comedic; they represent how society celebrates the very culture and [[Technology and societal disconnect | technology]] that perpetually brings it to the brink of annihilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This [[Ironic distance and cynicism in contemporary culture | ironic play of elements]] also functions as a criticism of government propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### One-Dimensional Thought

Marcuse argued that society is in an age of "one-dimensional thought," where the merging of positive and negative means rationality and technology can only move "forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This implies that [[Technology and societal disconnect | technology]] is always presented as good, leaving no room for "negative thought" or ideas that question society's inane positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

> [00:05:06] "Democracy is truth. Communism is a lie."

This concept is vividly illustrated at the beginning of *Fallout 3*, where the player is forced to have fun at their own birthday party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. One way to ensure societal acceptance of a "twisted reality" is to make people "too happy to care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## The Enclave and Distracted Society

The Enclave, the remnants of the United States government, seeks to purge the Wasteland of its inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Their president, John Henry Eden, is revealed to be a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Eden understands the importance of fun and leisure in maintaining an obedient society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. In his radio addresses, he praises baseball as a savior of the American dream, aiming to revive the pre-war society's comforts and recreation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

> [00:06:07] "I am referring, of course, to our great national pastime: baseball. That's right, America. Before we were devastated by atomic war, each state had its own professional baseball team. Their purpose: to make you, dear America, revel in the joys of sport and sunshine. Put your faith in John Henry Eden, great America, and baseball will live again."

The Wasteland is filled with reminders of pre-war excess, such as leisure suits, magazines, and televisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. These comforts offer an easy way to cope with horrific realities, leading to a distracted society that Eden tries to resurrect—the same type of society that led to the apocalypse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This society, he believes, would not mind his genocidal plans because they are too distracted to care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Technology as a Double-Edged Sword

From the Great War that decimated the world to secret government experiments that created Super Mutants, *Fallout* constantly reminds players of [[Technology and societal disconnect | technology]] gone awry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. In *Fallout*, as in real life, technology is portrayed as a double-edged sword, capable of both good and bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Players are frequently presented with [[Moral Dilemmas and Security Logic in Apocalyptic Worlds | moral dilemmas]] concerning technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>:
*   Should technology provide clean water to the Wasteland or unleash a devastating virus for "purification?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>
*   Who should control Mr. House’s robotic army in New Vegas? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>

The game draws inspiration from the Greek myth of Phaethon, who disastrously took his father Helios's sun chariot for a ride, burning portions of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. In *Fallout: New Vegas*, the giant solar plant capable of harnessing the sun’s energy is named Helios One, allowing the player to similarly unleash destructive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Two main responses to this technological dilemma are presented:
1.  **The Brotherhood of Steel:** This secretive order hoards advanced technology in heavily armored bases, believing no one else can be trusted with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. They will go to war with any [[Factions and Politics in Fallout | faction]] possessing advanced tech, despite the implication that they might not be trustworthy themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
2.  **Caesar's Legion:** This [[Factions and Politics in Fallout | faction]] swears off technology, except for tools that enhance killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Caesar believes technology makes people weak and dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. However, even without advanced tech, Caesar's totalitarian state commits extensive wrongdoing, suggesting technology is not solely to blame for human depravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Conclusion

The core message embedded in *Fallout*'s design and narrative, often encapsulated by the phrase "War never changes," could also be interpreted as "humanity never changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Beyond mutated creatures, the most terrifying aspect of the Wasteland is its re-enactment of humanity's regrettable history: slavery-obsessed Romans, [[Concept of Doublethink | Orwellian]] dictatorships, and genocidal governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The game suggests that history, indeed, repeats itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

The *Bioshock* trilogy is noted for its effective integration of philosophical concepts into its plot, alongside its innovative gameplay mixing elements of survival horror, RPGs, and FPS games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The series demonstrates a level of intellectual sophistication rarely seen in games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Philosophical Themes in *Bioshock* (Original)

The original *Bioshock* game explores themes heavily influenced by the work of Russian-born thinker Ayn Rand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The game's setting, Rapture, is a "digital homage" to "Galt's Gulch," a hidden community from Rand's novel *Atlas Shrugged* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The protagonist of *Atlas Shrugged*, John Galt, encourages a strike of the mind, where industrialists withdraw from an increasingly regulated world, frustrated with socialism's inefficiency and lack of care for the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Ayn Rand's Objectivism]]

Rapture's founder, Andrew Ryan, is an anagram for "Ayn Rand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Ryan's political philosophy is directly taken from Rand's concept of [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Objectivism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Tenets of Objectivism**
> [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Objectivism]] is a guide to living a worthy life, with its main tenets being:
> *   **Reality**: Concrete and objective, rejecting mystical or divine guiding forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Actions should be based solely on intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Ayn Rand is considered an atheist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
> *   **Reason** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
> *   **Self-interest**: People should work hard to achieve happiness in their own lives and not treat others as mere means to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
> *   **Capitalism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

Andrew Ryan serves as a mouthpiece for Rand's condemnation of coercive governments, advocating for a society where government policies do not violate people's autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. His monologues often mirror Rand's work, emphasizing self-interest and individual intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> Ryan: "I believe in no God – no invisible man in the sky. But there is something more powerful than each of us: a combination of our efforts, a Great Chain of industry that unites us."
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> Ryan: "Though my physical defenses fall, you'll not defeat me. My strength is not in steel and fire, but in my intellect and will... In the end, all that matters to me is me. And all that matters to you is you. It is the nature of things."

Rapture was founded on the belief that "communist parasites" in the world above were "freeloaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, mirroring Galt's frustration with not receiving deserved rewards for his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Ryan explicitly rejects collectivist notions of ownership:

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> Ryan: "“No,” says the man in Washington, “It belongs to the poor.” “No,” says the man in the Vatican, “It belongs to God.” “No,” says the man in Moscow, “It belongs to everyone.” I rejected those answers."

### [[the_role_of_free_market_and_deregulation_in_bioshocks_narrative | Free Market and Deregulation]]

Both Rand and Ryan were proponents of Laissez-faire capitalism, where government's role is limited to protecting individual rights and staying out of personal lives and the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In Rapture, the plasmid market was severely unregulated, based on the belief that an unfettered market provides the best options for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> Ryan (tape): "There has been tremendous pressure to regulate this plasmid business. There have been side effects: blindness, insanity, death. But what use is our ideology if it is not tested? The market does not respond like an infant, shrieking at the first sign of displeasure. The market is patient, and we must be too."

### The Ruin of Rapture

The ruinous state of Rapture suggests a critique of a society run by these tenets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The resource ADAM, essential for plasmids, was completely deregulated due to Ryan's free market ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This led to a civil war and a population of addicts, resulting in rampant chaos and instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The use of Little Sisters to produce ADAM, treating them as mere tools, would certainly be disapproved by Ayn Rand's [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Objectivism]], which dictates not treating others as means to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Philosophical Themes in *Bioshock Infinite*

The third installment, *Bioshock Infinite*, moves from the underwater city of Rapture to the floating city of Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Columbia, a play on the United States Capital, is a floating Eden founded by Zachary Hale Comstock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Comstock, a fictional stand-in for 19th-century New York political figure Anthony Comstock, founds Columbia as a place for "God's people" away from the "sinners below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### [[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]]

Columbia's image as a "shining beacon in the sky" is philosophically justified by the concept of [[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This belief holds that the New World was promised to "God's chosen people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. *Bioshock Infinite* provides a satire of America's historical landscape through this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

[[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]] justifies a particular lifestyle and presented America as "God's country," with themes of forgiveness, salvation, and baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. However, like its predecessor, *Infinite* explores the dark side of this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

The expansion into the new frontier was justified as a mission from God to prevent the new world from backsliding like "old world sinners of Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. America was seen as a land for "exceptional, chosen people, exempt, and above the rest of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Secularized as Manifest Destiny, [[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]] justified the extermination of indigenous people ("Native Americans") to secure the national identity of Christian settlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Those unwilling to accept Christianity were forcibly moved or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The ideology of [[american_exceptionalism_and_its_critique_in_bioshock_infinite | American Exceptionalism]] is interwoven into the fabric of history, justifying slavery, labor strikes, and the abuse of Irish and Chinese workers who built the American railroad system, all for the "lofty goal of a promised city for God's people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Columbia is depicted as a paranoid place, fearful of the anarchist Vox Populi, and scared of Irish and Chinese threats and racial mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. *Infinite* explores America's haunted past, referencing events like the Battle of Wounded Knee, which is heralded as the end of the U.S. and Indian wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Racial segregation laws and lynching are common in Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, exemplified by enemies like robotic George Washingtons called "Patriots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## [[the_illusion_of_free_will_and_player_choice_in_bioshock | The Illusion of Free Will and Player Choice]]

One of the essential dilemmas explored across the *Bioshock* series is the concept of freedom of action, choice, and [[the_illusion_of_free_will_and_player_choice_in_bioshock | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

In the first *Bioshock*, the phrase "Andrew Ryan reminds us – we all make choices, but, in the end, our choices make us" is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This paradox leads to the question of whether [[the_illusion_of_free_will_and_player_choice_in_bioshock | free will]] is truly possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Hard Determinism

One school of thought, Hard Determinism, suggests that [[the_illusion_of_free_will_and_player_choice_in_bioshock | free will]] does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. If all actions are a result of cause and effect, then all actions are bound by external forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This perspective argues that "choice" in actions is merely an illusion, as they are a result of a series of events beyond one's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

Andrew Ryan famously reiterates this with the phrase "A man chooses. A slave obeys." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. In the original *Bioshock*, Ryan makes a statement on the nature of gaming itself, suggesting that the player is destined to mindlessly follow the game's fixed narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The idea of "interactivity" or the gamer having any bearing on the game's outcome is presented as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Determinism in *Bioshock Infinite*

*Bioshock Infinite* introduces the concept of the multiverse as a potential way out of the problem of [[the_illusion_of_free_will_and_player_choice_in_bioshock | free will]], suggesting an infinite number of worlds to choose from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. For example, Booker's ability to go back and choose not to be baptized or to "smother baby Comstock in his crib" appears to offer an escape from a deterministic universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

However, the game ultimately demonstrates that even these choices are not real possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. *Infinite* subtly hints at the problem of [[the_illusion_of_free_will_and_player_choice_in_bioshock | free will]] through forced player actions:
*   **The Coin Flip**: The player is prompted to press X to flip a coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. The game will not progress if the player does not press X, effectively removing the choice not to flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Furthermore, the coin always lands on heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Handing Over Elizabeth**: Booker is prompted with the choice to "Bring [them] the girl and wipe away the debt," and the game presents the option to press X to hand Elizabeth over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. However, the only way to progress is to press Square and pick up baby Elizabeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Even though "Press X" is an apparent option, this choice is an illusion, and the player is fated to hand Elizabeth over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

By making the player actively perform these seemingly "chosen" actions rather than showing them in a cutscene, *Bioshock* forces the player to recognize that they are not truly free and that any indication otherwise is an illusion <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The game suggests that perhaps the only way to truly assert one's freedom in the world of *Bioshock* is to simply turn off the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

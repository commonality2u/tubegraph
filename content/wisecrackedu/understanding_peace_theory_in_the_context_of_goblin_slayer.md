*Goblin Slayer* is a fantasy series that raises a central question: Why does [[analysis_of_goblin_slayers_focus_on_goblin_killing | Goblin Slayer only kill goblins]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> This focus forms a greater message for the show and offers an interesting development for the fantasy genre. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

The series follows a bright-eyed priestess who, after her friends are killed by goblins on their first adventure, is rescued by Goblin Slayer and joins his party. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> Their group expands to include an elf, dwarf, and lizard man as they continue to investigate and eliminate goblins. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>

## Subversion of Fantasy Tropes

The show heavily references Dungeons & Dragons, featuring elements like dice rolling, spell slots, guilds, quests, and various other fantasy tropes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> *Goblin Slayer* embraces the generic aspects of the fantasy genre, with characters and locations having intentionally generic names such as "Elven Ranger," "Watertown," or "Sword Maiden," and even major antagonists like "Goblin Champion" or "Demon Lord." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

In typical fantasy narratives, heroes begin by tackling [[impact_of_small_threats_in_fantasy_narratives | small stuff like rats, bugs, and goblins]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> They progress through these minor challenges until they are powerful enough to confront stronger enemies, often culminating in a horrifying villain threatening the world. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> This structure suggests that once the "big bad" is defeated, things return to normal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>

*Goblin Slayer* [[subversion_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | subverts the basic assumptions of the fantasy genre]], particularly the notion of a "happily ever after," by having Goblin Slayer refuse to follow this linear path. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> He explicitly states he would "rather just kill goblins." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> His reasoning is that even if a Demon Lord is defeated, goblins will continue to terrorize rural and vulnerable areas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> This emphasis on persistent, smaller threats highlights that peace isn't automatically achieved once a major conflict ends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

This point is underscored when the Demon Lord is dispatched in under a minute by unrelated heroes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> Rather than leading to a "happily ever after," this event reminds the audience that smaller, less spectacular monsters still plague villagers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

## Peace Theory and Goblin Slayer's Logic

Goblin Slayer's approach can be understood through the lens of peace theory, which asks what exactly constitutes peace. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> Theorist John Galtung distinguishes between two types of peace:

### Negative Peace
Negative peace is defined as the absence of war or large-scale conflict. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> In the context of the fantasy genre, this means a world without major antagonists like Night Kings, Sauron, or Ganondorf—or in *Goblin Slayer*'s case, Demon Lords destroying the world. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> While this is a common understanding of peace, it doesn't account for the smaller, often more pervasive violence affecting society's most vulnerable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>

### Positive Peace
Positive peace is the presence of justice and protections that serve the needs of everyone. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> This is the kind of peace Goblin Slayer pursues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> In the show, this specifically refers to goblins, but in the real world, it can represent persistent issues like poverty, famine, disease, corruption, discrimination, or crime—the "goblins of the real world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>

For many, violence is an interruption, but for some, it is the constant backdrop of daily life. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> Goblin Slayer cannot simply relax at an idyllic farm without constantly watching for goblins and reinforcing defenses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> From his perspective, the nature of the world ensures that people in rural areas will always face goblin attacks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> He focuses on burning down goblin nests, prioritizing short-term conflict prevention and long-term protection over grand, world-saving deeds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>

## The Problem of "Grunt Work"

Small issues can accumulate to create an equally difficult reality for many. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> The kind of "small work" required to address these issues is often dismissed as "grunt work," lacking the glory of defeating a Demon Lord. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> Even after the Demon Lord's demise, the cleanup of his armies is considered beneath some heroes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>

Despite being a silver-class adventurer, Goblin Slayer is mocked for his choice of missions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> In the [[critique_of_heroism_and_societal_roles_in_goblin_slayer | hierarchy of adventuring]], he is compared to a general cleaning latrines. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a> The show suggests that if no one is willing to do the "janitorial" work, society suffers from the overlooked, pervasive problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>

This phenomenon is observable in real life:
*   Doctors researching cancer receive press, while those preventing equally deadly illnesses through routine water testing do not. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
*   People pursue high-paying, high-prestige jobs without considering their social impact. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   In sports, everyone wants to be the quarterback, but few aspire to be a left tackle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>

Goblin Slayer initially wanted to kill dragons, but after experiencing the dangers of goblins firsthand, he dedicated himself to his current mission. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>

## Consequences of Neglecting Goblins

The stigma against goblin slaying leads to two significant issues:

1.  **Minimization of Threat**: The stigma causes many to underestimate the danger goblins pose. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> While fighting goblins may seem simple (mostly swinging swords), they employ tricks that make them very dangerous. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> Because goblins are perceived as an easy problem, unqualified individuals are sent to deal with them, as silver-ranked heroes believe they have "better things to do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> This results in unqualified heroes being killed and goblins continuing to thrive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>

2.  **Worsening Problem**: The goblin problem escalates as they breed and become more dangerous. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> Major heroes avoid involvement, viewing goblins as mere pests or being too embarrassed to admit they are a real threat after having defeated greater evils. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>

The Sword Maiden, a powerful leader who once slayed the original Demon Lord, demonstrates this fear. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> She hires Goblin Slayer to deal with goblins under the city, but it becomes clear she orchestrated murders to compel someone else to handle the threat because she was afraid of goblins after her own traumatic encounter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> Admitting such a fear after defeating a Demon Lord goes against the "unspoken hero code." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>

## Psychological Impact and Narrative Implications

Goblin attacks leave people in a constant state of fear and anxiety, contributing to an already difficult life. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> This raises the stakes of positive peace, as dealing with goblins significantly impacts the psychological well-being of victims. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a> Goblin Slayer's intervention, including his direct actions and his conversation with the Sword Maiden about her fears, substantially improves her condition, as she no longer suffers from goblin nightmares. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>

This unique take on fantasy raises questions about the narrative trajectory. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> Normally, threats in a series escalate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> However, since the Demon Lord has already been vanquished and Goblin Slayer remains committed to only slaying goblins, the series must find creative ways to raise the stakes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a> This could involve increasing ambiguity around the goblin threat or bringing the problem closer to home for Goblin Slayer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>

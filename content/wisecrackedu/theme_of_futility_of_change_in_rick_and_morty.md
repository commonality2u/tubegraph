*Rick and Morty*, created by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, stands out for its mastery of story structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While the show explores many [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | philosophical themes]], its unique approach to narrative structure, particularly the concept of change, is central to its distinct identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Dan Harmon's Story Circle and Television's Goal

Dan Harmon posits that every story adheres to an "8 simple steps" structure, known as "the story embryo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>:
1.  A character is in a zone of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  But they want something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  They enter an unfamiliar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  Adapt to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
5.  Get what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
6.  Pay a heavy price for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
7.  Then return to their familiar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
8.  Having changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

However, this structure differs for television compared to movies. While a movie aims to send viewers out on a "90 minute high," television seeks to keep people watching "forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Harmon suggests this is partly to put the audience's brain in a "vegetative state" for commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This means that television shows are "less about change, and more about preserving the status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Harmon notes that TV "swaps out any meaningful and therefore potentially television-subverting truth with the basic, eternal 'truth' that change is unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The adjusted 8-step structure for a TV episode reflects this:
1.  "I (the protagonist)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
2.  "Notice a small problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
3.  "And make a major decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
4.  "This changes things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
5.  "To some satisfaction, but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
6.  "There are consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
7.  "That must be undone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
8.  "And I must admit the futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon rigorously follow this advice, with "every episode of *Rick and Morty*" adhering to this format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## The Futility of Change in "The Ricks Must Be Crazy"

This theme is exemplified in Season 2, Episode 6, "The Ricks Must Be Crazy."
*   **Adaptation (Step 4):** While traditional stories show internal change, TV emphasizes "external change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. When confronted with Zeep Xanflorp, a scientist who mirrors Rick's own disregard for sentient life, Rick does not change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Instead, Rick "shamelessly parrots the same objections Morty had made earlier to him," demonstrating his lack of internal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **The Price (Step 6):** Rick achieves his goal of creating a Microverse within Zeep's, but at a "hefty price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. His actions cause Kyle, the scientist in Zeep's Microverse, to have an [[the_concept_of_meaninglessness_in_rick_and_mortys_universe | existential meltdown]] and commit suicide, trapping Rick and Zeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Rick and Zeep, unable to overcome their egos, refuse to cooperate, highlighting their unchanging, self-destructive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Return (Step 7):** Zeep acts as Rick's "shadow," a "dark reflection of all Rick’s undesirable traits and neuroses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Unlike traditional heroes who overcome their shadow to transform, Rick, who is "completely aware of all his shortcomings and has no desire to fix them," battles Zeep as if "it’s just Rick fighting Rick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Morty even feels the fight is "unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Futility of Change (Step 8):** This final step for TV is not about fulfillment but about admitting the "futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. In *Rick and Morty*, the hero can never be fulfilled to ensure future adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Rick resolves the battery issue by effectively re-enslaving an entire planet to power his car, all for "some ice-cream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. The episode concludes with a dazed Morty and Summer shell-shocked by the return to normalcy, illustrating how little has fundamentally changed despite their perilous journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

While *Rick and Morty* frequently mocks popular culture and [[inversion_of_common_cliches_and_tropes_in_rick_and_morty | inverts common tropes]], its core structure remains consistent with television norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. However, it leverages this circular structure not to provide comfort, but to force the audience to "confront the depressing, crippling futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Though Rick Sanchez may not believe in much, the creative team behind *Rick and Morty* clearly believes in the power of this specific story structure to convey its core message of stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

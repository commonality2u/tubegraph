From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*House of Cards*, the American version, delves into the dark and scandalous world of politics, chronicling Frank and Claire Underwood’s ruthless quest for power and the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The show's popularity can be linked to increasing cynicism about the current state of American politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Unlike many American political dramas that offer morally righteous characters and eventual redemption, *House of Cards* rejects this narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Instead, it presents a process where raw power and cunning consistently win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The series is not merely a tale of evil triumphing over good, but rather asks: "Is there more to politics than pure [[politics_as_spectacle_in_house_of_cards | spectacle]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

## Aesthetics, Theater, and the Political Philosophy

In the cynical world of *House of Cards*, characters constantly maintain an image, both publicly and privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The show's creators are notably obsessed with [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]]—art and beauty—within the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Important dealings often occur while reflecting on art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, and Claire's appearance is meticulously manicured, with her wardrobe frequently discussed within the show and in real-life fashion listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. However, beneath these "pretty [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]] and art references," the show suggests there is "Well... nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The preoccupation with [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]] also extends to the show's frequent tribute to [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | theater]], particularly William Shakespeare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Frank Underwood often employs soliloquies and asides, theatrical devices heavily used by Shakespeare to explicate a character's inner thoughts to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Much of the show’s plot and characters evoke Shakespearean classics like *Macbeth* and *Richard III*, inspiring Frank's charming asides about his terrible behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Even Petrov, during his White House visit, quotes Gorbachev, who in turn quotes Richard III's famous opening line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

[[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | Theater]], [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]], and art collectively point to a more fundamental concept within [[the_political_philosophy_in_house_of_cards | House of Cards]]: that appearance drives [[the_political_philosophy_in_house_of_cards | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. [[politics_as_spectacle_in_house_of_cards | Politics is theater]], or at least its own form of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Frank, for example, visits his father to "seem more human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. His breaking of the fourth wall blurs the distinction between the show and reality, highlighting the theatrical nature of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Politics as Performance

Contemporary commentators lament the transformation of politics into entertainment, where slogans replace genuine argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This phenomenon is evident in the show:
*   Frank destroys Michael Kern's career over an op-ed he didn't write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   Kern self-destructs when he cannot keep pace with media sensationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   A brick through Frank's window, which he fabricated, serves as a symbol against out-of-control teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

German philosopher Hannah Arendt argues that "the realm of appearances is the realm of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For Arendt, attempting to strip away appearances to find a "core" is futile because appearances *are* the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This idea originates in the ancient Greek Polis, where politics meant speaking and being heard in the Agora; citizens' political lives were identical to how they appeared to others, much like an actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Arendt states that for humans, "appearance—something that can be seen or heard by others as well as ourselves, constitutes reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Frank Underwood understands this concept, stating: "We are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. His interactions with Claire, Zoe, Meechum, and Freddy show different facets of his character, leading to the interpretation that he is a sociopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. His chosen revelations are carefully crafted manipulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### The Illusion of Authenticity

The idea that appearances are deceptive and unreliable is ancient, dating back to Plato's allegory of the cave, where one must disillusion oneself of misleading shadows to discover "true" reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Karl Marx's "Theory of Ideology" and even *The Matrix* rehash this Platonic distinction between appearance and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Modern commentators who complain that political media is a "grotesque [[politics_as_spectacle_in_house_of_cards | spectacle]]" concealing "what really goes on behind closed doors" are modern torch-bearers of this millennia-old argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

However, Frank and Arendt undermine the central tenet of this tradition: that an authentic reality lies behind the world of appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. For both Frank and Arendt, appearance *is* reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. If viewers struggle to hate Frank Underwood, it's because there is no stable identity to hate; he is a different person to different people, a "two-timing liar to... well everybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Remy and Jackie's relationship further illustrates this problem, as they are "unable to reconcile their professional lives with their authentic selves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Through its intermingling of art, [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | theater]], and [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]], the show challenges old ideas about how reality operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The argument is not that Frank Underwood or lying politicians are good, but that "appearances and reality aren’t as easy to disentangle as we might think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Hypocrisy and the Search for Motives

Frank is the epitome of a hypocrite, openly admitting he is one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. A hypocrite acts inconsistently with stated beliefs and puts on "false appearances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The term originates from the Ancient Greek word for "playacting," reinforcing the idea that the [[the_political_philosophy_in_house_of_cards | politics]] of *House of Cards* is mere [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | theater]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

While history often condemns hypocrites, the "hunt for the Frank Underwoods of the world is impossible behind of the aesthetic nature of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Arendt argues that "The search for motives, the demand that everybody displays [their] innermost motivation... transforms all actors into hypocrites and 'hypocrisy' begins to poison all human relations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. For Arendt, the solution is to realize "we have no ability to distinguish between 'being and appearance'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Frank himself may not know his true, unwavering convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. When one tries to strip away the façade of appearances, they reveal not a "real person," but "just more mystery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Claire's Authenticity

Claire's portrayal suggests that, unlike Frank, there *is* something behind her mask that she must suppress to continue her quest for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. After Zoe Barnes dies, Claire immediately applies makeup, as if "[[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | aesthetics]] suppresses her true feelings of disgust about Frank's deeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. While Frank remains elusive in his true self, Claire's affinity for art, like photography and origami, indicates "a yearning for authentic self expression—to stop performing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Her attraction to the photographer suggests she is "seduced by his genuine bohemian lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Leaving a Legacy: Ephemeral vs. Enduring Appearance

Frank Underwood is driven by a simple desire for power, which he frequently reiterates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Power, for Frank, is the foundation of a larger dream: to build a [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. His quest for power can be likened to a quest to build a work of art in the form of his [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

This is sharply contrasted by the Buddhist monks' sand painting (mandala) in Season 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The practice involves meticulously creating elaborate designs and then destroying them, signifying the fleeting nature of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Frank is deeply annoyed by this practice, as sand mandalas stand in stark contrast to the Western artistic tradition's aim for enduring, often gigantic, art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. It's unsurprising that Frank, who seeks immortality through his quest for power, hates the mandala, declaring: "Money... is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years. Power... is the old stone building that stands for centuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Frank's civil war diorama serves as a counterpoint: it memorializes his ancestors but is eventually destroyed by him, symbolizing that even his presidency is fleeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Claire, unlike Frank, does not detest the sand mandala, and its destruction foreshadows her departure from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Like the mandala, Claire acknowledges that nothing, "not even her marriage, is permanent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. She leaves her political life behind despite long toil, just as the monks destroy their painstakingly created art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Claire also struggles with [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]], but differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While supporting Frank's ambitions, she has discarded her own, neglecting CWI and shunting her desire for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. When a homeless person rejects her money (a symbol of the Underwoods' power) and folds it into origami, Claire is confronted with her choice: "power and wealth over creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. She takes up origami, symbolizing her desire to create a [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]] through family rather than power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

The show's title, *House of Cards*, raises the question of whether Frank builds a lasting [[the_concept_of_legacy_in_house_of_cards | legacy]] or a structure on the verge of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Frank explicitly strives for immortality, a concept familiar in Ancient Greek politics where individuals sought to make a name through great deeds and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The fact that this idea has become so distorted into vainglorious characters like Frank is "symptomatic of the loss of genuine [[the_political_philosophy_in_house_of_cards | politics]] of our time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Politics as Spectacle and the Blurring of Reality

It might seem strange that a show about the American political system suspiciously lacks its central tenet: democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. In *House of Cards*, the political system is reduced to backroom dealings and media manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Frank states, "Democracy is so overrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, and likens Congress to a game of chess where pieces are concealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Public opinion is merely a variable to be manipulated, as seen when considering Claire's hair color or Peter Russo's phoenix narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The media, protected by the Constitution as integral to democracy, is depicted as part of a larger political game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Zoe Barnes is fed beneficial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, and Tom Yates is hired to write propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

German philosopher Carl Schmitt argued that debate and openness have become "mere [[politics_as_spectacle_in_house_of_cards | spectacle]] for the backroom dealings of party leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. French philosopher Jean Baudrillard takes this further, arguing that "there is no truth behind the lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. For Baudrillard, a lie concealing a truth is simple compared to modern media, where lies take on lives of their own, and information circulates like commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Frank and Zoe literally barter for information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Slugline, a new media standard, prioritizes being "edgy and bleeding edge" to the extent that Zoe's work isn't even checked before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Baudrillard states, "Where we think that information produces meaning, the opposite occurs. Information devours its own content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Frank encapsulates this by telling Zoe: "Is that true? It will be after you write it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

This circuit of information is seductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Frank Underwood is seductive, not just to characters like Tom Yates and Meecham, but to the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. His final act in Season 2, knocking his ring, leaves viewers with a feeling of awe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. The show forces viewers to question whether they enjoy the performance and if they are "doomed to fall in love with the real Frank Underwoods of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Ultimately, *House of Cards* is a multi-layered show about the [[the_political_philosophy_in_house_of_cards | politics]] of appearance, whether expressed through art or [[the_use_of_aesthetics_and_theater_in_house_of_cards | theater]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Whether this blurring of appearance and reality is a negative development is left up for debate, but currently, "it's looking pretty bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

[[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | Nihilism]] generally refers to philosophical, psychological, and ethical positions that share the premise that there is no inherent meaning, value, or order in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While often simplified to "believing in nothing," [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] is more complex and can form the basis for meaningful worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This article focuses on [[existential_nihilism_in_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]], as exemplified by the character BoJack Horseman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Understanding Existential Nihilism

[[existential_nihilism_in_bojack_horseman | Existential nihilism]] is the experience of realizing that life has no inherent meaning, and human existence is fundamentally a "precarious dance upon the grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In this view, individuals are responsible for creating their own meaning and values through their freedom and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Philosophical Roots

The term [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] was first coined in the late 18th century by German philosopher Friedrich Jacobi, who worried that Enlightenment reason would eliminate the conditions for religion by explaining away uncertainty and mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

#### Søren Kierkegaard: The Danish Doctor of Dread

One of the first philosophers to explore the implications of [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] was Søren Kierkegaard, considered a father of modern [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Kierkegaard believed that despair is an essential part of the human experience, referring to it as the "sickness unto death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This despair is dialectical, meaning individuals are constantly at odds with themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. It can arise from believing nothing is possible, or from feeling overwhelmed by the possibility of everything, leading to indecision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Despair also manifests as being unhappy with who one is, or being unable to be who one thinks they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Kierkegaard viewed anxiety as being caused by the uncertainty underlying every decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. He considered anxiety a manifestation of freedom, as the weight of personal responsibility for decisions leads to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. He described this anxiety as standing at the edge of an abyss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. For Kierkegaard, the path through despair and anxiety is the acceptance of the comic absurdity of reality and living by faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Faith, in this context, is the courage to strive for a meaningful existence in a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

#### Jean-Paul Sartre: Creating Meaning

Nearly a century after Kierkegaard, [[jeanpaul_sartres_radical_freedom_as_depicted_in_bojack_horseman | Jean-Paul Sartre]] developed the first explicitly [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | existentialist]] philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Sartre argued that [[absurdism_and_existentialism_in_the_series | existentialism]] provides a response to the meaninglessness of the universe by asserting that humans can create their own meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Despite the absence of inherent ethical value or divine comfort, individuals can forge meaning through their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. While [[existential_nihilism_in_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]] offers the possibility of a meaningful life, it provides no guarantees, placing the ongoing responsibility of meaning-making on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## BoJack Horseman's Existential Despair

The worldview of [[existential_nihilism_in_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]] fuels the character of BoJack Horseman, who famously states, "I’m responsible for my own happiness? I can’t even be responsible for my own breakfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

BoJack, a character who seemingly "has it all" with a successful acting career, wealth, and a beautiful home, cannot enjoy any of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Even when good things happen, he feels disappointed ("I feel...the same" after an Oscar nomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>) or sabotages his own happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. He is constantly marked by regret, and an unshakeable despair follows him regardless of his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

This pervasive melancholy, rooted in despair, affects many characters in *BoJack Horseman*, including Todd's worries about his sexuality and Princess Caroline's anxieties about motherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Mr. Peanutbutter, notably, appears to be an exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

BoJack's deep self-doubt and anxiety attacks, such as when he calls himself an "idiot" and a "piece of s**t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, mirror Kierkegaard's descriptions of despair and anxiety arising from the overwhelming freedom and responsibility of choice. His terrifying freedom sometimes leads him to destructive actions, including botched suicide attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The show concludes Season 4 with BoJack accepting the complexity of his relationship with his mother and deciding to find meaning in his new sister, Hollyhock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This reflects Kierkegaard's idea of finding faith or courage to pursue a meaningful existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Responsibility for Meaning

The series emphasizes the ongoing need to "keep living forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, as "closure is a made up thing by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This aligns with Kierkegaard's idea that one must "live forward and understand backwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Ultimately, [[existential_nihilism_in_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism]] acknowledges the possibility of love and meaning, but it requires continuous hard work without guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Shows like *BoJack Horseman* provide insight into the practical ramifications of this philosophical position, demonstrating that it is not about giving up but about finding approaches to navigate an uncertain world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

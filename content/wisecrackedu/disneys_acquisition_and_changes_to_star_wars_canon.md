Since 2012, when Disney acquired Lucasfilm, the *Star Wars* universe has experienced significant changes and a resultant fan backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This shift has led to a "legitimation crisis" within the *Star Wars* universe, a concept described by political philosopher Jurgen Habermas as an existential crisis that threatens the foundation of a social system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## The *Last Jedi* and Subverting Canon

Director Rian Johnson, helmer of *The Last Jedi*, intentionally aimed to "subvert the canon" or "kill the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This approach included:
*   **Rey's Parents** Revealed as "nobodies" instead of a prominent *Star Wars* lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Snoke's Demise** An "unceremonious death" without a backstory or reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Luke Skywalker's Character** Portraying the hero as disillusioned, throwing lightsabers, and nearly killing his nephew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

These decisions have led to a crisis in the *Star Wars* world, with Disney putting extended universe movies on hold and new spin-offs being panned by fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Star Wars as a Social System

Before Disney's acquisition, George Lucas was seen as the "divinely ordained monarch" of the *Star Wars* universe, which encompassed the six films and a multitude of spin-offs (video games, board games, cartoons, novels) that received the "Royal seal of approval" from Lucasfilm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Lucas's legitimacy stemmed from his creation of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Together, Lucas and fans formed a "fully functioning social system" with shared practices, beliefs, values, and rules, termed a "lifeworld" (lebenswelt) by Habermas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The general meaning, values, characters, stories, and themes of *Star Wars* were originally established by Lucas and broadly agreed upon within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This *Star Wars* universe also helped create a sense of individual identity for fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## The Regime Change and Legitimation Crisis

In 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm, initiating a "regime change" where, from some fans' perspectives, "Lord Lucas was replaced by a money-hungry animated mouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This acquisition and subsequent controversial decisions by Disney created a major [[philosophical_insights_into_the_star_wars_legitimation_crisis | legitimation crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Historical Parallel: The Catholic Church
The situation with *Star Wars* is likened to the Catholic Church's legitimation crisis in the 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Before the Printing Press** The Church held total control over the Bible's meaning, as only clergy had access to copies, and few could read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This allowed practices like selling indulgences to go unchallenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **After the Printing Press** Gutenberg's invention in 1440 enabled widespread reproduction of texts, allowing regular people to read the Bible and form their own interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This led to a crisis where the masses were no longer just consuming religious meaning but also producing canonical interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, challenging the Church's authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

In this metaphor, the original *Star Wars* universe is the "bible," with George Lucas as its writer and interpreter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Disney, as a larger, "fallible organization," now wields authority over this "quasi-holy text" or its canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Canonical Alterations and Fan Identity
Without Lucas's legitimacy, fans began to question Disney's changes to the "agreed upon values, meanings, and truths" of the *Star Wars* system, particularly in *The Last Jedi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Disney further impacted the community's identity by "decanonizing" a vast amount of previously established *Star Wars* content, including radio dramas, video games, comics, and hundreds of spin-off novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This act of "hacking and slashing what counts as Star Wars" directly affects fans, whose identities are deeply "wrapped up in this sh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## The Age of Prosumerism

Like the Catholic Church facing the "wrath of the educated masses," Disney now confronts a fan base that not only consumes media but also produces it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This phenomenon is termed "prosumerism," a technical term coined in the 1980s by futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler to describe the merging roles of producer and consumer in the modern technological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*Star Wars* fans are "prosumers extraordinaire," actively creating meaning through YouTube videos, video essays, fan theories, and social media engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Every theory or discussion about characters and lore contributes to the *Star Wars* universe, serving as a way for the community to "practice" *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

The rise of [[impact_of_prosumerism_on_star_wars_fandom | prosumerism]] empowers fans to criticize the "few anointed successors of Lucas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This shift has even led to directors like James Mangold (director of *Logan*) expressing concerns that writing for big franchises has become "the emotionally loaded equivalent of writing a new chapter of The Bible," potentially deterring "bolder minds" from participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## The Future of the Star Wars System

Despite the crisis, systems can learn and adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The Catholic Church, for example, did not crumble but revised its theology and re-solidified its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The question for *Star Wars* is whether Disney will evolve to respect fans and the universe they helped create, or if fans will adapt to the new system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Alternatively, a "reckoning" could occur, leading to a split between Disney and fans, much like the Catholics and Protestants, each creating their own versions of the *Star Wars* "religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

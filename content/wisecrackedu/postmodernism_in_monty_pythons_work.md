Monty Python redefined comedy in the 1970s, combining absurdity, satire, and postmodern-reflexivity into some of the most influential and quoted comedies ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Their influence is still evident in modern comedies like *South Park*, *Rick and Morty*, and even [[Postmodernism and Self Awareness in Deadpool | Deadpool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Defining Postmodernism
Postmodernism involves films and TV shows constantly referring back to themselves, commenting on narrative conventions and the iconography of their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This concept was first coined by French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Lyotard described "metanarratives" as grand mythologies or stories that provided a pattern and structure for people's beliefs, teaching universal insights, like *The Wizard of Oz* teaching about finding wisdom, courage, and heart within oneself, or *The Fast and The Furious* emphasizing the importance of family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Postmodernism, however, subverts these grand narratives, revealing the chaos and disorder beneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### [[Postmodernism and Self Awareness in Deadpool | Deadpool]] as a Postmodern Example
Nothing encapsulates the postmodern movement more than [[Postmodernism and Self Awareness in Deadpool | Deadpool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The character is rebelliously self-aware, winking at his own narrative and mocking the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. [[Postmodernism and Self Awareness in Deadpool | Deadpool]] tears down everything that comic books stand for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. However, Monty Python took postmodern deconstruction to an even greater level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Postmodern Deconstruction in *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*
While [[Postmodernism and Self Awareness in Deadpool | Deadpool]] lampoons only the comic book metanarrative, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is defined by breaking down multiple metanarratives, including Arthurian chivalry, Christianity, logic, and the very film medium itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Dismantling Arthurian Chivalry
Arthurian chivalry, which evolved in the Late Middle Ages, idealized knights as honorable and self-sacrificing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* completely dismantles and mocks these time-tested tenets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Sir Robin's minstrels sing a heroic narrative, but he "bravely ran away away" when facing a giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   Arthur's arrival at Camelot, typically an emotional high-point, is undercut by a goofy musical number, and he ultimately decides not to even bother going there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   The "great heroes" are revealed to be far less than they claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Arthur demands peasants acknowledge him as king and attacks those who question him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Sir Galahad is seduced in less than four minutes by "a hundred-and-sixty lonely women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Sir Lancelot murders dozens of unarmed people while rushing to rescue a distressed maiden who turns out not to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Monty Python uses postmodernism to illustrate how the stories people tell themselves enable "awful s***" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The knights' metanarratives justify their violent and oppressive acts, even though these narratives are revealed to be untrue, showing the heroes as cowards, hypocrites, and violent sociopaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Deconstructing Christianity
The Christian metanarrative portrays God as good, all-powerful, and having a plan for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. In *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, God is depicted as a "cranky dick" and is "crappily animated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This is what philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin defined as the "downward-swing," where a classical story becomes so distorted and grotesque that it's unclear whether to scream, cry, or laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This distortion extends to the audience, casting doubt on every lesson learned through the metanarrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Undermining Logic
The film also casts doubt on fundamental faith in logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. In the famous witch trial scene, Sir Bedevere the Wise applies a "foolproof" logic test: witches burn like wood, wood floats like a duck, therefore if a woman weighs the same as a duck, she is a witch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Monty Python distorts formal logic into a grotesque version of itself, questioning its trustworthiness if it can be manipulated to justify a woman's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Breaking the Fourth Wall and Film Medium
By the end of *The Holy Grail*, the distortion extends to the film itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   Modern-day police suddenly arrive and arrest Arthur for murder, then push and cover the camera lens, making the audience cognizant they are watching a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   The film's title credits are undermined by Swedish subtitles promoting vacation spots, followed by the credit-makers being fired and the format changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   Arthur uses coconuts instead of a horse due to the film's tight budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   Arthur refers to a character as "the old man from scene 24" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   The knights defeat the Legendary Black Beast of Arghhh because the animator designing the creature has a heart-attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

This self-reflexivity reveals *The Holy Grail* to be its own metanarrative, showing film as artificial as the chivalrous Arthurian heroes within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The film deconstructs religion and logic within a deconstruction of heroic tropes within a deconstruction of the film medium itself, making it "the ‘Inception’ of postmodern film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## The Pythonesque Legacy
The unpredictability and mixture of postmodern, political, and absurd humor make Monty Python unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. By merging social commentary, existential angst, and silliness, they defied convention and created a brand of comedy so singular that the word "Pythonesque" was created for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

The popular horror series *Saw*, which began in 2004, features the antagonist Jigsaw, who locks up morally dubious characters in gruesome traps [00:20:00]. While the films often focus on Jigsaw's high body count, there is a deeper meaning to his games, rooted in [[Philosophical Themes in the Saw Franchise | philosophical themes]] [00:49:00].

## Jigsaw's Motivation and Early Christian Parallels

The core of [[Philosophical Themes in the Saw Franchise | the philosophy of Saw]] lies in Jigsaw's motivation: his torturous games are designed to provide victims with an opportunity to repent for their sins and, ideally, transform into better human beings [01:07:00]. Jigsaw believes that if his victims survive his tests, they will emerge with a newfound appreciation for life [01:22:00]. This perspective positions Jigsaw as embodying an extremist Christian morality [01:38:00].

Before becoming Jigsaw, John Kramer was a civil engineer with a pregnant wife, Jill, who owned a drug rehab clinic [01:48:00]. Jill suffered a miscarriage after one of her patients, Cecil Adams, robbed her clinic [01:56:00]. John then faced a diagnosis of a brain tumor and terminal cancer, leading to deep depression and the deterioration of his relationship [02:05:00]. After a suicide attempt by driving off a cliff, he miraculously survived and found a new calling: dispensing morality through torture devices [02:31:00].

As John Kramer developed his new moral code, he appeared to draw inspiration from early Christian philosophy, particularly its views on suffering [02:53:00].

## The Christian Justification of Suffering

According to Early Christian tradition, God is good, and everything He created is inherently good [03:04:00]. However, the existence of suffering prompted Christian theologians to rationalize how an all-good God could have created it [03:17:00]. Their theory posited that suffering was the fault of "no-good, lousy humans" [03:25:00]. The Original Sin, committed by Adam when he ate from the Tree of Knowledge, was seen as separating humans from the pure, perfect God [03:29:00]. Consequently, sinful humans would need to suffer and repent to be reunited with God [03:42:00]. Suffering was thus understood as a result of human sins and an expression of the pain from separation from God, justifying it as the sinner's fault, not God's [03:48:00].

## Jigsaw's Echoes of Original Sin

Jigsaw's philosophy mirrors this Christian concept, as he believes his victims deserve the suffering they endure [04:02:00]. He often reminds them of the sins that led them to their traps [04:06:00]. Jigsaw sees his victims as enslaved by their past immorality, akin to how theologians believed humanity was trapped by Adam and Eve's original sin [04:18:00].

The *Saw* series even features characters named Adam, reinforcing this parallel:
*   In *Saw IV*, drug addict Cecil Adams is responsible for Jill's miscarriage, serving as a catalyst for John's transformation into Jigsaw and embodying an "original sin" [04:31:00].
*   In the first *Saw* film, Adam Stanheight, a photographer who spies on people, becomes a target [04:42:00]. His "professional quest for seedy 'knowledge'" parallels Adam's desire to eat from the Tree of Knowledge [04:49:00].

## Shared Beliefs with Kierkegaard

John Kramer also shares a common thread with [[Kierkegaards Influence on Jigsaws Philosophy | Christian theorist and father of Existentialism, Soren Kierkegaard]], who viewed suffering as critical for personal and spiritual growth [05:04:00]. Both men experienced significant personal hardships [05:15:00]. They believed that suffering purifies the sufferer, teaches them to appreciate life, and forces them to take responsibility for their actions [05:39:00].

[[Kierkegaards Influence on Jigsaws Philosophy | Kierkegaard]] proposed three phases of personal development to achieve the "true self":
1.  **The aesthetic:** Driven by sensual pleasures and lacking morality [05:51:00].
2.  **The ethical:** Driven by morality and belief in individual responsibility [06:01:00].
3.  **The religious:** Driven by faith in God [06:06:00].

[[Kierkegaards Influence on Jigsaws Philosophy | Kierkegaard]] believed suffering was key to progressing through these stages [06:17:00]. While he primarily referred to spiritual and existential suffering, Jigsaw's machines can be seen as tests for his victims, who are often "aesthetes" [06:23:00]. These tests present ethical dilemmas, forcing painful decisions and leading to "ethical self-understanding" [06:33:00].

Suffering, according to [[Kierkegaards Influence on Jigsaws Philosophy | Kierkegaard]], prompts reflection and "the first doubt"—the thought, "Why is this happening to me; can it not be otherwise?" [07:07:00]. This moment generates a desire to change circumstances, opening a person to ethical self-understanding [07:29:00]. At its most successful, suffering forces repentance, taking responsibility, and choosing survival [07:47:00].

Both Kramer and [[Kierkegaards Influence on Jigsaws Philosophy | Kierkegaard]] believe that development involves shedding a "false self" [07:57:00]. Kramer himself stated, "A different person crawled out through the wreckage" after his car crash [08:07:00]. For [[Kierkegaards Influence on Jigsaws Philosophy | Kierkegaard]], spiritual suffering aims to "completely kill off your flawed, false self in order to make room for your recreation into a better, truer self" [08:13:00]. This concept is evident when Kramer demands Amanda's full commitment, leading fans to call the scene "Amanda's baptism" [08:22:00]. This ties into the Christian idea of baptism as rebirth and spiritual cleansing, much like Jesus rising from the dead to redeem humanity [08:43:00]. Jigsaw frequently references this concept of rebirth [09:01:00].

Both [[Kierkegaards Influence on Jigsaws Philosophy | Kierkegaard]] and Jigsaw emphasize personal responsibility [09:33:00]. [[Kierkegaards Influence on Jigsaws Philosophy | Kierkegaard]] stated that becoming "a real man" involves becoming "a responsible individual before God" [09:36:00]. Kramer demands the same from his victims, emphasizing the importance of making a choice, as "in the moment of making a choice, a man 'becomes himself'" [09:55:00]. Kramer adamantly states that his victims "choose" their actions and are responsible for the outcome [10:16:00].

## Critique of Jigsaw's Moral Code

Despite these philosophical underpinnings, *Saw* critiques this extreme version of traditional Christian morality [10:49:00]. Kramer is portrayed as a God-like figure—a monk or martyr—dressing in a black hooded cape, acquiring disciples, and performing "baptisms" [10:54:00]. He maintains an air of omniscience, constantly observing his victims [11:05:00].

However, Jigsaw is ultimately depicted as a failed God-like figure [11:10:00]. His attempt to establish moral order does not bring about the meaningful change he professes [11:16:00]. Most victims fail or are traumatized if they survive [11:21:00]. His apprentices, notably, corrupt his philosophy, creating unwinnable "death traps" instead of "winnable" games [11:43:00]. They use the games for revenge, leading to cycles of jealousy, trapping, and killing each other [12:08:00]. The point of the games for them becomes punishment, not renewal [12:16:00]. Even Amanda, his most fervent follower, eventually denounces him [12:31:00].

Jigsaw's justice is not dispensed fairly, often sacrificing innocent lives, reinforcing his villain status [12:38:00]. His own death results from one of his tests' ultimate failures, as his victim, Jeff, violently kills him rather than forgiving him [12:50:00].

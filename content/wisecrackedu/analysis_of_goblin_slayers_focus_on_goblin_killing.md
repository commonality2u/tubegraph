*Goblin Slayer* immediately traumatizes viewers within its first ten minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While much of the conversation around the show focuses on its notorious opening scene, a significant development for the [[subversion_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]] revolves around the question: why does Goblin Slayer only kill goblins, and how does that form the show's greater message? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

## Series Overview
The story begins with a bright-eyed Priestess and her friends embarking on their first adventure to kill goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. When things go terribly wrong and her friends die, Goblin Slayer rescues her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. She then joins his party as his "goblin slaying padawan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Their party expands to include an Elf, Dwarf, and Lizardman, who join to investigate concerning goblins on the elven border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Despite a Demon Lord threatening the realm, Goblin Slayer remains singularly focused on eliminating goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The show is heavy on references to Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), featuring dice rolling, spell slots, guilds, quests, and a hodgepodge of other [[subversion_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy tropes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It embraces the generic nature of the [[subversion_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]], giving characters and places intentionally generic names like "Elven Ranger," "Watertown," or "Sword Maiden," and even bosses like "Goblin Champion" or "Demon Lord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Subversion of Fantasy Tropes
Traditional [[subversion_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]] narratives, whether in novels, tabletop games, or MMORPGs, typically depict [[critique_of_heroism_and_societal_roles_in_goblin_slayer | heroes]] starting with minor challenges (rats, bugs, goblins) before progressing to stronger enemies and ultimately confronting a horrifying villain who threatens the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The story builds from small problems to a big one, implying that once the "big bad" is slain, "things can go back to being peachy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

*Goblin Slayer* explicitly steps off this linear path by having its protagonist insist on only killing goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Goblin Slayer rationalizes his choice, arguing that even if the Demon Lord dies, goblins will continue to terrorize rural and vulnerable areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. By focusing on these "little guys," the show [[subversion_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | subverts the basic assumptions of the fantasy genre]], particularly the notion of a "happily ever after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. A litany of less spectacular monsters still plagues villagers even after a major threat is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

This subversion is further exemplified by the swift, off-screen dispatch of the Demon Lord by random [[critique_of_heroism_and_societal_roles_in_goblin_slayer | heroes]] who are neither known nor cared about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Instead of a happy ending, the show reminds the audience of the Sword Maiden's words:
> "Evil doesn't die. It changes shape and comes back in a new form." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>

## Peace Theory
Goblin Slayer's logic can be understood through [[understanding_peace_theory_in_the_context_of_goblin_slayer | peace theory]], which explores the nature of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Theorist John Galtung distinguishes between two types of peace:
*   **Negative Peace**: The absence of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. In the [[subversion_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy genre]], this is akin to a world without major villains like the Night King, Sauron, or Ganondorf – a world where Demon Lords are no longer destroying the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. However, this definition fails to address the smaller, more pervasive violence affecting society's most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Positive Peace**: The presence of justice and protections that serve everyone's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This is what Goblin Slayer pursues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While the show features goblins, in the real world, "positive peace" would address issues like poverty, famine, disease, corruption, discrimination, and crime – the "goblins of the real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

[[understanding_peace_theory_in_the_context_of_goblin_slayer | Positive peace]] is crucial for understanding violence because for many, violence is not an interruption but the constant backdrop of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Goblin Slayer cannot simply relax on an idyllic farm with Cow Girl; he must constantly search for goblin signs and fortify defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. In his view, the very structure of the world ensures that people in rural areas will always face goblin attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. His focus on burning down goblin nests, while not overtly peaceful, represents conflict prevention and development, initiating long-term protection by addressing immediate threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Critique of Heroism and Societal Roles
The show highlights how smaller issues, when compounded, can create a similarly dire reality for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The "small work" required to address these issues is often shunned as "grunt work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Everyone seeks the glory of defeating a Demon Lord, but "chopping goblins" is seen as "child's play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Even after the Demon Lord is gone, the cleanup of his armies is considered beneath some [[critique_of_heroism_and_societal_roles_in_goblin_slayer | heroes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

> "To them, goblins are nothing but a common pest, a trivial obstacle." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>

Despite being a silver-class adventurer, Goblin Slayer faces ridicule for his chosen missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He is compared to a general cleaning latrines, emphasizing that in his world, essential "janitorial" work goes undone because no one wants to do it, leading to widespread problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This mirrors real-life scenarios where jobs offering glory (like cancer research) receive more attention than routine, preventative work (like water testing), or high-paying, high-prestige jobs are chosen over those with greater social impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Goblin Slayer initially wanted to kill dragons as a child, but personal experience with the dangers of goblins led him to commit to his specific mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

This problem is compounded by two factors:
1.  **Stigma and Minimization**: The stigma against goblin slaying causes many to minimize the threat goblins pose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. While seemingly simple to kill, goblins have tricks that make them very dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Because they are perceived as a minor problem, unqualified individuals are sent to deal with them, while silver-ranked [[critique_of_heroism_and_societal_roles_in_goblin_slayer | heroes]] feel they "have better things to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This leads to the murder of inexperienced adventurers and the persistence of goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
2.  **Escalation of the Problem**: The problem worsens as goblins breed and become more dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Major [[critique_of_heroism_and_societal_roles_in_goblin_slayer | heroes]] avoid involvement, either seeing goblins as mere pests or being too embarrassed to admit their true threat after having defeated greater foes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

The Sword Maiden, a powerful leader who even slayed the original Demon Lord, hires Goblin Slayer to deal with goblins under the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. It becomes apparent that she herself committed "light murder" to ensure someone else dealt with the goblins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This is because she was afraid after her own traumatic encounter, and admitting fear of goblins after defeating a Demon Lord goes against the unspoken [[critique_of_heroism_and_societal_roles_in_goblin_slayer | hero]] code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Goblin attacks can leave people in a constant state of fear and anxiety, exacerbating an already difficult life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Goblin Slayer's intervention, by killing the goblins and talking to the Sword Maiden about her fears, significantly impacts her well-being, freeing her from goblin nightmares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Narrative Implications
This unique approach to [[subversion_of_fantasy_genre_tropes_in_goblin_slayer | fantasy]] raises questions about the show's narrative trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Normally, threats escalate throughout a series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. However, with the Demon Lord already defeated and Goblin Slayer committed solely to goblins, the challenge lies in finding creative ways to raise the stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This might involve more ambiguity regarding the goblin threat, as a false sense of security takes hold across the land, keeping the goblin problem in obscurity for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

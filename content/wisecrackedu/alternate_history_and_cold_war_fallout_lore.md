The *Fallout* series is set in the 23rd century within an alternate reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. In this world, the culture of the 1950s never truly died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, and a prevalent Cold War mentality persisted until the very end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This unique setting provides a "goldmine of philosophical analysis" within its [[the_exploration_of_humanity_in_postapocalyptic_settings | apocalyptic fiction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Great War

The world plunged into a global conflict after nations began running out of oil in the 2050s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This conflict culminated in 2077 when nuclear powers launched their arsenals at each other, initiating a new "dark age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The result was a nuclear war that completely devastated Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Technological Divergence

In this alternate reality, the mid-20th century saw a proliferation of fascination with atomic power, which was never offset by the invention of the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. As a result, *Fallout*'s pre-war society is technologically advanced, but in a different way than our own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Technology is often bulky, and computers are primitive compared to modern ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. However, this society also boasts advanced power armor and laser guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Pre-War Society and Propaganda

The "Wasteland," the nightmare landscape of the game, is filled with reminders of the pre-war world's sheer optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This was an age of atomic energy where "our greatest dreams could be accomplished with a little ingenuity and maybe a few giant anti-communist death robots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Optimism and Cognitive Dissonance

This optimism is most apparent in the Vaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Even with imminent nuclear annihilation, remnant Vault posters maintain a cheerful demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Many Vaults, however, were actually covers for the government to conduct "insane experiments" on residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The Vaults serve as a "testament to the human power of [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | cognitive dissonance]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The terrifying prospect of being locked underground for an indefinite period is advertised as an "exciting foray" to meet new friends and raise a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. These Vaults are a callback to real-life luxury bomb shelters from the Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Herbert Marcuse's Critique

German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse discussed these "mental gymnastics" during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He argued that pleasant appearances plastered over "modern day nightmares" demonstrated modern society's ability to "destroy criticism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Marcuse suggested that capitalism is so effective at marketing that it makes even terrible realities seem "dandy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. He cited real-life "deluxe fallout shelters" with televisions, lounge chairs, and Scrabble boards as the ultimate example of the "obscene merger" between a cozy luxury getaway and a truly awful situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Humor and Ironic Disparity

This disparity between appearance and reality is a driving force behind the humor in *Fallout* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Players are constantly confronted with contrary images, such as the quaint, cheerful 1950s-esque culture set within a hellscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This is also observed in the game's radio stations, which play chipper jazz tunes while the player fends off irradiated remnants of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. For example, the song "I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire" is used prominently, playing on its innocent romanticism against imagery of Washington D.C.'s burnt-out remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, ironically, since the world *was* literally set on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Cole Porter’s upbeat "Anything Goes," a song about lax morals, serves as a nod to the absolute anarchy of the Wasteland, where cannibalism is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

These "marriages between positive and negative, happy and sad, dream and nightmare" are not just comedic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. They represent the mechanism by which society "constantly celebrat[es] the same culture and technology that consistently puts us at the brink of total annihilation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This can be viewed as a [[philosophical_critiques_of_society_and_government_in_fallout | criticism of government propaganda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### One-Dimensional Thought and The Enclave

Marcuse argued that we live in an age of "one-dimensional thought," where positive and negative merge, allowing rationality and [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] to only move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Society is told that technology is "always good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. While there's room to debate how to bring order to the Wasteland or kill Communists, there is no room for "negative thought" or ideas that undermine society's "one-dimensional, inane positivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This is starkly shown at the beginning of *Fallout 3*, where the player is trapped at their own birthday party until they achieve "sufficient fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Another way to ensure compliance in a twisted reality is to make people "too happy to care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This concept is embodied by [[factions_and_politics_in_fallout | The Enclave]], the remnants of the United States government who seek to purge the Wasteland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. John Henry Eden, the "president" of the United States, is revealed to be a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Eden understands the importance of fun and leisure in an obedient society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. In his radio addresses, he praises baseball as a "savior to the American dream," promoting comfort and recreation as hallmarks of pre-war society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

The Wasteland is littered with reminders of pre-war excess, such as leisure suits, magazines, and televisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. These comforts offer an easy way to cope with horrific realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Eden attempts to resurrect this "distracted society" that initially led to the nuclear catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, even as he simultaneously plans to exterminate those he seeks to distract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Technology Run Amok

From the Great War that decimated the world to secret government experiments creating Super Mutants, *Fallout* constantly reminds the player of [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] run amok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Technology is presented as a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, leading to [[moral_dilemmas_and_security_logic_in_apocalyptic_worlds | moral dilemmas]] regarding its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

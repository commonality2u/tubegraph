*The Incredibles* is a Pixar film that explores humanity's reaction to individuals who possess qualities of greatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The movie begins fifteen years after all superpowered humans were forced into hiding by "lawyers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The protagonists, Bob and Helen Incredible, have settled into a traditional suburban life with their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Suppression of Greatness and Herd Morality

The film portrays a society where "Supers" are compelled to hide and suppress their abilities to avoid persecution by a society of "inferior beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This societal pressure is exemplified by Helen's statement: "Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we've just gotta be like everybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

This concept aligns with what is referred to as "Freddy Nietzchmeister's concept of the herd morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Herd morality suggests that society "demonizes and inhibits the exceptional in favor of appeasing the basic bitches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The Incredibles family observes with frustration how society rewards non-achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The narrative highlights the creation of "new ways to celebrate mediocrity" while suppressing genuine exceptionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Society insists that "everyone is special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, which is countered by the idea that if everyone is special, then "no one is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

This enforced equality carries a significant psychological cost for exceptional individuals and ultimately harms society at large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. An example of this is when Buddy, an ordinary person, interferes with Mr. Incredible's attempt to capture Bomb Voyage, allowing the criminal to escape and nearly causing a train full of "normies" to be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This incident is presented as a consequence of "mediocrity" obstructing "excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## The Nature of Greatness: Born or Made?

The film initially appears to suggest that ordinary people can achieve greatness through determination and effort, as seen in Buddy's transformation into Syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Syndrome builds an empire of technological innovation from humble beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

However, *The Incredibles* quickly refutes this notion, demonstrating that Syndrome's "manufactured greatness" is inferior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Ultimately, the day is saved by the Incredibles, whose superpowers are innate and require "no indignity of effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The film asserts that "one cannot aspire to greatness â€” one must be born with it," emphasizing that their abilities are "in your blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Conclusion: Great People Deserve Great Things

Ultimately, *The Incredibles* conveys the message that "great people deserve great things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The Supers reclaim their "rightful place at the top of the societal food chain" due to their inherent gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Dash being allowed to dominate his school athletic program, provided he's subtle about his enhanced abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Violet immediately attracting "the dreamiest boy on campus" after a new haircut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

The film concludes with the Incredibles "murdering" the "poor, confused boy who was just fighting for equality in a world of superheroes" (Syndrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

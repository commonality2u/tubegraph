Season One of *Breaking Bad*, created by Vince Gilligan, introduces the story of Walter White, a 50-year-old man who embarks on a new venture: the manufacture of methamphetamine, joined by Jesse Pink-man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This season establishes many core [[american_dream_and_moral_decline_in_breaking_bad | themes]] and [[use_of_color_symbolism_in_breaking_bad | symbols]] that define the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Critiques of American Systems

Beneath its crime drama exterior, *Breaking Bad* is a powerful [[critique_of_american_healthcare_and_economic_systems_in_breaking_bad | critique of struggling American healthcare and economic systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Within these systems, both the highly educated Walter White and Jesse Pink-man, despite his own ambitions, routinely fail to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## The Failed American Dream

Walter White initially appears to be living what was once naively called the "American Dream," complete with a son, a shiny plaque, and a seemingly respectable life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, this dream has failed him, as he struggles to provide adequately for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Only by operating outside the law can Walter achieve the respect and mobility he desperately desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Character Metamorphosis and Moral Decline

Walter White's journey in Season One is presented as a profound metamorphosis, with his expertise in chemistry serving as a metaphor for his changing and troubled psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

*   **Pilot Episode** In his chemistry class, Walter outlines the theme of his own transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Episode 2** His lecture on thalidomide chirality directly points to his own shifting morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Episode 6** Another presentation hints that Walter himself may be a volatile substance, like ammonium nitrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Ironically, by taking drastic measures to earn money for his cancer treatment, Walter effectively becomes a "societal cancer," gaining energy for himself while contributing to the deterioration of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Jesse's Struggle for Legitimacy

Throughout the season, Jesse Pink-man attempts to achieve societal legitimacy but consistently finds himself marginalized, even by his own family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Key Symbols

### [[use_of_color_symbolism_in_breaking_bad | Use of Color Symbolism]]

Season One frequently uses the color yellow to foreshadow threats and dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Examples include yellow mustard stains, bright yellow "hoopties" (cars), and broken yellow plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Background Televisual Programming

The shared incompetence of Walter and Jesse in criminal matters is subtly reflected by the background television programming shown during their scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Bacon

Walter's inability to "bring home sub-par bacon" serves as a metaphor for his failure to adequately provide for his family through conventional means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Alter Ego

Walter's creation of a "freshly haberdashered new alter ego" symbolizes his embrace of a new identity outside the law to achieve respect and mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

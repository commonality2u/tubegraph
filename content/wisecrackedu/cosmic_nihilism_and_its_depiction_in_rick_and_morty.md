[[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | Cosmic nihilism]] is a philosophical position arguing that there is no inherent truth or meaning in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. It posits that human-constructed meanings such as freedom, love, hope, and joy are merely myths used to cope with the "empty void at the center of our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. From this perspective, even the meanings humans create are seen as fables or coping mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

For a [[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic nihilist]], keeping busy while awaiting the universe's heat death is acceptable, but the idea of creating genuine meaning is considered self-delusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Rick Sanchez: The Embodiment of Cosmic Nihilism

The character of Rick Sanchez in *Rick and Morty* largely embodies the philosophy of [[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Rick openly admits that nothing matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. He famously declares, "When you know nothing matters the universe is yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Rick's perspective suggests that the universe is an "animal" that "grazes on the ordinary" and "creates infinite idiots just to eat them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. He believes that while smart individuals might "climb on top" and "take reality for a ride," it will inevitably "throw you and eventually it will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

> "Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere...everybody's gonna die...come watch TV?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>

This philosophy explains Rick's hedonism, as he spends his days partaking in orgies and drinking to stupor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. His belief in science appears to be more a way to pass time than a means to improve the lives of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. *Rick and Morty* frequently establishes Rick as this type of [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | nihilist]], reducing everything to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The show further reinforces this by presenting a universe that is not only cold and uncaring but also infinite in number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Rick states, "Nothing you think matters matters. This isn't special. This is happening infinite times across infinite realities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings

While not a [[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic nihilist]] himself, Friedrich Nietzsche is considered a spiritual forefather of this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Nietzsche's adage "God is dead" is often misinterpreted as meaning that everything sucks and there is no meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. However, [[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic nihilism]] is not a value judgment or a counter-ethics to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Unlike [[Nietzschean philosophy and its application in Rick and Morty | Nietzschean nihilism]], [[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic nihilism]] takes a colder, more rationalist approach, asserting no inherent value to existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Eliminative Materialism

Rick's philosophy aligns with eliminative materialism, championed by Patricia and Paul Churchland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This position argues for dropping common-sense psychological attitudes in favor of scientific and empirical notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. For example, concepts like love are dismissed as folk psychology, described simply as chemical processes in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Rick articulates this view directly: "What people call love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. He believes human emotions are "fundamentally bullshit" and that access to infinite timelines "precludes the necessity of attachment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### The Illusion of Self

Philosopher Thomas Metzinger's ideas also resonate with Rick's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Metzinger argues that the human self does not truly exist, instead being a "jumbled network of neurons and chemicals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. The self is merely a "useful fantasy" or "psychological fairytale" to make sense of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. If this is true, then humanity has no real purpose or unique soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

*Rick and Morty* frequently trivializes the self and consciousness, as seen when Rick's creations become sentient and experience existential crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. For example, the butter-passing robot asks, "What is my purpose?" to which Rick replies, "You pass butter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Ethical Implications

[[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | Cosmic nihilism]] tends to be misanthropic, a theme strongly associated with Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. His primary reason for spending time with Morty is that Morty's "stupidity serves as an interdimensional cloaking device" for Rick's genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

This rejection of the self makes [[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic nihilism]] less prone to ethics than [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | existential nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. The freedom celebrated by [[philosophy_and_existentialism_in_rick_and_morty | existentialists]] is considered another illusion for the [[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic nihilist]], leaving no ground for ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Without any value to build an ethical system, one is free to do whatever they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This is exemplified by Rick's actions, such as selling guns to a murderer to play video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, or turning an entire planet into monsters, killing himself, abandoning his family, and then calmly having a beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Rick's [[the_concept_of_meaninglessness_in_rick_and_morty | cosmic nihilism]] makes him a philosophical relative of characters like Rust Cohle from *True Detective*, who states, "In philosophical terms I'm what's called a pessimist... we are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody. When in fact everybody's nobody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Contrast with Existential Nihilism

While [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | existential nihilism]] (as depicted in *[[comparison_of_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty_vs_bojack_horseman | BoJack Horseman]]*) allows for the possibility of creating meaning and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, [[Nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty | cosmic nihilism]] offers a "less optimistic branch of [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | nihilism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. It denies the possibility of genuine meaning, even that which is self-created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Despite its bleak outlook, neither type of [[Nihilism and existential themes in Rick and Morty | nihilism]] is about giving up completely. Both offer approaches to moving forward in a largely uncertain world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

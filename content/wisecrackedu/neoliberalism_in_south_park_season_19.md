*South Park* Season 19 is a serialized narrative that tells an overarching story from episode to episode, unlike much earlier seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It chronicles the small Colorado town as it experiences significant social changes, introduces a new central character, and comments on America’s current political climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This season is arguably the smartest season yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Meta-Commentary on the Show Itself

One of the cleverest aspects of Season 19 is its layered commentary, not only on the modern social condition but also on *South Park* the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The season opens with the firing of Principal Victoria, with a new person appointed to make South Park Elementary "a more progressive place that fits in with today's times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This directly reflects the question of whether *South Park*'s signature vulgar sensibility can survive in a [[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | politically correct]] world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Comments about the town changing can be interpreted as a meta-commentary on the show facing change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Characters like Officer Barbrady and Mr. Garrison embody the struggle against these perceived changes, being described as "from another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Neoliberalism as the Unifying Theme

The season’s seemingly disparate themes of gentrification, [[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | PC culture]], and advertising are neatly tied together by the concept of neoliberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

> [!info] What is Neoliberalism?
> In a nutshell, neoliberalism is an [[Economic lessons from South Park | economic ideology]] that stresses personal freedoms and market solutions to address society’s problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. As Philosopher Henry Giroux puts it, its tenets include:
> 1.  Consumerism as the most important duty of a citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
> 2.  Individual freedoms trumping public freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
> 3.  All public social issues addressed on a private level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Gentrification and Market Solutions

Neoliberalism's goal is to make everything marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Gentrification, for example, is presented as the free market’s way of dealing with "shitty neighborhoods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. It involves real estate developers and business interests taking advantage of low prices to sell "white people overpriced tapas" without fixing underlying poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Even diversity and multiculturalism are depicted as serving profit, becoming marketable brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### PC Culture as Verbal Gentrification and Advertising

The season famously states:
> "What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness, in order to create a false sense of paradise? Only one thing can actually live in that world: ads." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>

The show suggests that advertisers manipulate [[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | PC culture]] to gentrify areas, highlighting how "otherness and diversity have just become marketable brands in order to sell anything and everything" in a neoliberal economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Ads in the show are portrayed as evolving to take human form, ready to assimilate or destroy everything in their path, operating behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This leads to anxiety about whether friends, family, or even oneself are just "ads or sponsored content," questioning the authenticity of one's own ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The danger of ads lies in their ability to cover up reality and distract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The end result is "reduced versions of ourselves, of cultures, that can be neatly packaged and sold," where "cultures of social acceptance" are more brands than actual tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Cooptation of Diversity

Neoliberalism excels at cooptation, a process of taking what was once outside the system and assimilating it to serve the needs of [[Capitalism and small businesses in South Park | capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. It absorbs identities and diversity, making multiculturalism a "trendy brand to be purchased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. For the town of South Park to advance economically, they must adopt "marks of tolerance" to attract businesses and new residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Whole Foods as a Symbol

Whole Foods serves as a focal point for many of the progressive changes in South Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Its arrival coincides with the town getting its "first gay kids" and a "police-free environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The show suggests that Whole Foods has ceased to be merely a place to buy organic food; instead, it embodies "lofty ideals that we buy into every time we purchase that $6 bottle of Asparagus Water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The spectacle of inclusion (e.g., showering Craig and Tweek with money for being gay) is explicitly shown to be "good for business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. In the neoliberal economy, this "spectacle of inclusion is sold just like any other commodity," leading to a "healthy dose of self righteousness" for the consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Critique of PC Culture and Self-Satisfying Activism

Slovenian theorist Slavoj Zizek is referenced, arguing that modern political systems can be more dangerous because they are "so dang pleasant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It's easier to identify a clear villain (like the KKK) than to critique a pleasant façade like that of the PC bros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

[[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | Political correctness]] is described by Zizek as "just a form of self-discipline which doesn’t really allow you to overcome [racism, misogyny, and so on]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. If PC culture is dangerous, it's because it's a "nice paint job over the same old discriminatory reality," with "no longer a clear villain to rally against, just self-satisfying acts of social justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Whole Foods Charity and Inter-Passivity

The "progressive" world of South Park involves people spending hundreds at Whole Foods but feeling good by donating $1 to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This "Whole Food style charity" is seen as the "perfect marriage between inaction and action," where rebellion becomes another commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Criticism is disarmed because one can be a "good neoliberal consumer" and still feel like they're fighting the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

Zizek's concept of *inter-passivity* is introduced, denoting the practice of doing things *not* to achieve something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. [[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | PC culture]] fits the formula of "Let’s go on changing something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The show attacks this hypocrisy, revealing the town's true feelings about the poor when Whole Foods is surrounded by the homeless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Token Multiculturalism and Narcissism

Multiculturalism becomes a "badge to wear, to buy into, rather than a real political project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The town's residents are still ignorant but feign knowledge of other cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The show questions whether token inclusion genuinely leads to inclusivity or is merely "a shell of actual diversity that is meant to boost ratings rather than understand another culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This show of tolerance is ultimately "about making white liberals feel good than the marginalized people they seek to help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

The PC frathouse, despite its talk of marginalized people, is entirely white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Their fervent passion to help the disabled is depicted as a cover for other motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Jean Baudrillard's "charity cannibalism" is mentioned, where "other people's destitution becomes our adventure playground" to secure the "reproduction of the catastrophe market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If tragedies run out, they are invented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. PC Principal's interaction with Jimmy and Nathan illustrates this: he seeks a "helpless victim" whose outrage aligns with his own narrative, disempowering the victim who is "only be validated by virtue of their helplessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Zizek argues that this form of [[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | PC culture]] is more intolerant because it accepts everyone only if they can be "pigeonhole[d] them into a type of difference we can consume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Celebrating figures like Caitlyn Jenner (despite controversies) becomes a simple, consumable way for society to "congratulate ourselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### The Narcissism Fueling Both Sides

The show critiques the deep-rooted narcissism behind both political extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Much of buying into the [[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | PC brand]] is about "making yourself feel good than affecting real change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Randy's charity morphs into one where children in developing countries are given iPads to protect the "fragile egos of people like Randy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This "Whole Foods activism" is about "being a sell-out to the system while making meaningless gestures to protect your own sense of self-worth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Cartman, a known narcissist, adopts [[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | PC culture]] and safe space language to protect his ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Conversely, Mr. Garrison's "fuck-em-all-to-death" attitude and American exceptionalism represent a nationalist "special snowflake" complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. His desire to build a wall against Canadians, only to find a Canadian wall built first to keep him out, highlights his self-obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Neoliberalism, by promoting a culture of consumerism centered on the individual, fuels "self obsession en masse," resulting in a "cult of victimhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. For Mr. Garrison, it's paranoid delusion; for the PC crowd, it's the mistaken idea that avoiding victimhood means others must entertain their "illusions of grandeur," leading to the privileged aspiring to victimhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

*South Park*'s creators probably don’t hate every aspect of [[Political Correctness and its Critique in South Park | PC culture]], but rather the "shallow versions of it propagated in the mainstream media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. PC Principal undergoes a redemption arc, murdering "inauthentic" PC bros after realizing he was manipulated by ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The show acknowledges the creators' own "privileged position" as "two privileged straight white boys who have theirs laughs about things we've never had to deal with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

The finale makes it clear that PC Principal is "here to stay," with Stan commenting, "This is gonna be really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This reflects the difficulty of avoiding bigotry while simultaneously sidestepping the pitfalls of phony inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The show must navigate the current political climate, and like any TV show, it needs ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

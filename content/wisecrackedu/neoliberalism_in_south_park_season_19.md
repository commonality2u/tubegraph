*[[South Park Season 19 and serialized storytelling | South Park]]* Season 19, which aired almost 20 years into the show's run, distinguishes itself from earlier seasons by presenting a serialized narrative with an overarching story from episode to episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While the idea was explored in Season 18, Season 19's serialization was much more comprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This season is considered arguably the smartest yet, chronicling significant social changes in the fictional Colorado town, introducing a new central character, and commenting on America’s current political climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Meta-Commentary and Political Correctness

A clever aspect of Season 19 is its layered commentary, addressing both modern social conditions and the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The season begins with Principal Victoria's firing and the appointment of a new principal aiming to make South Park Elementary "a more progressive place that fits in with today's times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This narrative mirrors the question of whether *[[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | South Park's]]* signature vulgarity can survive in a politically correct world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The changes within the town can be interpreted as *[[meta_commentary_on_political_satire_in_south_park | meta-commentary]]* on the show facing change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The Mayor explicitly tells Officer Barbrady that he is "from another time" and the "last thing that needs to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, reinforcing the theme of evolving societal norms.

While some might interpret the PC plotline as *[[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | Trey Parker]]* and *[[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | Matt Stone]]* simply critiquing liberal politics, their libertarian leanings often evade a simple left/right categorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Neoliberalism as the Unifying Theme

The season's seemingly disparate themes—gentrification, PC culture, and advertising—are neatly tied together by the concept of neoliberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

> "What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness, in order to create a false sense of paradise? Only one thing can actually live in that world: ads." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>

### Definition of Neoliberalism
Neoliberalism is an economic ideology that emphasizes personal freedoms and market-based solutions for societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Philosopher Henry Giroux outlines its tenets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
1.  *[[Consumerism and social commentary in South Park | Consumerism]]* is the most important civic duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
2.  Individual freedoms supersede public freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
3.  All public social issues are addressed privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Gentrification and Marketability
Neoliberalism's primary goal is to make everything marketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Gentrification, for example, is presented as the free market's way of dealing with "shitty neighborhoods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. It involves real estate developers and businesses exploiting low prices and "industrial chic" to sell overpriced goods without resolving underlying poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Even diversity and multiculturalism become tools for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The show suggests that advertisers manipulate *[[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]]* to gentrify areas, turning "otherness and diversity" into marketable brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The ads are portrayed as "grossly inhuman forces of neoliberal capitalism" that have taken human form, ready to assimilate or destroy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This raises anxiety about whether friends, family, or even TV shows are merely "ads or sponsored content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, questioning the origin of our own ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Ads are dangerous because they "cover up the reality of the situation, to distract us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, reducing cultures and identities into "neatly packaged and sold" versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Cooptation and the Spectacle of Inclusion
Neoliberalism excels at "cooptation"—assimilating elements outside the system to serve capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. It absorbs identities and diversity, making multiculturalism a "trendy brand to be purchased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The show uses Whole Foods as a focal point for the progressive changes in South Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The town adopts "marks of tolerance" to attract businesses and residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, with Whole Foods symbolizing these ideals rather than just a place to buy organic food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The show depicts people showering Craig and Tweek with money for being gay, conveying that the "spectacle of inclusion is good for business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This "spectacle of inclusion" is sold as a commodity, providing consumers with a "healthy dose of self righteousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Critique of PC Culture and Narcissism
Slavoj Zizek's theories suggest that modern political systems can be more dangerous due to their "pleasant" facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Unlike clear villains, PC culture, with its "pleasant facade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, becomes a "form of self-discipline which doesn’t really allow you to overcome [racism, misogyny, and so on]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This "nice paint job over the same old discriminatory reality" makes it difficult to rally against a clear villain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The new "progressive" world of South Park involves high spending at places like Whole Foods while performing token gestures of charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This "Whole Food style charity" represents a marriage between inaction and action, where change and rebellion become commodities, disarming criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Zizek argues that rebellion is tolerated within acceptable bounds, leading to "inter-passivity" where actions are performed "NOT in order to achieve something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. He describes *[[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | political correctness]]* as a means to "go on changing something all the time so that, globally, things will remain the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

The show critiques economic hypocrisy, especially when the town's true feelings about the poor emerge as Whole Foods is surrounded by homeless people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Multiculturalism becomes a "badge to wear" rather than a genuine political project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The show’s metacriticism questions whether token inclusion genuinely fosters inclusivity or merely boosts ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, concluding that such tolerance is often "more about making white liberals feel good than the marginalized people they seek to help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Jean Baudrillard's concept of "charity cannibalism" is introduced to describe how "other people's destitution becomes our adventure playground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, continually reproducing a "catastrophe market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The show suggests that when real tragedies are scarce, people invent their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. PC Principal's interaction with Jimmy and Nathan highlights how the "protector-victim" relationship disempowers the victim, whose validation comes from their helplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This PC culture, Zizek argues, can be more intolerant to other cultures, accepting differences only if they can be pigeonholed and consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Neoliberalism and the Cult of Victimhood
*[[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | South Park]]* reliably critiques both sides of the political spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Underlying both extremes is a deep-rooted narcissism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Buying into the PC brand often serves to make oneself feel good rather than enacting real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Randy's transformation of charity into a means for protecting the egos of privileged individuals exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This "Whole Foods activism" is portrayed as "being a sell-out to the system while making meaningless gestures to protect your own sense of self-worth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

Cartman, a known narcissist, adopts PC culture and "safe space" language to protect his ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. On the other side, Mr. Garrison's "fuck-em-all-to-death attitude" and "American exceptionalism" reflect a nationalist "special snowflake" complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Neoliberalism, by promoting a *[[consumerism_and_social_commentary_in_south_park | culture of consumerism]]* centered on the individual, fuels this mass self-obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, leading to a "cult of victimhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This manifests as paranoid delusions for Mr. Garrison and the mistaken idea for the PC crowd that not being a victim means having their illusions of grandeur entertained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Conclusion
*[[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | South Park's creators]]* acknowledge that not everyone advocating for safe spaces or loving their country fits these extreme caricatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. They critique "shallow versions" of *[[political_correctness_and_its_critique_in_south_park | PC culture]]* propagated in mainstream media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. PC Principal's redemption, when he learns of ad manipulation and attacks "inauthentic" PC bros, illustrates this nuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The creators also demonstrate self-awareness about their "privileged straight white boys" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

The finale confirms PC Principal is here to stay, with Stan acknowledging that navigating genuine inclusivity while avoiding "phony inclusion" is "really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. *[[satirical_social_commentary_in_south_park | South Park]]* must contend with the current political climate and the necessity of advertising, reflecting the complex interplay between media, economics, and social commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

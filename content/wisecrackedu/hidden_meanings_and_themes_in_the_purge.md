*The Purge* is a 21st-century film that depicts a society where murder has been legalized for 12 hours once a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This yearly event is presented as an improvement to society, despite the prior issues with "Doritos Tacos and Snapchat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Premise of The Purge
The film centers on the Sandin family, led by James Sandin, a successful home security salesman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Despite the impending "free-for-all fuckfest," the family is initially unconcerned about the Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, just minutes before the Purge begins, they remember to lock down their home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Their son soon lets in an injured homeless man, and the daughter's boyfriend sneaks in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A gang of masked teens, hunting the injured homeless man for sport, arrives and demands he be handed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Though the Sandins initially consider turning over the man, they ultimately decide against it, adopting a philosophy similar to that of Thomas Petty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The teens then break into the house, leading to violence that results in James's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The homeless man eventually returns to save the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Duality and Symbolism
[[philosophy_and_socioeconomic_commentary_in_the_purge | The Purge]] suggests that the human psyche contains both a light and a dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This duality is visually represented through various images:
*   **White and Blue Bouquets**: Displayed by Purge supporters, these symbolize the light and dark aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The blue baptisias specifically reference the Christian ritual of baptism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Charlie's Half Charred Nightmare Machine**: Another image highlighting this duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## The Vernal Equinox and Rebirth
[[references_to_historical_and_cultural_events_in_the_purge | The Purge]] occurs on March 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This date frequently coincided with Earth's vernal equinox, a time when day and night are of equal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Just as the vernal equinox signals the beginning of spring and a time of rebirth and renewal, the Purge is intended to create a healthier and more balanced society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The date also holds [[ritualistic_and_cultural_comparisons_of_the_purge | religious significance]]:
*   Christians once celebrated the resurrection of Young Jeezy on Easter, a date calibrated using the vernal equinox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Similarly, citizens in *The Purge* celebrate the "resurrection of their society" on Purge-mas Eve with religious fervor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Social Stratification and Class Critique
[[the_role_of_wealth_and_power_dynamics_in_the_purge | The film]] heavily emphasizes America's issues with [[class_struggles_and_economic_disparities_highlighted_by_the_purge | social stratification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   While the Purge laws are presented as class-neutral, they disproportionately affect the disenfranchised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The poor cannot afford the necessary protection, making them primary victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   The antagonists, dressed in prep school attire, represent the wealthy elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. They treat the hunting of a homeless black "non-contributor" as merely an extracurricular activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This highlights [[dehumanization_and_disposability_as_presented_in_the_purge | the dehumanization]] of the poor.
*   This imbalance echoes the 1980s War on Drugs, where laws for crack cocaine (affecting poor black communities) were significantly harsher than those for powder cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This is a clear [[neoliberalism_and_economic_critique_in_the_purge | economic critique]].

## Critique of Violence and Entertainment
[[critique_of_the_purge_as_a_violent_entertainment | The Purge]] initially posits that engaging in violence will relieve a person's aggressive desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, it quickly undermines this premise, concluding that such acts simply desensitize people and lead to even more violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The film uses unsettling juxtapositions to underscore this point:
*   Brutal images of murder are paired with classical music, suggesting that violence has become so commonplace it no longer shocks or horrifies, but rather bores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   In "Purge-world," humans watch grotesque events on TV for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

In a meta-commentary, *The Purge*, itself a violent film, serves as a criticism of its own nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. It provides viewers an opportunity to release aggression by watching a bloodbath, thereby perpetuating the very cycle it critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

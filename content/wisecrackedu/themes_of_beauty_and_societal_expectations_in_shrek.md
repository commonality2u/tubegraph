The animated film *Shrek*, the first winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, challenges traditional notions of beauty and societal expectations, particularly those pervasive in [[critique_of_disney_in_shrek | Disney's]] storytelling.

## Rejection of Idealized Appearances

*Shrek* actively undermines the idealistic perfection often found in [[comparison_of_shrek_and_traditional_fairy_tales | traditional fairy tales]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This is primarily conveyed through its central characters:

*   **Shrek's Unglamorous Persona**: As a "big green ogre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, Shrek is the antithesis of a "Prince Charming." His initial actions, such as wiping his backside with a fairy tale page and brushing his teeth with slime, are the opposite of the glamorous entrances typically given to "clenched-up Disney heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Fiona's Transformation**: Princess Fiona initially behaves like a stereotypical Disney princess, expecting a "prince charming" to sweep her off her feet with chivalry and grand gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. However, she is cursed to turn into an ogre every night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. When Shrek and Fiona kiss, breaking the curse, she remains an ogre "instead of a hot girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, challenging the expectation of transformation into a conventionally beautiful form.

## Critique of Superficiality and Outdated Ideals

The film's "anti-Disney agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> extends to its portrayal of characters and institutions that uphold superficial standards:

*   **Lord Facebook**: The character of Lord Facebook (purportedly based on Disney CEO Michael Eisner) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> embodies an "outdated conception of patriarchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He is depicted as "the most odious character in the film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> and represents the societal pressure for ideal beauty, recoiling in disgust when Fiona transforms into an ogre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. His kingdom, which is a "dead ringer for Disneyland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, symbolizes the commercialized and idealized world that *Shrek* aims to deconstruct.
*   **Challenging the "Happily Ever After"**: *Shrek* rejects the narrative that a "lovely princess and handsome hero live 'happily ever after'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. By making both Shrek and Fiona "ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> in the conventional sense, the film suggests their marriage might be "rocky, and probably end in divorce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, thereby offering a more realistic, albeit cynical, ending.

Dreamworks, under Jeffrey Katzenberg, used *Shrek* to criticize the notion that "the beautiful are destined for greater rewards than 'normal,' less valuable people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, advocating for the acceptance of imperfections and challenging the superficial beauty standards prevalent in media and society.

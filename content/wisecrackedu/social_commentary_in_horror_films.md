Director Ari Aster's 2018 film *Hereditary* left horror fans stunned, setting high expectations for his follow-up, *Midsommar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Contemporary horror filmmaker Jordan Peele lauded *Midsommar* as "the most idyllic horror film of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Given Peele's preference for horror films with a strong element of [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | social commentary]] and deep meaning, as seen in his films *Get Out* and *Us* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, *Midsommar* prompts the question of whether its "gnarly vision of the Swedish countryside" contains similar depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## *Midsommar*'s Blend of Reality and Fiction

*Midsommar* is not strictly anthropologically accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The Swedish Midsummer holiday is typically a "light and happy tradition" celebrating summer, fertility, and involves dancing, decorating with plants, and visiting holy springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. There is no historical evidence of human sacrifices on Midsummer, even in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The film's "weird sex stuff" was also "completely the twisted brainchild of Aster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, although baby-making is a significant part of the holiday, leading to many Swedes being born nine months after the summer solstice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While celebrating Swedes are more likely to drink alcohol than "trip balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, Aster did extensive research, drawing from Swedish traditions, folklore, and Norse mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Elements of truth incorporated into the film include:
*   Hårga being a real rural village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Much of the film's imagery, including a maypole, being consistent with real Swedish Midsummer celebrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Creepy barn paintings reflecting real agrarian Swedish societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   People eating herring and wearing flower wreaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Religious traditions like the blessing of crops, inspired by James George Fraser's 19th-century anthropological study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Aster also learned the Scandinavian runic alphabet, using specifically chosen runic symbols and an invented hieroglyphic language for the Hårga clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Examples include:
*   Christian's robe with the Tiwaz symbol, associated with the Nordic god Tyr, representing bravery and virility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   Dany's dress featuring the Rivo rune (journey) and Thagauz rune (new beginning or loss of hope), reflecting her character's duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

The film's death rituals, such as the sacrifice of humans every nine years, are likely inspired by long-debated Viking mythology and folklore, though scholars dispute their occurrence, especially after 1050 A.D. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Other moments infused with Norse mythology include:
*   Christian being placed in a bear carcass before burning, as bears are significant in Norse mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   Simon's fate, splayed open with lungs still breathing, which is a reenactment of the "blood eagle," a Viking torture ritual documented in 865 A.D. but of debated possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Hårga love rituals also borrow from reality; young women pick seven different flowers to place under their pillow to dream of their future mate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. However, some elements like Maya placing a carved love rune under Christian's bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, a pubic hair in pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, and menstrual blood in a drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, are attributed to "actual Swedish folklore" by Aster, though their veracity is harder to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

This combination of truth and fiction, history and mythology, creates a "creepy haven of cell phone-free agrarian life" where ritualized human sacrifice is normalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Social Commentary Through Character Arcs

*Midsommar* uses its characters' reactions to the Hårga rituals to provide [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | social commentary]] on modern society.

### Dany's Transformation: Finding Community in Ritual

Dany begins the film in a "cold, alienating secular society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. After losing her family, she receives little comfort, and her boyfriend Christian stays with her out of guilt rather than genuine care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Her world lacks community and emotional support, highlighted by her isolation and superficial phone interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Christian constantly tries to distance himself, forgets her birthday, and pressures her to take hallucinogens despite her panic attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The Hårga, by contrast, offer the love, empathy, and community Dany craves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

> "I have always felt held by a family, a real family, which everyone deserves. You deserve [it]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

The Hårga exhibit a profound sense of unity, moving "in tandem as if they're all dancing to the same piece of choreography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This "shared catharsis" in both pain and pleasure is a recurring theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>:
*   When an old man survives a cliff jump, the tribe moans in collective pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   During Christian's sex ritual, women moan in unison with Maya, sharing her pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Aster describes their language as "empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Dany, initially intimidated, becomes increasingly immersed in the Hårga culture. Her transformation is visually represented by her changing costume, from dark "real world clothing" to traditional Hårga attire and eventually a flower wreath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Her participation in the maypole dance, fueled by hallucinogens, marks the first time she genuinely smiles, signifying her integration into the Hårga's "singular organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

The pivotal moment occurs after Dany witnesses Christian's infidelity; Hårga women cry in tandem with her, "sharing her emotional load and completely empathizing with her pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This collective empathy is a stark contrast to her previous isolation. Dany's assimilation is also mirrored by her increasing immersion in nature, culminating in her becoming "covered with more and more flowers" and eventually "disappeared into a gown and crown of bright blossoms," symbolizing her surrender to this agrarian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Her ultimate act of choosing Christian for sacrifice, and her subsequent smile as he burns, signifies her freedom from her former life and her belonging in a community that sees and accepts her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### The Bros' Detachment: A Critique of Secular Aversion to Ritual

In contrast to Dany's journey, Christian and his "dude bros" approach the Hårga with a "condescending distance," like anthropology students studying a subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. They sneak into temples for photos and observe rituals as if watching animals in a zoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Mark, one of the bros, exemplifies this detachment and disrespect by urinating on a sacred tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

This detached and shocked reaction mirrors the audience's own "modern secular aversion to mystical traditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The film's choice of "very religious Swedes" as the "boogeyman" rather than a typical serial killer reflects society's fear and aversion to ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## The Value of Ritual

Ultimately, *Midsommar* is a "shocking reassertion of the value of ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Despite the seemingly irrational nature of the Hårga's acts, they serve a "very rational purpose: to build community and a sense of belonging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. By depicting the Hårga as the solution to the problems in Dany's life—offering "complete acceptance, genuine reciprocity, and total empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>—Aster uses the film to comment on contemporary society's increasing secularism and its potential for isolation. The film argues that these rituals, however unsettling, provide a communal structure that modern society often lacks.

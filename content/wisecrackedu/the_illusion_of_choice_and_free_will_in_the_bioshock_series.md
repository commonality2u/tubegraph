From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

The *Bioshock* trilogy is recognized for its profound [[integration_of_philosophical_concepts_in_bioshock | integration of philosophical concepts]] into its narrative and gameplay, particularly its exploration of [[themes_of_fate_and_free_will | themes of freedom and choice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While many games possess philosophical undertones, *Bioshock* stands out for its intellectual sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A central dilemma posed throughout the series is the question of [[determinism_and_free_will | determinism and free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Andrew Ryan's Dictum: "A Man Chooses. A Slave Obeys."

In the first *Bioshock* game, the character of Andrew Ryan, an anagram for [[ayn_rands_objectivism_and_its_influence_on_bioshock | Ayn Rand]] and a proponent of her Objectivist philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, challenges the player's perceived agency with the statement: "A man chooses. A slave obeys." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> This phrase highlights a core tension: if individuals make choices, they must be free; yet, if choices define individuals, it raises questions about the true [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_morty | freedom]] to make them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Hard Determinism in Gaming

The game directly engages with the philosophical school of "Hard Determinism," which posits that [[determinism_and_free_will | free will]] does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. According to this view, all actions are reducible to cause and effect, meaning human choices are always dictated by external forces, rather than genuine autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The game suggests that what players perceive as "choice" is merely an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Gaming's Fixed Path

Andrew Ryan's philosophical monologues in *Bioshock* serve as a commentary on the nature of gaming itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. He implies that players are destined to mindlessly follow the fixed narrative path dictated by the game's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The notion of "interactivity," or the idea that a player's actions genuinely influence the game's outcome, is presented as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## The Multiverse and the Illusion of Choice in *Bioshock Infinite*

*Bioshock Infinite* initially appears to offer a potential escape from the problem of [[determinism_and_free_will | free will]] through its concept of the multiverse, suggesting an infinite number of worlds and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The protagonist, Booker DeWitt, seemingly has the opportunity to alter past events, such as choosing not to be baptized or even preventing the birth of Comstock, his alternate self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:11:01]</a>.

However, the game quickly reveals that even these apparent choices are not genuine possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. *Infinite* subtly reinforces the argument that player choice is an illusion, even when the game presents options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Examples of Forced "Choices"

*   **The Coin Flip**: Early in the game, Booker is prompted to "choose" to flip a coin by pressing a button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:23]</a>. However, the player is not truly free to *not* flip the coin, as the game will not progress otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:33]</a>. Furthermore, every coin flip consistently results in "heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Handing Over Elizabeth**: Another key scene involves Booker being presented with the "choice" to "Bring [them] the girl and wipe away the debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:42]</a>. While the player can walk around the room and even see an "X" option to hand Elizabeth over, the only way to advance the narrative is to press "square" and pick her up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:52]</a>. This sequence, where the player is compelled to perform a specific action despite seemingly having other "options," directly illustrates that the "choice" is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:04]</a>. The player is fated to follow the predetermined path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:11]</a>.

By making the player actively press a button for these predetermined events, *Bioshock* forces an acknowledgment of the lack of [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_morty | freedom]] within its narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:23]</a>. The ultimate assertion of one's [[themes_of_freedom_and_choice_in_rick_and_ Morty | freedom]] within the *Bioshock* universe, it suggests, is to simply turn off the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:30]</a>. This meta-commentary on player agency underscores the series' central philosophical inquiry into [[choice_and_determinism_in_the_matrix | choice and determinism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:09]</a>.

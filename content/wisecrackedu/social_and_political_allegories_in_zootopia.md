*Zootopia* is presented as an artifact from Earth's 24th century, a time after humans have become extinct and animals have inherited their wardrobes and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The film's narrative, centered on Judy Hopps, a rabbit who becomes a police officer, delves into complex social and political themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Central Themes: Nature vs. Nurture and Prejudice

At its core, *Zootopia* explores the [[nature_versus_nurture_debate_in_zootopia | nature vs. nurture debate]], questioning whether identity is biologically predetermined or can be shaped by environment and societal influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Initially, the film suggests that a "veneer of civilization" is the only thing preventing predators from reverting to their wild instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

This theme is exemplified by Nick Wilde, a fox who publicly defies negative stereotypes associated with his species but privately exhibits a "sly nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. When predators begin to regress to primitive behaviors, proponents of biological determinism feel vindicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. However, it is later revealed that this regression is caused by an "obscure poison" from a flower called "night howlers," leading the animals to realize that biology is not inherently to blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

The film actively illustrates the fallacy of relying on [[use_of_stereotypes_and_prejudice_in_zootopia | prejudice]] by inverting established stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   Judy's childhood fox bully becomes a pacifist pastry chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Flash, a sloth known for being slow, is depicted as a speed demon drag racer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   The "dumb bunny" Judy solves the case, while the "sly fox" Nick obtains an honest job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   The meek lamb assistant mayor is revealed to be the ruthless mastermind behind the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Social and Political Parallels

*Zootopia* mirrors the social and political landscape of 20th-century America, particularly efforts to address societal inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The film's "Mammal Inclusion Initiative" parallels Earthling diversity and affirmative action programs designed to level the playing field for underserved minorities, and in the case of women, majorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The use of language associated with "PC movement" further accentuates these parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For example, Judy Hopps declares, "Sir, I'm not just some token bunny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Critiques of Social Inclusion

The film suggests that "citizens of Zootopia are able to fix all their social ills just by trying hard and being optimistic," echoing a simplistic view of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Despite its themes of inclusion, the film is critiqued for its limited scope, as peace and tranquility are achieved for the "entire animal kingdom," but exclude reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and insects, implying their demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The film is noted for "go[ing] out of their way to ignore all the freaks and uggos" for a movie about inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Hamlet*, by William Shakespeare, is set in the kingdom of Elsinore, which is in turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The play centers on Prince Hamlet, who is deeply distressed by the swift marriage of his uncle, Claudius, to his mother, Queen Gertrude, shortly after the death of his father, the Old King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Plot Synopsis

### The Ghost's Revelation
The situation escalates when guards witness the ghost of the Old King near the castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. They inform Hamlet, who then encounters his father's ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The ghost reveals that Claudius murdered him to usurp the throne, specifically by pouring poison into his ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The ghost charges Hamlet with the task of avenging his death by killing Claudius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Ophelia and Polonius's Warnings
Meanwhile, Hamlet's love interest, Ophelia, receives warnings from her father, Polonius, and her brother, Laertes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They caution her to avoid Hamlet, fearing he might take advantage of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Ophelia heeds their advice and ignores Hamlet's affections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Hamlet's subsequent erratic behavior, stemming from his contemplation of killing Claudius, is mistakenly attributed by others to lovesickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### The Play-Within-A-Play
To confirm the ghost's story, Hamlet devises a plan to stage a play that reenacts the Old King's murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. When Claudius observes the murder scene on stage, he reacts strongly, fleeing the performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This reaction convinces Hamlet that the ghost's account is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Polonius's Death
Later, during a heated confrontation with his mother, Gertrude, Hamlet questions her disrespect towards the King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Polonius, hiding behind a curtain and eavesdropping, cries out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Believing it to be Claudius, Hamlet stabs Polonius through the curtain, killing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Escalation and The Final Duel
Polonius's death ignites Laertes's rage and causes Ophelia to descend into madness, leading to her drowning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Claudius, seeing an opportunity, conspires with Laertes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Their plan is for Laertes to challenge Hamlet to a duel using a sword tipped with poison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. As a backup, Claudius intends to poison Hamlet's wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

During the duel between Hamlet and Laertes, Queen Gertrude accidentally drinks the poisoned wine intended for Hamlet and dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Both Laertes and Hamlet are wounded by the poisoned blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Before dying, Laertes reveals Claudius's treachery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Enraged, Hamlet stabs Claudius and forces him to drink the remaining poisoned wine, thus avenging his father's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. With the entire royal family deceased, the kingdom is passed to Fortinbras, a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Major Themes and Interpretations

### [[hamlets_procrastination_and_motivations | Hamlet's Procrastination]] and Motivation
A central and highly debated aspect of *Hamlet* is the protagonist's consistent delay in carrying out his revenge against Claudius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Various interpretations attempt to explain this [[hamlets_procrastination_and_motivations | procrastination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>:
*   Some scholars suggest Hamlet is too sensitive to act violently in a corrupt world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Others propose he suffers from an Oedipal Complex, making him reluctant to kill Claudius, who has enacted Hamlet's own subconscious desires (killing his father and being with his mother) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   A third perspective is that Hamlet intentionally delays to challenge the corrupt kingdom built on lies and treachery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Imagery of Corruption
Shakespeare frequently employs imagery of skin disease and corruption throughout the play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Examples include Hamlet describing his mother's body and soul with "ulcerous places" and "blisters" in Act 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, and the gravediggers discussing "pocky corpses" in Act 5, Scene 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This recurring motif highlights that beneath an outward appearance of righteousness, the characters and the kingdom are plagued by ruin and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | Ambiguity and Uncertainty]]
The play is also notable for capturing the [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | ambiguity of modernity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Like the modern individual, Hamlet lacks a clear moral code and is troubled by his divided mind and will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. He grapples with ethical and metaphysical [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

This [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainty]] is prominently featured in Hamlet's famous "To be or not to be" soliloquy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Interpretations of this speech vary:
*   Some believe it reflects Hamlet's indecision between living and dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   Others argue it represents a choice between Christian self-denial and the violent action required to reclaim his throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

The play extends this [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainty]] to the audience, casting them as "characters of uncertainty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Key questions remain ambiguous throughout the play, such as the trustworthiness of Hamlet's ghost father, Gertrude's complicity, why the ghost is seen by everyone in Act 1 but only Hamlet in Act 3, and whether Hamlet's madness is feigned or genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Ultimately, Shakespeare presents all individuals as facing similar [[existentialism_and_uncertainty_in_hamlet | uncertainties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

The play *Hamlet*, by William Shakespeare, unfolds in the kingdom of Elsinore, where chaos has erupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Following the death of the old King, his brother Claudius marries Queen Gertrude, the King's widow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Queen Gertrude's son, Hamlet, is deeply disturbed by his mother's swift remarriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Plot Synopsis

The plot thickens when guards witness the ghost of the old King near the castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. They inform Hamlet, who then confronts the ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The ghost reveals that Claudius murdered him to seize the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The ghost instructs Hamlet to seek revenge against Claudius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Meanwhile, Ophelia, Hamlet's love interest, is warned by her father Polonius and brother Laertes to distance herself from Hamlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Ophelia heeds their advice, ignoring Hamlet's advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Hamlet's distraught behavior, stemming from the ghost's revelation and the task of avenging his father, is misinterpreted by others as love-sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

To confirm Claudius's guilt, Hamlet stages a play that re-enacts his father's murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. When Claudius sees the reenactment, he flees the performance, confirming his culpability to Hamlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Later, during a heated discussion between Hamlet and his mother, Gertrude, Polonius, who is hiding and listening, screams out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Believing it to be Claudius, Hamlet fatally stabs Polonius through the curtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Polonius's death infuriates Laertes, his son, and causes Ophelia to descend into madness, ultimately leading to her drowning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Claudius then conspires with Laertes, devising a plan for Laertes to challenge Hamlet to a duel with a poisoned sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. As a backup, Claudius prepares poisoned wine for Hamlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

During the duel, Queen Gertrude accidentally drinks the poisoned wine intended for Hamlet and dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Both Laertes and Hamlet wound each other with the poisoned blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Before dying, Laertes confesses Claudius's plot to Hamlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In his final moments, Hamlet stabs Claudius and forces him to drink the remaining poisoned wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. With the entire royal family dead, the kingdom is passed to Fortinbras, a soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### [[hamlets_procrastination_and_internal_conflict | Hamlet's Procrastination]]
A central point of debate in *Hamlet* is the protagonist's repeated delay in avenging his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Several theories attempt to explain [[hamlets_procrastination_and_internal_conflict | Hamlet's procrastination]]:
*   **Sensitivity:** Some argue Hamlet is too sensitive to act in a "gangster" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Oedipal Complex:** Others suggest an Oedipal complex, where Hamlet cannot kill Claudius because Claudius has fulfilled Hamlet's own unconscious desire to kill his father and be with his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Systemic Rebellion:** A third perspective posits that Hamlet is trying to dismantle a corrupt and deceitful kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## [[themes_of_corruption_and_treachery_in_hamlet | Themes and Interpretations]]

### [[themes_of_corruption_and_treachery_in_hamlet | Corruption and Disease]]
Shakespeare frequently uses imagery of skin disease throughout the play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For example, Hamlet refers to the body and soul's "ulcerous places" and "blisters," and gravediggers mention "pocky corpses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This pervasive imagery suggests that beneath a facade of righteousness, ruin and corruption exist within the characters and the kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Ambiguity and Modernity
The play reflects the ambiguity of modernity, with Hamlet embodying the modern man who lacks a clear moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. His "divided mind and will" are a source of conflict and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

This uncertainty is evident in Hamlet's famous "to be or not to be" speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Interpretations of this speech vary:
*   **Life or Death:** Some believe it questions whether to live or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Self-Denial or Revenge:** Others argue it's a choice between Christian self-denial and seeking violent revenge to reclaim his throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

The play deliberately presents numerous unanswered questions, casting the audience as "characters of uncertainty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Such questions include:
*   Can the ghost be trusted? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   Was Gertrude involved in the plot? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Why can everyone see the ghost in Act 1, but only Hamlet sees it in Act 3? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Is Hamlet merely pretending to be crazy, or has his feigned madness become real? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

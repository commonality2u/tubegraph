Quentin Tarantino's films are often recognized for their stylistic hallmarks, such as John Travolta's legendary comeback in a stylish wig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, BJ Novak hunting Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, or Samuel L. Jackson's explicit language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, *Django Unchained* offers a comprehensive subversion of the logic of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, providing a clever and nuanced criticism of the institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Film Overview
*Django Unchained* tells the story of Django, a captured runaway slave who is rescued by King Schultz, a German bounty hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Schultz teaches Django his craft, and they eventually embark on a mission to rescue Django's wife, Broomhilde, from the vile plantation owner Calvin Candie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While the film delivers on "revenge porn about a former slave burning down a Southern plantation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, it also provides three subtle commentaries on slavery beneath its classic Tarantino-isms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_language_and_culture_in_django_unchained | Language and Culture: You Can’t Cover Ugly with Civilization]]
*Django Unchained* utilizes language for more than just expletives, offering a purposeful commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. From the perspective of white enslavers like Big Daddy and Calvin Candie, white bodies symbolize culture and civilization, while black bodies are perceived as uncivilized and incapable of proper language or cultural appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Linguistic Disruption
King Schultz, an eloquent German who speaks English as a second language, confounds native-speaking enslavers with his mastery of vocabulary and rhetorical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. His linguistic prowess makes the self-satisfied Southerners appear "wildly uncivilized by comparison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, serving as a walking reminder that these "self styled men of culture are... full of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

This commentary on language directly challenges the historical justification for slavery, which dates back to Aristotle. Aristotle differentiated humans from animals through "logos" (speech and reason), while animals communicated only through "phonos" (base instincts like yapping and barking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. He used this concept to justify slavery in Greece, asserting that slaves could only receive and understand "logos" but not possess it, implying they lacked proper speech and reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. *Django Unchained* flips this dichotomy by portraying some of the cruelest enslavers as incoherent, while the enslaved characters are clearly intelligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Symbolic Etiquette and Shared Humanity
The film consistently contrasts Schultz's treatment of enslaved people with that of other white characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Schultz uses the honorific "Fraulein" when addressing Broomhilde, unlike the N-word used by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. In contrast, Candie demands the French honorific "Monsieur" as a sign of mandatory submission, despite not speaking French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

A similar dynamic is observed with the symbolism of beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Early on, Schultz buys Django a beer, symbolizing their transition from a master-slave relationship to that of coworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. However, Candie later offers a beer to one of his fighters as a "sick sort of reward" for literally murdering another man for the enslavers' enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. One instance represents shared humanity, while the other signifies cold-blooded savagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### The Faux-Civilized and Religious Hypocrisy
Even Schultz, the multilingual European, is not entirely "civilized" as a bounty hunter who kills people for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. He buys Django out of self-interest and forces him into assistance, though he at least acknowledges the pragmatic, not moral, nature of his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

The peak of this contrast is seen with Calvin Candie, who demands the title "Monsieur" despite his ignorance of French and inappropriate conduct, such as having an attraction to his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Schultz eventually reaches his breaking point when Candie's household appropriates Beethoven, a product of Schultz's culture, leading him to confront the "truly savages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The film also addresses how the Christian Bible was used to justify slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. During Django's first bounty job, a Brittle brother quotes Genesis 9:2—a verse about God giving mankind power over beasts—while preparing to whip a slave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Django then shoots the Brittle brother through a page of the Bible pinned over his heart, highlighting the "bloody hypocrisy of using Christianity to justify savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This verse served as a justification for slavery by depicting enslaved people as "less than human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## [[symbolic_subversion_and_cultural_appropriation_in_django_unchained | Symbolic Subversion: Using the Symbols of Slavery to Make Slavery Look Stupid]]
Beyond language and culture, *Django Unchained* employs fashion, music, and iconography to subvert the logic of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Fashion as Disidentification
The film's use of fashion can be understood by considering Joseph Cinque, leader of the Amistad Rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Cinque, who led illegally purchased slaves to take control of the Amistad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, was often portrayed in media in the style of a noble from the culture that enslaved him, a depiction described as "egalitarian" and "subversive" by historian Marcus Rediker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Similarly, when Schultz gives Django a makeover, Django emerges dressed like one of the Three Musketeers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This attire, along with Django's horseback riding—an activity historically associated with the well-to-do—is deliberately abrasive to those who would reserve such outfits and activities for white, civilized men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. In a final act, Django wears Candie’s clothes while enacting his revenge, blowing up the plantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Django's aesthetic choices align with José Esteban Muñoz’s concept of "disidentification," a strategy of acting against a dominant ideology not by escaping or assimilating, but by "mangl[ing] its symbols from within" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Django's appropriation of Southern aristocrat attire serves to "abuse the very notion of the Southern Gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This is comparable to artist Kehinde Wiley's work, where Harlem residents are painted in the style of classic European art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Music as Subversion
Tarantino manipulates the soundtrack to emphasize Django's subversion of cultural expectations, notably by incorporating rap music, which seems anachronistic for a mid-19th century Western <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. However, rap music has historically been a tool for those facing racial and economic inequality to "fight the powers that be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, particularly against systemic white supremacy rooted in American slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The film's song "100 Black Coffins" by Rick Ross and Jamie Foxx, with lyrics like "Our revenge is the sweetest, bitch cause I'm coming / Gonna die in my arms, for what you did to my mother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, perfectly highlights Django's journey of seeking power and revenge under oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Music is also used by Schultz to contextualize Django’s quest through Richard Wagner’s "Twilight of the Gods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Schultz interprets Django's rescue mission as akin to Siegfried's story of revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Drawing on Friedrich Nietzsche, Wagner's Siegfried can be seen as a Nietzschean ubermensch, one who creates new values in response to a nihilistic lack of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. If Django is this ubermensch, he confronts the nihilistic values of slavery and white supremacy not through dialogue or reform, but by "metaphorically and literally burning the whole damn thing to the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, symbolizing the destruction of the institution of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Furthermore, Tarantino, having made [[the_role_of_film_in_inglourious_basterds | *Inglourious Basterds*]], is likely aware that Wagner's Ring Cycle became a soundtrack for German nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The film thus uses a narrative appropriated by the Nazis to support white supremacy and turns it into a slavery revenge narrative that destroys white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Finally, Tarantino uses the Western genre, typically featuring "strong jawed white dudes" killing Native Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, to frame this slave revenge fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. In *Django Unchained*, white cowboy types are instead eliminated by a freed slave, a subject largely ignored in the Western canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## [[agency_and_acting_as_forms_of_resistance_in_django_unchained | Acting Out of Slavery: Agency and Acting]]
The film explores the role of acting as a primary means for Django to exert agency within the confines of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Academic debates surrounding agency in slavery often question whether enslaved individuals completely lacked autonomy or found ways to exert freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Historical examples of resistance include work slowdowns, arson, and murder, though retaliation for such acts was horrific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Django's Performed Agency
Schultz prepares Django to "play a character" with a specific wardrobe during their mission to trick Candie and rescue Broomhilde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Django's agency is expressed through his decisions within this role, such as berating other slaves, lashing out at Candie's crew, and even passively witnessing a runaway slave being torn apart by dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. These decisions are presented as necessary for his survival within his limited agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

Later, Django's acting skills enable him to outsmart a gang of Australians to regain his freedom and complete his mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. He delivers a convincing performance, using props like a handbill, which leads the Australians to hand him a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### Stephen's Performance
Perhaps the most striking example of agency through acting is Stephen, Candie’s head house slave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Stephen's hatred for Django likely stems from envy, as Stephen achieved power within the system of slavery through his efforts, while Django gained freedom by breaking out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Stephen has "performed his way" out of harsh field labor into the relative comfort of Candie's home, gaining enough influence to even disagree with his master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. He uses performed laughter at Candie's jokes to build trust and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This influence is evident when Stephen, not Candie, discerns Schultz and Django's true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Stephen also employs non-verbal acting, faking a limp and using a cane to appear physically weak, disarming suspicions about his capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

While Stephen is depicted as a villain who serves his white master's interests over those of fellow slaves, his villainy is framed within the context of his limited choices under slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. He manifested his own power with the cards he was dealt, lacking the "luxury of a fake German dentist showing up to free him and teach him how to shoot his way to freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Conclusion
*Django Unchained*, often dismissed as an irreverent Western, is in fact "one of the sharpest criticisms of slavery, and of white supremacy, in recent cinema" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

In its thirteenth season, *[[south_parks_satire_on_religion_and_consumerism | South Park]]* masterfully merged religion and consumerism for ridicule in the episode "Margaritaville" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This episode uses clever [[religious_allegory_and_the_economy_in_margaritaville | religious allegory]] to tackle the 2008 economic crash and the often-unexplainable nature of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Randy Marsh's Economic Theology

When the "Economy" leaves South Park in disarray, Randy Marsh's bizarre perspective gains a significant following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Taking cues from old-school Protestant ethics, Randy preaches that the economy is a "petty, vengeful deity" that requires placation through worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. His stance draws from the fearful, punishment-oriented philosophies often associated with the Old Testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Biblical Parallels and Persecution

The episode directly incorporates biblical parallels, including the flinging of "stones" (represented by squirrels) at those deemed fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Randy's persecution of Kyle, who later becomes a Christ-like figure, mimics the biblical role of the Pharisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The Pharisees, in the New Testament, were known for their skepticism, paranoia, and incitement of violence against Jesus's message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Connection to Max Weber's Protestant Ethic

Randy's unforgiving message of self-discipline and self-denial closely aligns with the ethics described by German sociologist Max Weber in "The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Weber argued that Protestant values emphasizing austerity and frugality were crucial for the development of modern capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Randy's philosophy can be summarized as "work until you die, and don't make any time for any fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Kyle's consumer-driven economic philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

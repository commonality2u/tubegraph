In [[The Dark Knight]], the character known as the Joker is an "unemployed clown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> who actively seeks to interact with "Bat-man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He orchestrates a trap involving District Attorney Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Duality of Order vs. Chaos

The film explores the duality of order versus chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The Joker's primary objective is to reveal to the citizens of Gotham that beneath the superficial appearance of an orderly society lies existential anarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Nihilistic Beliefs

The Joker is characterized as a nihilist, someone who "believes in nothing, not even the concept of nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. When confronted with the question, "WHAT DO YOU ALL BELIEVE IN?!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, his response is considered meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. He famously states, "Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you stranger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Even a grenade he presents is depicted as an empty scare tactic, emitting only a floral perfume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The various stories he provides about the origins of his scars are all lies, emphasizing that the "doesn't matter how he got the scars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The Joker's tendency to joke stems from his belief that "everything is trivial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Morality as a Sham

Despite the seemingly random nature of his acts, the Joker's terrorist actions are not arbitrary; they aim to prove a central point: "morality is a sham" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. He contends that if humans are stripped of their "physical comforts or safety," they will revert to "wild animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. His approach involves exploiting the "innate, base lawlessness of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, dismissing societal rules with the phrase, "Their code, it's a bad joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Examples of his methods include:
*   Inciting bank robbers to kill each other for a larger share of loot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Providing "friends" with a weapon and demanding they fight for a spot on his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Threatening to bomb hospitals, leading to corruption among police and citizens attempting murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Corruption of Harvey Dent

The Joker's ultimate achievement, his "pièce de résistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, is the corruption of District Attorney Harvey Dent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Dent's double-sided coin initially symbolizes his unwavering commitment to "justice, morality, and order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, after Dent transforms into Two-Face, the coin becomes scarred on one side, making it a "regular coin: 50/50" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This transformation signifies that Dent has been "infected by the Joker's vision – a reality ruled only by cosmic anarchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The Joker's philosophy is encapsulated by his statement to Dent: "The only morality in a cruel world is chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

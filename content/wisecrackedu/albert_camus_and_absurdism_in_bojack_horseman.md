The animated series *BoJack Horseman* presents itself with colorful animation, talking animals, and Hollywood glamour, but beneath this lighthearted veneer lies a dark and often depressing reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The show focuses on the disillusionment that arises when one looks beneath the surface of [[Hollywoo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Hollywoo as a Metaphor for Existence

[[Hollywoo]] itself can be seen as a metaphor for existence, where its dazzling fa√ßade hides an ugly, narcissistic reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This extends to the broader world, where the "trappings of our daily lives" often conceal the inherent meaninglessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This central idea, known as [[existential_nihilism_and_bojack_horseman | Existential Nihilism]], is foundational to *BoJack Horseman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The show then explores how one might cope with a life devoid of inherent meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Distraction as a Coping Mechanism

A primary way characters in *BoJack Horseman* cope with the anguish of a meaningless world is through distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

*   **Princess Carolyn** persistently distracts herself with her demanding job and her compulsive need to fix the lives of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. She struggles with free time, quickly finding a way back into the [[Hollywoo]] grindstone even after her agency folds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Todd** is happy as long as he has "something to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Without tasks, he spirals into [[distraction_as_a_coping_mechanism_in_bojack_horseman | existential despair]], constantly keeping himself busy with various ambitious, often nonsensical, projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Mr. Peanutbutter** lives in a constant state of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Despite appearing foolish, he is surprisingly self-aware, stating that "the key to being happy isn't the search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense. And eventually... you'll be dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **BoJack** himself lives a life defined by trivial distractions, often forgetting how he spends his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. He has drifted through life in a near-constant state of distraction since his show "Horsin' Around" ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

This concept of distraction is echoed in the philosophy of 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal, a precursor to the Existentialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Pascal believed that humans, when left to think too much, will inevitably contemplate their own insignificance, leading to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Distraction acts as a psychological defense mechanism, allowing people to remain functional, if not happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. BoJack, like Pascal's kings, has no serious struggle to occupy his life, relying on constant distraction to avoid confronting his reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

However, this "charade" collapses for BoJack when he reads Diane's book, "One Trick Pony," which forces him to confront his self-deception and the truth about himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. With the illusion of distraction broken, and with no "God" to turn to in [[Hollywoo]]'s "post-God-Is-Dead world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>, BoJack's attempts to force distraction again end tragically, as seen with Secretariat's advice to "Don't Think About It" and the fatal bender with Sarah Lynn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

## Radical Freedom

While the core focus is on Absurdism, *BoJack Horseman* also touches upon Jean-Paul Sartre's concept of [[existentialism_and_radical_freedom_in_bojack_horseman | Radical Freedom]], a major focus of [[rick_and_morty_and_existentialism | Existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Sartre's "Existence Precedes Essence" means that humans, unlike manufactured objects, are not created with a pre-defined purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. There is "nothing stopping BoJack from stealing the D from the Hollywood sign, or doing three months worth of drugs, and on the flip side nothing forcing him to do those things either" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. This means BoJack has total control over his choices and is "responsible for EVERYTHING he does" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. As Diane states, "all you are is just the things that you do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. This grim realization, however, offers hope: BoJack is not doomed to be the person he has been, but has the freedom to change his actions and himself, though it is entirely up to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

## Embrace The Absurd

The paths to happiness for characters like Mr. Peanutbutter and Cuddly Whiskers, achieved after or because of the realization of nihilism, directly invoke 20th-century French thinker Albert Camus and his philosophy of Absurdism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

For Camus, the universe is irrational and meaningless, yet humans desperately seek reason and meaning within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. This fundamental discrepancy is what Camus called "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. Upon becoming aware of The Absurd, Camus proposed three choices:
1.  Return to the cycle of daily life and don't think about it (a form of distraction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
2.  Commit suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
3.  Rebellion: Accept the absurd and choose to be happy anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

Mr. Peanutbutter, after his brother's illness, realizes that "None of this matters!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. Similarly, Cuddly Whiskers, BoJack's old writing partner, finds happiness only after abandoning his [[Hollywoo]] life, proclaiming, "An Oscar is meaningless. It's all meaningless. Only after you give up everything can you begin to find a way to be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. These characters exemplify Camus's preferred option of rebellion.

Camus illustrates these ideas in his essay, *The Myth of Sisyphus*, which tells the story of a man condemned to eternally push a rock up a hill, only for it to roll back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. Sisyphus becomes Camus's "Absurd Hero" when he recognizes the futility of his task but chooses to find happiness despite it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

*BoJack Horseman* directly references *The Myth of Sisyphus*:
*   Princess Carolyn describes her struggles as having to "push a boulder up a hill and then have it roll over me time and time again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
*   A recurring symbol is the Baboon jogging up the same hill outside BoJack's house each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. He tells BoJack, "It gets easier. Everyday it gets a little easier. Butcha gotta do it everyday. That's the hard part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. This dialogue encapsulates the perseverance required to embrace the absurd.

At the end of Season 3, BoJack confronts the meaningless loop of his life when he sees a young actress aspiring to be "like him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. As Camus describes, "the stage set collapses," leading to "suicide or recovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. BoJack flees, driving aimlessly, a form of his old "run and don't look back" coping mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. However, when he releases the steering wheel, he appears to submit to the Absurd and to suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. Yet, seeing the Wild Horses offers an alternative: they represent the "Absurd Hero," a group of horses running purely for its own sake, embracing the meaningless task and finding happiness anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. This moment suggests BoJack might be ready to follow Cuddly Whiskers' advice and begin to find happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Quest for Meaning

While Absurdism offers a path, the show also hints at [[the_concept_of_family_in_bojack_horseman | family]] as another possible solution to BoJack's struggle for meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. BoJack often watches "Horsin' Around" scenes that revolve around the in-show family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>, and during a bender, he envisions himself as a simple family man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. His attempt to sleep with Penny highlights his desperate desire for a domestic life he could have had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. The Wild Horses, beyond being Absurd Heroes, could also symbolize "the herd" and the sense of belonging BoJack lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. However, even with the possibility of exploring this theme further, the show suggests that even family might not be enough to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

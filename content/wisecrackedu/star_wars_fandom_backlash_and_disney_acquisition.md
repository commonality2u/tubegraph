Since Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, the *Star Wars* franchise has experienced significant fan backlash, particularly following *The Last Jedi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Some fans have issued anti-Disney manifestos, crowdfunded for a remake, and claimed credit for *Solo*'s box office failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Rumors even suggested Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy might retire early, potentially influenced by social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This phenomenon suggests a deeper issue beyond typical fan grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Nature of the Backlash

Much of the fan anger stems from director Rian Johnson's overt attempt to "kill the past" and [[Rian Johnsons attempt to revolutionize the Star Wars franchise | subvert the canon]] in *The Last Jedi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Specific points of contention include:

*   **Rey's Parentage** Instead of being a Skywalker or Kenobi, Rey was revealed to be from "nobodies," despite earlier teasing in *The Force Awakens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **Snoke's Demise** Supreme Leader Snoke suffered an unceremonious death with no backstory or grand reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Luke Skywalker's Portrayal** Fans were dismayed to see Luke, a hero who once saw light in Darth Vader, throwing his lightsaber off a cliff and nearly killing his nephew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

These creative decisions, coupled with new *Star Wars* spinoffs receiving universal panning, have led to a perceived crisis in the franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## A Legitimation Crisis

The situation in *Star Wars* parallels what political philosopher Jurgen Habermas describes as a "legitimation crisis" – an existential crisis threatening the foundation of a social system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Social systems comprise governmental, socio-cultural, and economic sub-parts, all of which interact and can be mapped onto the *Star Wars* fandom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Governmental Legitimacy

Governments derive legitimacy from various sources: monarchies from divine right, democracies from popular election, and constitutional governments from their founding documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Economic stability also contributes to legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. When people feel a system no longer upholds its values or has betrayed them, they may rebel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

For *Star Wars*, George Lucas was likened to a "divinely ordained monarch" of the universe, with his six films and Lucasfilm-approved spin-offs forming its constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. His legitimacy stemmed from his role as creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### The Socio-Cultural "Lifeworld"

Together with Lucas, fans helped create a fully functioning "lifeworld" (lebenswelt) for *Star Wars*, characterized by shared practices, beliefs, values, and rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. The general meaning, values, characters, stories, and themes of *Star Wars* were originally laid out by Lucas and generally agreed upon within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Lucas's word was essentially *Star Wars* law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. This universe also helped create individual identity for fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### Disney's "Regime Change"

In 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm, leading to a "regime change" where "Lord Lucas was replaced by a money-hungry animated mouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Disney's controversial decisions after gaining rights to *Star Wars* intellectual property plunged the franchise into a legitimation crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

## Historical Parallel: The Catholic Church

The *Star Wars* legitimation crisis is compared to the Catholic Church's crisis in the 1500s when congregations rebelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Before the 16th century, the Church controlled the Bible's meaning because few had access to hard copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440 allowed rapid text reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Suddenly, ordinary people could read the Bible and develop different interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

This crisis occurred because the masses began producing, not just consuming, canonical interpretations, challenging the Church's authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Figures like Martin Luther posted "95 reasons why the Catholic Church sucked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

In this metaphor, the original *Star Wars* universe is the Bible, and George Lucas, as its creator, was its interpreter – akin to an apostle or prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. With Disney, authority shifted from a single, "divinely inspired leader" to a "larger and fallible organization," leading people to question its authority in developing quasi-holy texts or canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Decanonization and Identity

Disney further exacerbated the crisis by "decanonizing" radio dramas, video games, comics, and hundreds of spin-off novels that Lucasfilm previously considered part of the "gospel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. A lifeworld defines a community's identity, clarifying who belongs and who can be trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Hacking away at what counts as *Star Wars* impacts fans whose identities are deeply intertwined with the franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

## The Age of the Prosumer

Unlike the Catholic Church's crisis, where people gained the ability to read, today's problem is that people can blog, tweet, make video essays, produce cartoons, and stream content to millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. For every Martin Luther, there are millions of angry YouTubers and vloggers criticizing Disney *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

This era is defined by "prosumerism," a term coined in the 1980s by futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler, describing the merging roles of producer and consumer in the age of modern technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. *Star Wars* fans are "prosumers extraordinaire," actively creating meaning through YouTube videos, fan theories, Reddit posts, and tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. Every theory about characters or fighting styles contributes to the *Star Wars* universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

This empowerment of prosumers allows them to criticize the "anointed successors" of Lucas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Director James Mangold noted that writing and directing big franchises has become emotionally equivalent to writing a new chapter of the Bible, with the risk of being called a blasphemer, potentially driving away "bolder minds" from these films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

## Future of the Star Wars System

While the *Star Wars* system faces a crisis, it may not collapse entirely, just as the Catholic Church did not crumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. Systems can learn and adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. The Catholic Church revised its theology and solidified its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

The future of *Star Wars* depends on whether Disney can evolve in the age of prosumerism by respecting fans and the universe they helped create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Fans also have a choice to grow with the system or, like the Catholics and Protestants, part ways and create their own versions, competing for viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

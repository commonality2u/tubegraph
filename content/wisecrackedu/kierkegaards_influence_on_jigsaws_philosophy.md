The popular horror franchise "Saw" features Jigsaw, a "creepy puppet-master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> who locks up "morally-dubious characters" in gruesome contraptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While many focus on Jigsaw's body count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, his deadly traps contain a "grander meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> rooted in [[Philosophical Themes in the Saw Franchise | philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## [[Jigsaws Morality and Motivations | Jigsaw's Motivation]]

The core of [[Jigsaws Morality and Motivations | Jigsaw's motivation]] is that his torturous games are meant as opportunities for his victims to "repent for their sins and ostensibly, to transform into better human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He believes that if they survive his tests, they will emerge with "a newfound ability to appreciate life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

> "Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

### The Origin of Jigsaw's Philosophy

Before becoming Jigsaw, John Kramer was a civil engineer with a pregnant wife, Jill, who owned a drug rehab clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After one of Jill's patients, Cecil Adams, caused her miscarriage, John fell into depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Soon after, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and terminal cancer, leading to further depression and the deterioration of his relationship with Jill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Following an unsuccessful suicide attempt by driving off a cliff, John Kramer survived and was "totally sure of his new calling: dispensing morality, one torture device at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Influence of [[Early Christian Philosophy and Suffering in Saw | Early Christian Philosophy]]

John Kramer's "fresh code of morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> appears inspired by [[Early Christian Philosophy and Suffering in Saw | early Christian philosophy]], particularly its views on suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Early Christian tradition rationalized suffering by attributing it to human fault and sin, stemming from Adam's Original Sin, which separated humans from God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Suffering and repentance were deemed necessary for reunification with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Jigsaw similarly believes his victims deserve the suffering they endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, often reminding them of their sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He views his victims as "enslaved by their past immorality," much like theologians believed humanity was trapped by Original Sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The series even includes characters named Adam, like Cecil Adams, whose actions trigger John's transformation, and Adam Stanheight, whose "seedy 'knowledge'" parallels Adam's desire to eat from the Tree of Knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Søren Kierkegaard's Influence

John Kramer also shares a common thread with the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, considered the father of [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Both Kramer and Kierkegaard experienced significant personal suffering, including losses and difficult relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Suffering as a Path to Growth

Crucially, both believed that "suffering purifies the sufferer, teaches them to appreciate life, and forces them to take responsibility for their actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Kierkegaard proposed three distinct phases for an individual to become their "true self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>:
*   **The Aesthetic**: Driven by sensual pleasures and lacking morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **The Ethical**: Driven by morality and belief in individual responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **The Religious**: Driven by faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

According to Kierkegaard, suffering is essential for moving to the next stage of human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While he referred to spiritual and existential suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, Jigsaw's machines can be seen as tests for his victims, who are often "aesthetes driven by desires for sex, drugs, or money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. These tests present "an ethical quandary that usually forces them to make a painful decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, aligning with Kierkegaard's explanation of the journey from aesthetic to ethical being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Suffering, for Kierkegaard, forces reflection, leading to "the first doubt" ("Why is this happening to me; can it not be otherwise?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This moment generates a desire to change circumstances and opens a person to "ethical self-understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Suffering is "growth-inducing because it 'turns the single individual over to himself completely'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, ideally leading to repentance, taking responsibility for guilt, and choosing survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. As one progresses, a "false self" dies, making way for a "better, truer self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, a concept reflected in John Kramer's own experience after his car crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

This concept of shedding the old self is vividly portrayed in the "Saw" series. Jigsaw demands his follower Amanda "give everything" and "leave that life behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Fans refer to this scene as "Amanda's baptism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, fitting given how baptism and suffering in Christian tradition relate to spiritual cleansing and rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Jigsaw frequently references "rebirth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, and even his first kidnapping occurs during a Chinese New Year celebration, a literal celebration of rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Personal Responsibility and Choice

Kierkegaard and Jigsaw both emphasize personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Kierkegaard stated that becoming "a real man" means becoming a "responsible individual before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Kramer demands the same, believing the key to responsibility is "making a choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, spurring his victims into "life-affirming action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

> “Live or die. Make your choice.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>

Kierkegaard believed that in the moment of making a choice, "a man 'becomes himself'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Jigsaw is adamant that his victims "choose" their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a> and maintains that the individual is responsible for the outcome of their decision within his games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

> “I’ve never murdered anyone in my life. The decisions are up to them.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>

## [[Flaws in Jigsaws Moral Code and Legacy | Critique of Jigsaw's Philosophy]]

Despite these influences, the "Saw" series ultimately critiques Jigsaw's "extreme version of traditional Christian morality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Presented as a "god-like figure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, Jigsaw's attempts to establish moral order fail to bring about meaningful change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Most victims fail their tests or are traumatized if they survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

His apprentices, in particular, twist his philosophy, creating "rigged games that are unwinnable death traps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a> and using them for punishment rather than renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This highlights the [[Flaws in Jigsaws Moral Code and Legacy | flawed moral code]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> and [[Flaws in Jigsaws Moral Code and Legacy | Jigsaw's failed legacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Jigsaw's justice is not dispensed fairly, and his death, rather than offering salvation, is a result of one of his tests' ultimate failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

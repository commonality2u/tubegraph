One of the essential features of *[[Rick and Mortys View on Religion and Atheism | Rick and Morty]]* is its tendency to trivialize everything people hold dear, including religion, which for billions, is considered sacred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While religion is frequently an overt target of Rick's contempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, often being reduced to mere superstition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, the episode "Get Schwifty" offers a more complex exploration of how humans rationalize such thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## "Get Schwifty" and the Nature of Belief

The episode "Get Schwifty" serves as a primary example of the show's philosophical approach to belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. When giant floating heads, known as Cromulons, appear and demand a hit song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, humanity is plunged into chaos with earthquakes, sinkholes, fires, and massive flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This event is used to satirize the opportunistic nature of organized religion, as churches prioritize fundraising and repairs amidst global catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### The Rise of Headism

A cult called "Headism" emerges among those who are unaware that the Cromulons are merely filming a reality show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This cult forms because people lack understanding of the Cromulons' true nature and demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Headism can be seen as a scathing indictment of religion, highlighting the arbitrary nature of faith and its ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For instance, on "Ascension Day," the Headists send "unwantables" to the gods, an act reminiscent of Christ's crucifixion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

However, the episode delves deeper, targeting the reasoning behind belief structures themselves, not just religious practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It exposes the fallacies underlying various beliefs people hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Logical Fallacies and Human Cognition

"Get Schwifty" lampoons two common logical fallacies that conflate correlation with causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>:

*   **Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc Fallacy:** The mistaken belief that two unrelated events occurring simultaneously are causally linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   The Headist religion begins when Principal Vagina prays to the Head just as the cataclysmic events subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. In reality, the Heads stop the disasters because they are pleased with Rick's performance of "Get Schwifty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   Later, when Principal Vagina attempts to ascend Beth and Jerry, the Heads begin booing, leading people to believe the Heads are displeased by their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The Heads are actually angry because Rick's subsequent performance without Morty is terrible, compounded by a nuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc Fallacy:** The idea that because one thing precedes another, it must be the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   The President, for example, incorrectly concludes that certain musicians die simply because he names them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The characters with limited understanding believe their mundane ceremonies influence the cosmic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Beth and Jerry even point out this logical fallacy explicitly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### The [[Structure of human belief and cognition in Rick and Morty | Structure of Human Belief and Cognition]]

While satirizing "magical thinking," the episode makes a broader point: people don't adopt silly beliefs solely out of irrationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Instead, they *over-rationalize* their thinking to the point of absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Cognitive psychologists suggest that pseudo-scientific belief systems, such as doomsday cults, psychics, and conspiracy theories, are resilient because they are sustained by the structure of the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. These systems persist through appeals to rationality, not trickery or mass stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The human brain is wired to seek logical conclusions and simple explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. People tend to believe what aligns with their worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, a phenomenon known as **confirmation bias**: the tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms existing beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This bias explains why individuals may overlook flaws in their belief systems for personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, as seen with Summer's family benefiting from the Headist cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Pervasive Fallacies

These fallacies and biases are not exclusive to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. *[[Rick and Mortys View on Religion and Atheism | Rick and Morty]]* illustrates that post-hoc rationalization is an inevitable part of human cause-and-effect thought processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Even the audience can be fooled by the brain's tendency to accept logical fallacies, as demonstrated by Rick's "snake and wristwatch" trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This trick plays on the brain's desire to attribute event A as the cause of event B, even when there's no real connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

*Rick and Morty* delivers the irony that cosmic events leading to a religion can be based on completely inaccurate premises, such as a reality TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The show takes its critique further by challenging the human capacity to make predictions and fully comprehend the complexity of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, distinguishing *[[Satire and Social Commentary in Rick and Morty | Rick and Morty]]* from contemporary satire by leaving nothing, not even belief, safe from scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

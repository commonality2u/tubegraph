_The Lion King_ is an artifact starring EGOT winners Whoopi Goldberg and James Earl Ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The film takes place on a landmass called Africa, where animals speak English and are ruled by the lion Mufasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Mufasa's brother, [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]], orchestrates Mufasa's death and manipulates Simba into believing it was his fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Simba flees and lives with Timon and Pumbaa in a "hippie commune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He later returns, confronts [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]], and reclaims his place as king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The film's landscape magically transforms from a barren wasteland to a lush paradise once Simba becomes king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The narrative concludes with the idea of the "circle of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Inspirations and Hidden Meanings

### [[comparison_between_the_lion_king_and_hamlet | The Lion King]] and Hamlet
[[comparison_between_the_lion_king_and_hamlet | The Lion King]] is "loosely based on the movie Hamlet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, sharing the same plot and characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Similarities include:
*   A king murdered by his brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   The son of the murdered king visited by his father's ghost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   Two comic foils who help the hero relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

This inspiration from "a guy from olden times" might explain the film's "oddly conservative message" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### The "Circle of Life" and Social Order
A significant theme in [[themes_of_social_order_and_hierarchy_in_the_lion_king | The Lion King]] is the "circle of life," presented as a natural, fixed social order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Disruption of this order is portrayed as leading to chaos and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Mufasa uses this concept to rationalize the predatory nature of the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

This concept symbolizes a feudal social order where an individual's value is determined by birth, not merit, action, or bribery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For those not born at the top, there is no opportunity for upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The film's underlying message is "know your place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When Rafiki presents Simba on Pride Rock, it implicitly conveys: "Behold the creature that will one day feast on your carcass in accordance with the laws of the universe. Resistance is futile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The animals confirm their place in the world through subjugation, which brings them peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### The Noble Lie
The concept of the "circle of life" connects to Greek philosopher Socrates' "noble lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. As documented by Plato in _The New Republic_, Socrates theorized that if humans believed God had sprinkled gold into the souls of important people and less precious metals into others, they would accept their lot in life as divinely ordained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]]'s Rebellion and Political Undertones
[[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]] is presented as the only animal to reject this feudal society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He laments that "life isn’t fair" and rebels against a "natural" societal order that labels him a weakling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. When [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]] takes power, he ushers in an era of "equality," allowing hyenas to be on equal footing with lions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

However, despite his "progressive politics," [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]] is not entirely altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. His song about a new world order features "Nazi marching imagery and camera movements lifted from Leni Reifenstahl’s Triumph of the Will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Like "Adam Hitler," [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]]'s reign leads to a once prosperous utopia descending into anarchy and starvation by interfering with the "natural order of the food chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Hakuna Matata
The phrase "Hakuna Matata" is translated roughly to "fuck it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, suggesting a way to combat social injustice by simply giving up control or concern.

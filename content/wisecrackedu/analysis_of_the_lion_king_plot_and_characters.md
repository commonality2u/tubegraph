*The Lion King*, hosted by Garyx Wormuloid for Earthling Cinema, is an animated film starring EGOT winners Whoopi Goldberg and James Earl Ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Despite common beliefs, the film is asserted not to be a direct ripoff of the Japanese anime *Kimba the White Lion* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Plot Summary

The story unfolds on a landmass identified as Africa, inhabited solely by English-speaking animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The animal kingdom is ruled by the lion Mufasa, who has recently fathered a cub named Simba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Simba quickly becomes obsessed with seizing power, expressing his desire for his father's death through song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Mufasa's brother, Scar, who also harbored wishes for Mufasa's demise, decides to act on his own desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Scar orchestrates Mufasa's death in a wildebeest stampede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He then deceives Simba into believing he was responsible for his father's death, leading Simba to flee the kingdom and leave the throne to Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Simba is adopted by a "kindly gay couple" and lives with them in a "hippie commune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Later, he reunites with his friend Nala, who encourages him to reclaim his rightful place as king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Initially, Simba resists, favoring his new lifestyle of "good vibes and organic farming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, a ghostly apparition conveys the same message, prompting Simba to confront Scar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. After a struggle, Simba defeats Scar, throwing him to the "wolves"—an Earth expression meaning "horses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Upon Simba's ascension to the throne, the barren land miraculously transforms back into a lush paradise, ready for the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Characters

*   **Mufasa**: The lion king and Simba's father, who is portrayed as boastful about his offspring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. He justifies the predatory nature of the animal kingdom through the [[themes_of_social_order_and_hierarchy_in_the_lion_king | "circle of life"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Simba**: Mufasa's son, who initially desires his father's death to seize power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He is later tricked into believing he caused his father's death and runs away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He eventually returns to confront Scar and become king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Simba is said to be "baptized in the feudal social order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Scar**: Mufasa's brother and Simba's uncle, who also wished for Mufasa's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He is the only animal who rejects the "feudal society," perhaps due to a visible head wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. [[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]] rebels against the "natural" societal order that labels him a weakling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. When he takes power, he implements "progressive politics" by allowing hyenas equal standing with lions, ushering in an "era of equality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. However, his reign turns sour, leading to anarchy and starvation by interfering with the natural food chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
*   **Timon and Pumbaa**: Described as a "kindly gay couple" who take Simba in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They serve as "comic foils" who help the hero relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Nala**: Simba's old friend who encourages him to return to his royal duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Influences and Themes

*The Lion King* is described as being "loosely based" on the movie *Hamlet*, directed by William Shakeshack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This [[comparison_between_the_lion_king_and_hamlet | comparison between The Lion King and Hamlet]] is highlighted by shared plot points and characters: a king murdered by his brother, the son visited by his father's ghost, and two comic foils aiding the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

The film's "oddly conservative message" is emphasized through the [[themes_of_social_order_and_hierarchy_in_the_lion_king | "circle of life"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This concept suggests a "natural, fixed social order" that, if disrupted, leads to chaos and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Within this order, an individual's value is determined by birth, not by merit or action, with no opportunity for upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The film's message is seen as "know your place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Rafiki's presentation of Simba on Pride Rock implies that the animals are meant to accept their subjugation to confirm their place and find peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

This concept ties into Greek philosopher Socrates’ "noble lie," as documented by Plato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Socrates theorized that if people believed God ordained their social status through the metals in their souls, they would accept their lot in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

[[scars_role_and_political_undertones_in_the_lion_king | Scar]] is presented as the only character to reject this feudal society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. His song about a new world order includes [[symbolism_and_hidden_messages_in_the_lion_king | Nazi marching imagery]] and camera movements inspired by Leni Reifenstahl’s *Triumph of the Will* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. His reign, similar to "Adam Hitler," leads to chaos and starvation by interfering with the "natural order of the food chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. The only way to combat social injustice is suggested to be "Hakuna Matata," roughly translating to "fuck it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

The film series *The Purge* is presented as a socio-political commentary, serving as a thinly veiled allegory for America's corrupt politics, rigged economic systems, and culture of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The societal order depicted in the films can be described as [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Neoliberalism Explained
The fundamental principle of [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberalism]] posits that the government should primarily focus on crafting policies that foster the free flow of goods and safeguard corporate interests, rather than extensive market intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Economic Inequality in The Purge Series
Each installment of *The Purge* series explores a distinct aspect of the neoliberal economy, highlighting how characters' interactions with the Purge event illuminate their respective economic class conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   **The Original Purge**: This film focuses on an upper-middle-class suburban family, the Sandins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. They can afford protection during the Purge, benefiting from their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The Sandins' lavish home remodel is funded by sales of security systems, preying on the fear generated by The Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The idea that violence against the poor would affect their neighborhood is unacceptable to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Anarchy**: This movie shifts focus to the economic struggles of a working-class family, specifically Eva Sanchez, who cannot afford medicine for her father and desperately needs a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The inner city is depicted as rampant with Purge traps, gangs, kidnappings, and scenes of violence and attempted rape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The comparison between the suburban setting of the first film and the inner-city setting of *Anarchy* serves as a metaphor for "white flight," where the affluent retreat to sheltered suburbs, leaving those in the inner city vulnerable to disproportionate crime, homelessness, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **The Purge: Election Year**: This film addresses the impact of the Purge on small business owners, exemplified by Joe, whose Purge insurance premiums inexplicably skyrocket right before the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This scenario highlights a common problem in the absence of government oversight on insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Unable to afford coverage, Joe attempts to protect his deli with a shoddy steel door and ultimately loses his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

The films collectively illustrate the injustices embedded not only within The Purge itself but also within the broader economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Those who thrive under [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberalism]] benefit from The Purge, while those disadvantaged by [[Neoliberalism in South Park Season 19 | neoliberalism]] are further exploited by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### The Politics of Disposability
The Purge viscerally demonstrates how neoliberal economics fosters a [[the_politics_of_disposability_and_class_struggle | politics of disposability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. According to thinkers Henry Giroux and Brad Evans, people become disposable within an economic system characterized by the privatization of essential services like healthcare, the deregulation of banks, and the weakening of government safety nets such as social security and welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

*   In *The Original Purge*, suburbanites perceive certain groups as superfluous and disposable, referring to a homeless man as "swine" and "filth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. James Sandin initially justifies incapacitating and torturing his house guest as a means to protect his family, only recognizing him as fully human when the guest volunteers to sacrifice himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   In *The Purge: Anarchy*, the exorbitant cost of medication leads Papa Sanchez to "sell" his life to the wealthy, allowing his family to escape economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. His life, as a disposable object, holds more economic value to his family than his existence as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The wealthy conduct their "Purge" by purchasing poor and sick individuals and killing them in their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   This concept is mirrored in *Rick and Morty*, where a character states that the powerful subject others to inhumane conditions because they believe there's no chance of it harming themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) legalize murder during The Purge to reduce the poor population, thereby decreasing government spending on welfare, healthcare, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This logic extends to shutting down medical and police services during the Purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This is all rationalized under the guise of [[the_complexity_and_power_dynamics_of_economics | economic growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The elderly, the infirm, the poor, and "non-contributors" are sacrificed to ensure an unhindered economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

This concept of population elimination for economic reasons draws from Thomas Robert Malthus's 1798 "Essay on the Principle of Population," which argued that population growth would outstrip production, leading to food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Malthus proposed laws to keep birth rates low and death rates high through famine, disease, and wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Caleb Warrens, head of the NFFA in *The Purge: Election Year*, echoes this Malthusian idea, stating that "some cannot have" because there's "not enough to go around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

However, Friedrich Engels countered Malthus, arguing that the problem is not increasing population but an economic system that devalues workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Engels believed Malthus's model was merely an excuse to treat poor people badly, prioritizing economics over human well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The NFFA's elaborate Purge ceremonies suggest motivations beyond mere economic concerns, elevating the mistreatment of the poor to an extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Predatory Profits
The genius of *The Purge* films lies in their visceral exposure of how a neoliberal economy generates predatory profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The privileged amass wealth from weapon sales, insurance, private bodyguards, and home security systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, while the poor are left to fight for their mere survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

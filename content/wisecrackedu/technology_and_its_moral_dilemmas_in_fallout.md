The *Fallout* series, set in an [[alternate_history_and_societal_commentary_in_the_fallout_series | alternate reality]] of the 23rd century, provides a rich setting for [[philosophical_themes_in_postapocalyptic_fiction | philosophical analysis]], particularly regarding technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The game explores how humanity's relationship with technology, from its optimistic pre-war proliferation to its devastating post-apocalyptic consequences, consistently presents complex moral dilemmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Pre-War Society and Technological Optimism

In the *Fallout* universe, a fascination with atomic power proliferated in the mid-20th century, largely because the transistor was never invented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This led to a technologically advanced society that was "big and bulky," with primitive computers but also powerful innovations like power armor and laser guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The pre-war world was characterized by "sheer optimism" about atomic energy, believing that "our greatest dreams could be accomplished with a little ingenuity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This optimism was so pervasive that even the prospect of nuclear annihilation was advertised cheerfully through Vault posters, showcasing the human power of cognitive dissonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse observed this phenomenon during the Cold War, arguing that "pleasant appearances plastered over modern day nightmares" demonstrate society's ability to "destroy criticism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Capitalism's marketing prowess, according to Marcuse, can make even the worst realities seem "dandy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This "obscene merger" between appearance and reality is a key source of *Fallout*'s humor, constantly contrasting the "quaint and cheery Leave-it-to-Beaver-esque culture" with the "hellscape it's set in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This extends to the game's radio stations playing cheerful jazz over the post-apocalyptic "Wasteland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

More profoundly, these contrasts critique [[critique_of_government_and_propaganda_in_a_dystopian_setting | government propaganda]] and highlight how society celebrates the same culture and technology that leads to "total annihilation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Marcuse called this "one-dimensional thought," where rationality and technology are presented as always progressing "forward," with no room for "negative thought" or criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Technology Run Amok and Player Choices

The game constantly reminds players that "technology is a double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. From the Great War that decimated the world to secret government experiments that created Super Mutants, technology is shown as "run amok" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. As a player, this leads to significant [[moral_dilemmas_and_justice_in_the_dark_knight | moral dilemmas]] regarding how technology should be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>:
*   Should technology provide clean water or unleash a devastating virus to "purify" the Wasteland? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
*   Who should control Mr. House's robotic army in *New Vegas*? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

*Fallout* draws inspiration from the Greek myth of Phaethon, who disastrously took his father Helios's sun chariot for a ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. In *New Vegas*, the giant solar plant is named Helios One, allowing the player to "gleefully take the sun’s destructive power for a joy ride and slaughter thousands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This highlights the dangers of unchecked technological power in human hands.

## Factions' Approaches to Technology

Different [[social_and_political_structures_in_the_fallout_universe | factions]] in *Fallout* present contrasting views on technology:

### The Brotherhood of Steel
This "secretive order of power-armor clad badasses" roams the Wasteland collecting lost technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. They hoard technology in heavily armored bases, believing it shouldn't "fall into the wrong hands" – meaning, anyone but themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The Brotherhood is willing to go to war with any faction possessing advanced tech, driven by the belief that "nobody can be trusted with technology but themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. However, the game questions whether they, too, should be trusted with such power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Caesar's Legion
Conversely, [[dictatorship_and_politics_in_postapocalyptic_settings | Caesar's Legion]] largely "swears off technology," except for that which enhances killing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Caesar believes technology makes people "weak and dependent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Despite this rejection of advanced tech, the Legion establishes a "brutal, totalitarian state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This suggests that technology itself isn't solely to blame for society's ills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Technology and Control

Technology in *Fallout* can also be a tool for control and [[dictatorship_and_politics_in_postapocalyptic_settings | tyranny]].
*   **The Enclave:** What remains of the pre-war U.S. government, led by the AI President John Henry Eden, seeks to "purge the Wasteland of, well, everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Eden's radio addresses praise leisure and recreation like baseball, aiming to resurrect a "distracted society" that would be "too happy to care" about being exterminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This demonstrates how technology (in this case, an AI ruler) can be used to maintain "one-dimensional thinking" and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The Enclave justifies its genocidal actions "in the interest of national security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

*   **Mr. House:** In *New Vegas*, working with Mr. House leads to an ending where New Vegas becomes "a despotic vision of pre-War glory. The streets were orderly, efficient, cold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Mr. House explicitly states his "distaste for freedom," believing that "autocracy" under a "technological and economic visionary" is superior to "democracies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This illustrates how order and security can be achieved at the "expense of personal freedoms and democracy," a theme seen in historical dictatorships that use "manufactured crises" to justify repressive laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

Ultimately, *Fallout* interrogates human society and government, suggesting that "War never changes" and by extension, "humanity never changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. The game's most terrifying aspects are not just mutated creatures, but the "rehashing of our own regrettable history," including totalitarian regimes and genocidal governments, underscoring that history often repeats itself, even with advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

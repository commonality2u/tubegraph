*The Dark Knight Rises* is noted for its significant intellectual ambition, particularly in adapting and exploring complex themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Among these, the concept of the "noble lie" inherited from its predecessor, *[[Thematic influence of A Tale of Two Cities in The Dark Knight Rises | The Dark Knight]]*, stands out as a central, though ultimately critiqued, thematic element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

## The Noble Lie Established in *The Dark Knight*

One of the essential themes introduced in *[[Thematic influence of A Tale of Two Cities in The Dark Knight Rises | The Dark Knight]]* is the conflict between truth and lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. The film concludes with a "noble lie" when Batman takes responsibility for Harvey Dent’s murders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This act denies the fall of Gotham’s savior and upholds Dent's image as an ideal symbol of justice and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

This concept is present in other notable works:
*   In Joseph Conrad’s *Heart of Darkness*, Marlowe lies to Kurtz’s intended, telling her that his last words were her name, sparing her the truth of his deranged death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   In Alan Moore’s *Watchmen*, the team agrees to preserve Ozymandias’s lie about an extraterrestrial force killing millions to maintain peace between the US and the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Both *Heart of Darkness* and *Watchmen* end with the truth remaining hidden, prompting contemplation on whether the truth or a saving lie is more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. *[[Thematic influence of A Tale of Two Cities in The Dark Knight Rises | The Dark Knight]]* leaves audiences with a similar ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

## The Noble Lie in *The Dark Knight Rises*

*The Dark Knight Rises* attempts to pick up this theme, exploring what happens when a noble lie is exposed to the "vulgar truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### The Dent Act and its Interpretations
The noble lie is manifested in "The Dent Act," legislation that grants law enforcement increased power to prosecute organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
*   **Patriot Act Metaphor**: The Dent Act can be read as a metaphor for the Patriot Act, which faced criticism for giving the government excessive power to combat terrorism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. This interpretation is supported by the Joker's radicalism being seen as a reflection of Al Qaeda extremism in the previous film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Atheistic Christ Figure**: Harvey Dent can also be viewed as a Christ figure without resurrection, suggesting an atheistic interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. In this reading, if Christ had not been resurrected but a lie about it was fabricated to maintain his divine status, he would become a false idol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. This "false idol" of Dent would still need to be upheld to maintain peace and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. "Harvey Dent Day" in Gotham further celebrates his legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. This perspective aligns the Dent Act with how religion has justified acts of power, such as the Inquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## Critiques of the Theme's Execution

Despite its promising setup, the exploration of the noble lie in *The Dark Knight Rises* is criticized for its execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### Lack of Corruption
The film fails to show evidence that the Dent Act, a product of the noble lie, is corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. In fact, it appears to be highly effective in eliminating organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   When Bane reveals the truth about Harvey Dent being a false idol and the Dent Act being built on a lie, it leads to social unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. However, the film struggles to convincingly argue that revealing the truth itself causes negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   Alfred revealing the truth about Rachel choosing Dent over Bruce drives them further apart, pushing Bruce towards a suicidal mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

### The Cycle of Lies
The film is seen to revert to the conclusion of *[[Thematic influence of A Tale of Two Cities in The Dark Knight Rises | The Dark Knight]]*, where everything is resolved only when the truth is buried and another lie is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Bruce Wayne fakes his death by falsely claiming the Bat's autopilot was broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This narrative of Batman sacrificing himself for Gotham creates a new image of justice for Gotham to revere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. Gordon's quote of Carton's Christ-like sacrifice from *[[Thematic influence of A Tale of Two Cities in The Dark Knight Rises | A Tale of Two Cities]]* at Bruce's funeral further suggests Batman's sacrifice is also Christ-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. The film's ending implies that while Batman did not truly sacrifice himself, believing the lie that he did is necessary, mirroring the necessity of believing in Dent's noble image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

This cyclical nature means that after nearly three hours of development, the theme of truth brings the audience back to the same point as *[[Thematic influence of A Tale of Two Cities in The Dark Knight Rises | The Dark Knight]]*: the necessity of a lie to uphold faith in justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### Underdeveloped Worldbuilding and Social Inequality
For the noble lie theme to truly develop, a scenario where toxic lies lead to corruption, making truth revelation beneficial, would be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. The film attempts this by suggesting that the corruption of the Dent Act leads to Bane’s social revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. Bane is supposed to be the outcome of this toxic lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, functioning as a product of escalation similar to how the [[Exposition in Inception | Joker]] arose in *[[Thematic influence of A Tale of Two Cities in The Dark Knight Rises | The Dark Knight]]* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

However, the film provides no concrete evidence of corruption stemming from the Dent Act or the lie that justifies it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. While an instance of police using surveillance (potentially enabled by the Dent Act) saves Catwoman’s life, the film fails to show negative consequences of invasive surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. This missed opportunity could have shown how those in power use lies to justify excessive authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

Furthermore, while *[[Thematic influence of A Tale of Two Cities in The Dark Knight Rises | A Tale of Two Cities]]* effectively depicts the corruption of the elite leading to social unrest, *The Dark Knight Rises* offers a vague portrayal of the social tensions that lead to Bane’s revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. Blackgate Prison, meant to symbolize the Dent Act’s oppression and likened to the Bastille, is not shown to be gratuitously cruel or to wrongfully imprison people for criticizing the government or religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. The film also fails to establish how the Dent Act or Blackgate are disenfranchising the poor, beyond a child's suggestion that economic situations drive orphans to Bane's army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

This lack of established grievances against the rich or the Dent Act's corruption leads to criticisms of the film as anti-Occupy Wall Street propaganda, portraying activists as easily manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. This issue is ultimately seen as one of underdeveloped worldbuilding rather than intentional political moralizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

In conclusion, while *The Dark Knight Rises* demonstrates significant ambition in tackling the noble lie theme, its execution is hampered by a failure to convincingly depict the negative consequences of the lie or the societal conditions that would justify its exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. This ultimately leaves the audience in a similar thematic position to the end of *[[Thematic influence of A Tale of Two Cities in The Dark Knight Rises | The Dark Knight]]*, without a clear development of the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

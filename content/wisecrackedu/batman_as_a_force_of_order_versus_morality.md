From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

In [[The Dark Knight | The Dark Knight]], Bruce Wayne, as Batman, serves as a central figure representing order, often achieved through methods that challenge conventional morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While he initially yearns for a world where he could be replaced by District Attorney Harvey Dent, the "White Knight," Batman ultimately becomes the necessary force to maintain order in Gotham City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Order Through Force

Unlike Dent, who embodies order through idealism, Batman establishes order through force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. He is depicted as a "fascist," a "necessary evil" employed to control the "beastly side of mankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This approach contrasts sharply with the chaos and "existential anarchy" propagated by [[The Jokers role in exploring moral dilemmas and challenging conventional morality | the Joker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Challenging Conventional Morality

Batman's commitment to upholding order often leads him to actions that push the boundaries of [[moral dilemmas and justice in The Dark Knight | morality]]:

*   **Ferry Scene**: The film suggests that democratic methods are insufficient to uphold justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The ferry scene illustrates that given a simple vote, people would choose the "amoral thing" (destroying another boat for survival), indicating that "tyrannical power" is sometimes required to ultimately maintain justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Sonar Machine**: Batman's creation and use of the sonar machine is described as a "tremendous violation of privacy," bordering on "morally bankrupt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. However, as Alfred explains, extreme measures, such as "burn[ing] the forest down," are sometimes necessary to apprehend dangerous criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Ultimately, Batman takes the responsibility to maintain the facade of hope and order, even if it means sacrificing his own reputation and operating outside strict moral guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*Rick & Morty*, created by showrunners Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, is renowned for its mastery of story structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The series exemplifies how a deep understanding of narrative principles can elevate an animated show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Dan Harmon's Story Embryo

Dan Harmon posits that every story, from epic tales like *The Odyssey* to simple jokes, follows an 8-step structure he calls "the story embryo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This model, similar to [[the_heros_journey_and_narrative_structure | the hero's journey]], outlines a fundamental narrative arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

The eight steps are:
1.  A character is in a zone of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  But they want something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  They enter an unfamiliar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  Adapt to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
5.  Get what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
6.  Pay a heavy price for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
7.  Then return to their familiar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
8.  Having changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Television Story Structure

While the "story embryo" applies broadly, its application changes based on genre and medium, especially for television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Unlike movies that aim for a finite emotional high, television's goal is to keep viewers watching indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Harmon suggests this is to induce a "vegetative state" conducive to commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Consequently, television shows emphasize preserving the status quo rather than focusing on character change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, *The Dark Knight Rises* sees Batman's story conclude with a new life, whereas *Batman: The Animated Series* consistently shows Batman fighting villains in the same Gotham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Harmon states that television "swaps out any meaningful and therefore potentially television-subverting truth with the basic, eternal 'truth' that change is unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The typical TV episode structure often looks like this:
1.  "I (the protagonist)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
2.  "Notice a small problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
3.  "And make a major decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>
4.  "This changes things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
5.  "To some satisfaction, but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
6.  "There are consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
7.  "That must be undone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
8.  "And I must admit the futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>

## Applying the Structure to *Rick & Morty*

Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon adhere to this structural advice, with every episode of *Rick & Morty* following this format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. A prime example is Season 2, Episode 6, "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Step 1: Establish a Protagonist in a Zone of Comfort
Harmon advises immediately fading onto characters doing something relatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" opens with Summer, Rick, and Morty leaving the movie "Ball Fondlers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Within 20 seconds, the episode establishes the protagonists and their world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Step 2: Introduce a Small Problem and Establish a Need
In this step, the protagonist realizes life isn't perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For the Sanchez family, it's Rick's ship refusing to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Rick quickly identifies the problem: the Microverse Battery is dead, requiring them to go inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Morty's reluctance ("Um, go inside what?") is a narrative trick that helps the audience identify with him and become more invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Step 3: The Protagonist Makes a Major Decision and Enters an Unfamiliar Situation
This step marks the "descent into the unknown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Rick and Morty literally shrink down to visit a world inside Rick’s car battery, posing as aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Harmon emphasizes the importance of noticeable contrast between worlds, not epic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The episode introduces a completely foreign world of Martian-like people who venerate Rick for giving them electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Unbeknownst to them, Rick's "Gooble Boxes" redirect most of their power to his ship, and he has manipulated their civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Step 4: Characters Adapt to the New Situation and Things Must Change
This stage is about characters learning their place in the new world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. For TV, this is less about internal character change and more about external change, preserving the status quo for future episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Upon arriving in the Microverse, Rick and Morty identify the problem: Zeep Xanflorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Zeep is a near-identical copy of Rick, who also created his own Microverse, rendering Rick's Gooble Boxes obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Faced with his own hypocrisy, Rick shamelessly parrots Morty's earlier objections, leading to a new conflict: Rick must find a scientist in Zeep's Microverse who is creating *their* own Microverse to force Zeep to admit his hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Step 5: The Character Gets What They Wanted
Positioned at the bottom of the story circle, opposite comfort, this is where the hero hits rock-bottom and finds what they were looking for, initiating a shift in motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Rick reaches Step 5 when he finds Kyle, a scientist in Zeep’s Microverse, who is creating his own Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. In an [[critiques_of_inceptions_exposition_and_narrative_style | Inception]]-like nesting of universes, Rick smugly watches Zeep repeat the "slavery with extra steps" rant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. However, Zeep then realizes his own universe is a Microverse, leading to an existential rage where he and Rick fight, and Kyle suffers a meltdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Step 6: Paying a Heavy Price and Suffering the Consequences
This step mirrors Step 2, preparing the hero for their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. It's about the hero testing their will against the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Rick's triumph is short-lived; Kyle's existential crisis leads him to kill himself, trapping everyone in the "Tinyverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Rick and Zeep's egos prevent cooperation, leading them to declare war on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Step 7: Undoing the Damage and Returning the Familiar World
This step precedes the hero's resurfacing, akin to how Step 4 precedes the descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Returning to the old world is as difficult as leaving it, with elements of the lower world often giving chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Morty, living with Tree People, forces Rick and Zeep to put aside their egos and engineer an escape from Kyle’s Tinyverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Zeep, representing the lower world, acts as a "shadow" figure to Rick, embodying Rick's undesirable traits and serving as a final obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Unlike traditional heroes who transform, Rick is aware of his flaws but has no desire to fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The episode constantly parallels Rick and Zeep, making them equally flawed, resulting in Rick fighting a reflection of himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. With Zeep dealt with, Rick and Morty finally exit the Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

### Step 8: Change or the Futility of It
Typically, this is where the hero achieves fulfillment, integrating new skills into their old life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. However, for television, the hero can never be fully fulfilled, as that would eliminate the desire for future adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Upon returning to their "Ball Fondlers" reality, Rick's ship starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Rick explains that Zeep was forced to revert to "Gooble Box" technology to avoid his own Microverse battery being thrown away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The episode concludes with Rick, Morty, and Summer calmly eating ice cream, with Morty and Summer shell-shocked by the return to normalcy, fully embracing the futility of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Rick & Morty* is both familiar and radically different from other television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. While it parodies pop culture and plays with audience expectations, its core structure is that of a typical TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. However, *Rick & Morty* leverages this circular structure to make its audience confront "the depressing, crippling futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Rick re-enslaves an entire planet for something as mundane as ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This demonstrates that while Rick Sanchez may not believe in much, the creative team behind *Rick & Morty* strongly believes in the power of story structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

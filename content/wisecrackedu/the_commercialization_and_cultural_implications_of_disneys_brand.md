The Walt Disney Company has transformed from an industry giant to an "absolute behemoth" that owns or licenses much of what people love and hate, including franchises like *Star Wars* and X-Men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. In 2019 alone, Disney produced seven of the top ten highest-grossing films, such as *Avengers: Endgame*, *Aladdin*, *Frozen 2*, and *Toy Story 4* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This financial success is not new, as many of the top 50 highest-grossing films of all time were either made or later acquired by Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While impressive, Disney's expanding artistic reach may have negative implications for culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Disney's Growth and Acquisition Strategy

Over the past few decades, Disney has become a colossal entity, acquiring major properties such as The Muppets, Pixar, Marvel, *Star Wars*, and most recently, 21st Century Fox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This strategy of acquiring intellectual property dates back to the company's beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Walt Disney's early experience with his first success, *Oswald the Lucky Rabbit*, shaped his future business approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. After his distributor poached his animators and revealed that Disney didn't own the rights to Oswald, Walt Disney vowed to "own everything that he made" from that point on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This led to the creation of Mickey Mouse and Disney becoming a significant creative and financial powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. By 1937, Disney broke box office records with *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## The "Cuteness Factory": Alteration of Classic Stories

Disney's early success was built on a simple formula: find an existing story, make it as "cute and wholesome as possible" to maximize audience potential, and then profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This consistent aesthetic, characterized by "round faces, saucer eyes, [and] big goofy grins," was a deliberate choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Walt Disney was "ruthless in his quest to make all things adorable," acquiring, adapting, and twisting original artistic intentions beyond recognition for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This process of [[disneys_adaptation_and_alteration_of_classic_stories | adapting and altering classic stories]] involves bleaching them in a "caustic vat of cuteness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Case Study: Pinocchio

Disney's adaptation of *Pinocchio* exemplifies this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. In Disney's version, Pinocchio wishes to be a real boy and is granted his wish after proving to be brave, truthful, and unselfish, culminating in a happy ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, the original author, Carlo Collodi, never intended for his story to be heartwarming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

The original ending of Collodi's *Pinocchio* sees the puppet gruesomely hanged to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This darker, "bleak morality tale" intended to show that Pinocchio's misbehavior led to his suffering, where he was robbed, starved, and even had his legs sawed off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Disney "whitewashed Pinocchio" to fit its "cutesy aesthetic," removing the "dark satiric overtones" and transforming Pinocchio from a "total frat pro" to a naive character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Case Study: The Little Mermaid

The 1989 Disney classic, *The Little Mermaid*, is another example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's tale, Disney's retelling is a love story with a "happily ever after" where true love saves all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

In contrast, Andersen's source material is not happy or uplifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. His story portrays love primarily as suffering, with the mermaid enduring pain with every step and the prince never returning her affection, instead marrying another princess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Andersen intended the mermaid to be saved by sacrifice, not by love or a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. In his tale, she gives up her life to save the prince and is rewarded by being turned into a gentle spirit, earning a soul after 300 years of helping mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Andersen explicitly "despised Disney's ending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Other Alterations

Disney has consistently applied this "meat grinder" approach for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   The real *Pocahontas* story is not about freedom to love, but about colonists kidnapping a Native American woman and murdering her husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   The original *Sleeping Beauty* involves a woman being non-consensually impregnated and giving birth in her sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Cultural and Psychological Implications

The way Disney [[critiques_of_disneys_storytelling_methods | purges beloved fairy tales of their original intentions]] and "rewrites the narrative in our collective memories" is unsettling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This "Disney meat grinder," which polishes off rough edges, has consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. In the case of *Pocahontas*, it provides a "shitty history lesson" that some people may never question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Impact on Developing Minds
Fairy tales, despite their dark and complex nature, offer children a symbolic framework for understanding and coping with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. For example, children in a cancer clinic used fairy tales to express their anxieties, identifying with characters like the Big Bad Wolf to vent frustration or show bravery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Disney, however, often "strips these fairy tales of their bite," inserting bland, wholesome narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

Ironically, this creates potentially destructive narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Psychologist Susan Darker-Smith notes that young girls who identify with characters like Cinderella or Belle are more likely to end up in abusive relationships as adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. They believe that their love can change a partner's behavior, which is tragically different from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. By promoting a narrative where "all the world's problems can be solved by true love," Disney fails to provide children with tools for navigating real-life problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, which was the original purpose of fairy tales: to prepare children for the realities of adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This directly relates to [[disneys_influence_on_childrens_perceptions_and_morals | Disney's influence on children's perceptions and morals]].

### The Power of Cuteness
According to free market economist Milton Friedman, companies' sole responsibility is to make money, regardless of social consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This explains why Disney operates a "cuteness factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. When Disney experimented with darker films in the 1970s and 80s, like *The Black Cauldron*, they were box office failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The "Disney Renaissance" of the 1990s was a course correction back to sentimental cuteness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Studies show that cuteness boosts concentration, a mechanism useful for humans to pay attention to their young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. When volunteers were shown cute images, their nucleus accumbens (pleasure center) lit up, releasing dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This suggests that viewing Disney's adorable characters can be like receiving "micro doses of Disney branded brain candy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Cultural theorist Joshua Paul Dale calls the phenomenon of cuteness used for potentially nefarious purposes "evil cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Ultimately, for Disney, cuteness is a means to "pad its bottom line," regardless of whether the stories are truly beneficial for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## Disney's Influence on Modern Franchises

The [[disneys_acquisition_and_changes_to_star_wars_canon | acquisition of Star Wars]] by Disney has led to increased fan despair over creative choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The last trilogy began with sentimental fan service, briefly flirted with darkness in *The Last Jedi*, but then "quickly course corrected and opted for a sweet conclusion based on a magical kiss, romantic sacrifice and... everyone you care about is jedi royalty now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. This shows that there is "no property or franchise which disney won't find a way to wrap its cute little tentacles around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

## Conclusion

As Disney continues to expand, it is reasonable to worry about the expansion of its "blanket philosophy of cuteness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This cuteness often comes at the expense of story nuance and morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Concerns exist for the future of franchises like X-Men, where it is "hard to imagine disney signing off on something as subversive as logan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. As Disney acquires more media, there might be less space for grittier, darker stories, or "grown up fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

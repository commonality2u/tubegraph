The smallest elements in a film can imbue a piece of art with layers of meaning, often saying more in under twenty seconds than other films convey in two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This concept, highlighting [[the_significance_of_film_details | the significance of film details]], is evident in *The Wolf of Wall Street*'s closing shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## The Pen and the Shift in Tone

The final shot of *The Wolf of Wall Street* is a simple push-in and crane-up shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. As a client describes "the pen," his voice is drowned out by solemn music, marking a significant shift from the poppy, upbeat hits that previously underscored the film's debauchery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This sudden change to something more serious and meditative challenges the film's earlier tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

For most of its runtime, the movie revels in Jordan Belfort's excesses—his yacht, women, drugs, and parties—all paid for by defrauding investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While the FBI eventually seizes Belfort's cash and sends him to prison, unlike similar films, *The Wolf of Wall Street* is notably absent of overt moralizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Belfort's prison sentence is portrayed as a cakewalk, and he doesn't even serve his full term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. In the end, "nothing has changed" as Belfort is still selling, and people are still buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Interpretations of the Final Shot

The final shot can be interpreted in several ways, each adding layers of meaning to the film's complex portrayal of excess and morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### 1. A Mirror to the Audience

One interpretation suggests the final shot holds up a mirror to the moviegoers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. A backlight behind the seminar audience evokes a projector shining on the back of a movie audience, implying that the blame for the moral depravity depicted in the film may not solely rest on Jordan Belfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Instead, the shot suggests culpability on the part of the audience and the culture that enables and encourages such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Belfort himself states that people want to get rich quickly and want "something for nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. His scam only works because people share this desire for quick wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Director Martin Scorsese is effectively calling out the audience, who have spent three hours "partying with Jordan, laughing and reveling in his exploits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The lack of punishment for Jordan in the end reflects the audience's vicarious enjoyment of his life and their desire to live it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This perspective aligns with a broader [[critique_of_consumer_capitalism_in_fight_club | critique of consumer capitalism]] and societal values that prioritize material gain.

### 2. The Worship of Money

The scene, with people staring intently at one person and hanging on his every word, draws parallels to religious worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Scorsese, a devout Catholic, often explores faith in his films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. However, in *The Wolf of Wall Street*, characters "worship at the altar of something else: MONEY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The camera focuses on these "painfully average faces"—desperate, plain-looking people seeking meaning and desiring that which can elevate them above their mundane existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Scorsese might be cynically likening the transformative power of faith to the transformative power of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, noting that "The Almighty never promised a million bucks in eight easy steps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### 3. The Voluntary Submission of the Masses

A more sinister interpretation suggests that by solemnly portraying a crowd that worships Jordan despite his detestable actions, Scorsese implies that people actually enjoy being taken advantage of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard's idea of workers enjoying their own "hysterical, masochistic" exhaustion in factories and the "mad destruction of their organic bodies" is cited as a parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

This perspective posits that the closing image indicates the "voluntary submission of the masses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. These individuals not only don't mind white-collar criminals stealing their money but find a "perverse enjoyment" in their banal existence under the heel of figures like Jordan Belfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Conclusion

This single shot is emblematic of *The Wolf of Wall Street*'s complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. As a "true totem of our culture of excess," the film defies easy answers, inviting viewers to question their own complicity and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

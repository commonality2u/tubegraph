In [[summary_of_animal_farm_by_george_orwell | Animal Farm]] by [[characters_and_plot_summary_of_1984 | George Orwell]], Napoleon and Snowball are two prominent pigs who emerge as leaders after the animal rebellion. The pigs, in general, represent the "top dogs of the Communist Party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Initial Leadership and Conflict
After the animals successfully kick Farmer Jones and his boys off Manor Farm and rename it [[animalism_and_rebellion_in_animal_farm | Animal Farm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, Napoleon and Snowball begin "calling the shots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. However, they are constantly "gettin up in each other's grill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, indicating an immediate power struggle between them. They collectively lead the animals in defending the farm when humans attempt to retake it, successfully sending the invaders "packin'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Disagreement and Expulsion
A significant point of contention between Napoleon and Snowball arises over the idea of building a windmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. When the other animals start siding with Snowball on this issue, Napoleon reacts aggressively, chasing Snowball off the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Following Snowball's expulsion, another pig, Squealer, begins telling everyone that Snowball was nothing but a "snitch and a traitor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Allegorical Representations
Napoleon and Snowball serve as direct allegories for key figures in the Russian Revolution and the early Soviet Union:
*   **Napoleon** "stands for Stalin, the Soviet dictator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Snowball** represents "Trotsky, the communist leader who's beef with Stalin got his ass slung out of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The *Dark Souls* series, known for its challenging gameplay and cryptic storytelling, often leaves players baffled by its plot [00:00:31]. Namco even offered $10,000 for a coherent explanation of the story, but attempts have only led to more frustration [00:00:37]. This suggests that perhaps the traditional plot is merely a distraction [00:00:52].

## Cinematic Influence: Michelangelo Antonioni's Approach

The idea of a story deliberately leading nowhere is not uncommon, particularly in avant-garde cinema [00:00:58]. Pioneering Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni frequently employed this technique [00:01:06].

In his film *Blow Up*, the audience is drawn in by a murder mystery, but the murderer and motives are never revealed [00:01:11]. Instead, the plot serves as a distraction from the film's true focus: a character study of a narcissistic artist plagued by ennui [00:01:26]. Similarly, *La Aventura* features a woman who goes missing, but her fate is never disclosed [00:01:32]. The film's actual subject is the hollow decadence of her spoiled friends [00:01:40].

## Hidetaka Miyazaki and Visual Storytelling

Like Antonioni, Hidetaka Miyazaki, the enigmatic director behind *Dark Souls*, creates meaning not through explicit narrative, but through [[visual_storytelling_in_dark_souls | visual design]] [00:01:52]. For instance, the old lady spinning yarn at the beginning of *Dark Souls 2* is a visual reference to the Norns of Norse mythology, who spin the yarns of fate [00:02:04]. While dialogue may lack clarity, it often echoes the game's core themes [00:02:23]. The game prompts players to consider "Is this your TRUE self?" at character creation [00:02:43], suggesting *Dark Souls* is a descent into the unconscious to explore identity and deep desires [00:02:47].

## Philosophical Influence: Sigmund Freud and Psychoanalysis

*Dark Souls* can be analyzed through a [[dark_souls_and_psychoanalysis | psychoanalytic]] lens, particularly drawing on the theories of [[freudian_elements_in_dark_souls | Sigmund Freud]].

### Birth, Rebirth, and the Maternal Womb

The games frequently employ imagery related to birth and the mother's womb, linking to the [[significance_of_birth_and_rebirth_imagery_in_dark_souls | significance of birth and rebirth imagery in Dark Souls]].
*   **Birthing Scenes**: *Dark Souls* begins with a camera plunging into a crevice resembling a vagina, through a tunnel like an ovary, and into a pit resembling a womb filled with "things being born" [00:02:56].
*   *Dark Souls 2* reverses this, starting the player inside a labyrinth of tunnels and caverns, working their way out through a vagina-like crevice into the light [00:03:14].
*   **Womb-like Landscapes**: Throughout the games, landscapes often appear womb or ovary-like [00:03:35]. The essential item "Humanity" in *Dark Souls 1* is deliberately vagina-shaped [00:03:40].
*   **Mother Symbols**: *Dark Souls 2* is full of mother symbols from its start [00:03:49]. Yonic (vagina-like) imagery is common in popular media to implement themes of birth, rebirth, and sex, seen in *Fight Club*, *Rick and Morty*, and *Alien* [00:03:53]. [[philosophical_influences_on_fight_club | Fight Club]] is mentioned as an example of this.
*   **Further Birth Imagery**: Even after escaping the initial "womb," the game continues with themes of birth through:
    *   Mysterious nests and eggs that transport the player [00:04:10].
    *   Demon Ruins covered with egg monsters [00:04:18].
    *   The ability to get infected with an "egg head" [00:04:21].
    *   Encountering pregnant monsters hidden in cells [00:04:24].
    *   *Bloodborne* features themes of bloody birth, screams of pregnant women, and collecting umbilical cord parts [00:04:27]. It concludes with a "bizarre, lovecraftian baby alien," and "blood dregs" suspiciously resembling semen [00:04:35]. The title *Bloodborne* itself hints at these themes [00:04:46].

This "Womb Raiding" motif is unique to *Dark Souls*, connecting to the game's central theme of lost identity and figuring out one's true self [00:05:08]. Freud posited that humans look back to their origins, even to the "primal scene" of parental sex, to understand their complex identities [00:05:28]. The opening line of *Dark Souls 2*, "perhaps you’ve seen it, maybe in a dream. A murky, forgotten land" [00:05:54], frames the game as an endless search for identity by trying to return to this "murky forgotten land" [00:06:02].

### Castration Anxiety and Impotence

Though re-entering the womb is impossible, the games metaphorically depict attempts and subsequent frustrations [00:06:08]. Freud explained that social taboos, often embodied by the "father" figure, prevent access to the mother [00:06:21]. *Dark Souls* mirrors this through:
*   **Phallic Obstructions**: Arched doorways leading to desired areas are often blocked by male guards with "big, erect, throbbing uh… weapons" [00:06:30]. These "castrators" wield large swords, spears, and halberds [00:06:44].
*   **Symbolic Castration**: The boss "The Penetrator" in *Demon's Souls* visually reinforces this theme [00:07:05]. For Freud, swords symbolize castration, representing the father figure threatening to metaphorically "cut off our d*cks" as we try to reach the mother [00:07:11].
*   **The "You Died" Screen**: The frequent appearance of the "You Died" screen, seen an average of 739 times in *Dark Souls 2* [00:07:23], creates a constant feeling of failure and impotence, echoing Freudian castration anxiety [00:07:31]. Being defeated by "giant hulking male giant[s] wielding a formidable phallus" further deflates one's manhood [00:07:52].
*   **Vagina Dentata**: Female enemies like Scorpioness Najka and Mytha the Baneful feature attractive upper halves but "weaponized" bottom halves [00:08:06]. Queen Queelag has monstrous teeth instead of a vagina [00:08:19], symbolizing the "Vagina Dentata"—a mythical concept of a vagina with hidden teeth that decapitate penises [00:08:30]. This imagery visually embodies Freud’s concept of castration anxiety, presenting desire only to attack and symbolically castrate the player, leaving them unfulfilled [00:08:55].

## Philosophical Influence: Jacques Lacan and Unending Desire

The ending of *Dark Souls 2* reverses the birthing scene, with the hero re-entering an "obviously vagina-like door" and being welcomed to "The Throne of Want" by a comforting female voice [00:09:11]. This throne, based on a "kiln" (an oven historically associated with wombs), embodies ultimate desire [00:09:23]. To reach it, the hero must defeat more "penis wielding giant alpha males" [00:09:43].

While the character achieves satisfaction by sitting on the Throne of Want [00:09:47], the player is often left frustrated and unfulfilled [00:09:54]. The "Curse" is not lifted, and a mysterious female voice states "souls will flourish anew and all of this will play out again" [00:10:08]. This aligns with the ideas of Jacques Lacan, a follower of Freud [00:10:27]. Lacan argued that true fulfillment is impossible because desire ceases once an object is attained [00:10:30]. The Ancient Dragon in *Dark Souls 2* directly states this Lacanian argument: "the curse of life is the curse of want," implying endless unfulfillment [00:10:47].

## Dark Souls as a Metaphor for Life

Hidetaka Miyazaki has commented that the *Dark Souls* games explore the "strange crossover between life and death," posing questions like "what is death, and for that matter, what is life?" [00:10:58]. Through this lens, *Dark Souls* can be seen as a metaphor for life itself: development in the womb, birth, endless desire, frustration, misery, confrontation with death, and finally, a return to the peaceful oblivion of the mother's womb [00:11:11]. The game visualizes unconscious desires, complex relationships with birth, and the perpetual struggle for fulfillment with a nightmarish flair [00:11:26].

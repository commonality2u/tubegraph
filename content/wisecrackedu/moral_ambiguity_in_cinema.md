Villains are often considered the best part of a movie, evoking feelings ranging from hatred to empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Lately, there's been a noticeable trend where audiences find themselves nodding along to a diabolical plot's logic or feeling more empathetic than usual towards a film's antagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Modern villains, like Killmonger in *Black Panther* or Screenslaver in *The Incredibles 2*, have become strangely relatable, each presenting cogent critiques of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This shift in villain portrayal reflects changing societal values and fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## From Black and White to Shades of Grey: The 1950s to the 1970s

In the 1950s and early 1960s, American cinema largely depicted a black-and-white world where villains were explicitly evil "others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. These one-dimensional antagonists, whether "bad Russian people," "bad Asian people," or "very bad aliens," embodied an inherent, inexplicable evil intent on destroying American values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

However, the late 1960s and 1970s saw a definitive shift in villain portrayal, coinciding with major social turbulence and soul-searching in America, as issues like the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War exposed societal imperfections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. A startling drop in public trust in government dramatically changed movie villains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

This era began to blur the lines between hero and villain, making distinctions nearly meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Characters were often depicted as conflicted, heavily-flawed protagonists with questionable morals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Villains were increasingly portrayed as individuals struggling to navigate the lines between good and bad, or as villains of circumstance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Examples of this shift include:
*   **Walter White (Breaking Bad)**: Starting as an anti-hero, he gradually morphs into a villain protagonist through ruthless actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Travis Bickle (*Taxi Driver*)**: This character is presented as a "heroic villain, or villainous hero," whose morality swings from violent intent against a presidential candidate to rescuing a child prostitute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Sonny Wortzik (*Dog Day Afternoon*)**: A novice crook who botches a bank robbery and takes hostages. His sympathetic motivation – needing money for his wife's sexual reassignment surgery – reveals him as a "quality dude" not typically involved in crime, challenging traditional villain archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Notably, while this complexity emerged, some popular films like *Star Wars* retained a simpler, black-and-white good vs. evil paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Nuance Amidst Caricature: The 1980s and 1990s

While the 1980s saw a resurgence of cartoonish villains embodying fears like the War on Drugs and the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, there were still hints of the 1970s' skepticism towards institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Villains like Gordon Gekko in *Wall Street* exploited corrupt financial industries for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Hans Gruber in *Die Hard* initially pretends to be a terrorist seeking revenge on an evil corporation, but his moral high ground crumbles when it's revealed he's merely after money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

The 1990s introduced a prime-time for complex anti-villains, reflecting headlines dominated by domestic terrorism and disgruntled middle-class individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. These characters fought small, localized battles through radical means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

*   **Howard Payne (*Speed*)**: A former bomb squad officer turned extortionist, he seeks not only money but also a twisted sense of "meaning" and "purpose" through destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **John Doe (*Se7en*)**: He sees himself as a "chosen" warrior on a crusade against everyday sin, aiming to "set the example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **General Hummel (*The Rock*)**: A disgraced general who holds San Francisco hostage, demanding compensation for the families of slain Marines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This film poses the question of whether noble ends justify violent means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, serving as a prelude to [[moral_dilemmas_and_security_logic_in_apocalyptic_worlds | questions explored by current-day villains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

These villains often felt victimized by the system or circumstance, seeking justice on their own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Sometimes, they even had genuinely noble causes, railing against systems that had wronged them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Nihilism and Systemic Critique: The 2000s and Beyond

The 2000s, shaped by 9/11 and the War on Terror, saw villains embodying an existential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Heath Ledger's Joker in *The Dark Knight* emerged as a salient villain, manifesting as the "spirit of terrorism" and the embodiment of "anarchy and chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The film's themes, particularly the corruption of even the noblest person (Harvey Dent/Two-Face) by such evil, reflected the meaninglessness and nihilism that could emerge from confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

Anton Chigurh in *No Country For Old Men* further exemplified this nihilism, using a coin flip to decide victims' fates without greed or practical goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. He acts as an active nihilist, believing that if all morality is contrived, any method of deciding life or death is equally valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Similarly, Frank Costello in *The Departed* operates under the belief that life is meaningless, excusing any actions that sustain him for another day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

Today's villains are a product of an increasingly divided America, reflecting widespread skepticism towards *all* systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Unlike 1950s villains who infiltrated good systems to corrupt them, contemporary villains often face objectively evil systems they want to change for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. The only thing that makes them villains is their radical and violent means of achieving change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

Modern examples of this [[exploration_of_moral_themes_in_the_show | moral ambiguity]] include:
*   **Killmonger (*Black Panther*)**: He presents a legitimate critique of global treatment of black citizens and Wakanda's passivity. While his means (instigating a militant uprising) are villainous, his radicalism ultimately prompts positive policy changes in Wakanda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **August Walker/John Lark (*Mission Impossible 6*)**: A utilitarian villain who believes that destroying a third of the world will lead to greater peace among the remaining two-thirds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
*   **Thanos (*Infinity War*)**: His goal is to eliminate half the universe's population to solve resource scarcities, a twisted attempt to bring balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Screenslaver (*The Incredibles 2*)**: Her personal beef is with consumable media making people passive observers, and her plan involves discrediting superheroes so people learn to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

These villains appeal to a growing fear that the world is beyond repair and needs to be torn down to be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Audiences can empathize with the villain's critique of the system and desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. In this reinterpretation, heroes are often cast as slightly flawed protectors of an unsatisfactory status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

Contemporary villains merge the complexity of 90s villains with the social critiques of the 70s, while standing in opposition to the nihilism of the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. They believe in a cause worth fighting for, and with different methods, could even be considered complex heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

*American Psycho* has consistently been a lightning rod for controversy since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The book by Bret Easton Ellis was initially abandoned by its publisher due to widespread outcry over its violent depictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. When the film version was released nine years after the book, it became similarly controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Conflicting Interpretations
Much of the controversy surrounding the film version of *American Psycho* stems from differing perceptions of its message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Key questions arise:
*   Is the film a [[critique_of_consumer_capitalism_in_fight_club|critique]] of the consumerism and superficiality of 80s yuppie culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, or does its excess actually glorify this lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>?
*   What is the intended meaning of the film's violence, especially towards women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>? Some label it a feminist masterpiece, while others deem it misogynistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   How should Patrick Bateman be interpreted – as an [[perception_of_patrick_bateman_as_an_antihero|antihero]], a villain, or something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>?

## The Seduction of Bateman's Lifestyle
Despite the film's savage [[parody_and_satire_in_american_psycho|critique]] of consumerism, many find Patrick Bateman's lifestyle undeniably seductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The "Patrick Bateman lifestyle" has permeated culture, with clothing lines, grooming style guides, and even 3D tours of his apartment emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

This phenomenon highlights how [[parody_and_satire_in_american_psycho|parody]] can offer competing interpretations, both legitimizing and subverting its subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. While *American Psycho* contains subversive merits, it also revels in excess, showcasing Bateman's handsomeness, success with women, beautiful apartment, and well-paying job, which are desirable aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Portrayal of Violence
The film often presents Patrick's monstrous acts comedically or cuts away from their direct impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. For instance, Paul Allen's murder is played for comedy with Huey Lewis and The News music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, and Christine's death only shows the aftermath without the moment of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This choice allows the audience to identify more with the "glitz and glamour" of Bateman's life, letting him off the hook for his gruesome deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Critics argue that by indulging in Bateman's lifestyle at the expense of his violence, the film may undermine its own satirical depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## Interpretations of Violence and Misogyny
Many accuse the [[interpretations_of_violence_and_misogyny_in_american_psycho|violence in American Psycho]] of being explicitly targeted towards women and the lower-class, glorifying their grotesque deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Notably, detective Kimball is only concerned with Paul Allen's disappearance, not the numerous women Patrick killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

However, screenwriter Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron offer a different perspective:
> "I very much think American Psycho is a feminist film. It's a satire about how men compete with each other and how in this hyper-real universe we created women are even less important than your tan or your suit or where you summer and to me even though the women are all sort of tragic it's about how men perceive and treat them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. - Guinevere Turner

> "American Psycho is a great parody of masculinity. It's a send-up it was accused of being sexist but to me it was always an attack and satire of sexism and of male ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. - Mary Harron

The film showcases the cavalier attitudes many men have towards women, with Patrick dictating their attire and paying them to follow his instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Bateman believes he can do as he pleases with a woman's body, including killing, mutilating, and even eating them, and the film suggests he largely gets away with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Film's Self-Awareness
Despite its intentions to [[parody_and_satire_in_american_psycho|satirize]] male ego and consumer society, the film's impact often seems to uphold the very surface-value lifestyle it rails against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Patrick Bateman is often lauded as an [[perception_of_patrick_bateman_as_an_antihero|anti-establishment antihero]] despite his monstrous acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

This may be a meta-textual point of the film itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Just as Patrick confesses his crimes to others who mishear him or dismiss his confessions as jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, *American Psycho* the film has been misinterpreted as misogynistic or pro-consumer, or simply treated as a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The issues the film critiques—status-obsessed society, sexism, and wealth inequality—remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. As Patrick Bateman states at the end of the film: "This confession has meant nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The film cynically suggests that its own critique of a society gone "run amok" will also ultimately mean nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

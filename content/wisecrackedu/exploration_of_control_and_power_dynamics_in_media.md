Wisecrack's "media autopsy" format aims to analyze media that "doesn't quite work" to extract lessons from it anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This approach treats the analysis as an "autopsy" or a "participation trophy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The 2016 film *Suicide Squad* is presented as a unique case for this analysis due to its problematic production, where a trailer company was hired to functionally rewrite the movie, resulting in a first 30 minutes that feels like a music video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Thematic Development in Film

A hallmark of a thought-provoking movie is its capacity to introduce and develop a theme through various elements like conflict, characters, and visuals, inspiring thought or feeling in the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

Examples of themes in other films include:
*   Order vs. Chaos in *The Dark Knight* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>
*   Family vs. "The Family" in *The Godfather* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>
*   Truth vs. [[audience_complicity_in_media_narratives | Media Narrative]] in *Gone Girl* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>
*   The merits of punching Nazis in *Captain America* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>

## The Primary Theme of Control in *Suicide Squad*

In *Suicide Squad*, the central theme is control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This theme is explored through multiple character and plot dynamics:

*   **Guard Control**: Guards control and abuse the main characters, who are powerless prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Squad Control**: Amanda Waller and Rick Flag control the Suicide Squad using a device that kills them if they do not comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   **Enchantress Control**: The Enchantress struggles for control over the body of archaeologist June Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Waller's Control**: Amanda Waller controls the Enchantress by threatening her heart and manipulates Rick Flag through his love for June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Monster Control**: The Enchantress controls people by transforming them into "slave monsters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Diablo's Loss of Control**: Diablo accidentally kills his family when he loses control of his powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Joker's Control**: The Joker exerts control over Harley Quinn through their abusive [[relationship_dynamics_and_power_struggles_in_archer | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, with her jacket explicitly stating "Property of The Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Control Across the Snyder DC Universe

The theme of control is recurrent throughout the Snyder DC Universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>:

*   In *Man of Steel*, the question arises of how mankind can maintain control when metahumans with godlike powers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The implied solution is reliance on a benevolent savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   *Batman v Superman* furthers this by asking how mankind maintains order if a powerful benevolent savior turns hostile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, suggesting that certainty of threat, even if small, necessitates action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   *Suicide Squad* enters the narrative by exploring how far humanity must go to maintain control now that Earth's metahuman "bodyguard" is dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. If *Batman v Superman* examined god-like beings wielding overwhelming power, *Suicide Squad* should explore the ramifications of humans wielding overwhelming power against god-like beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Amanda Waller and the Divine Analogy

The film further explores this dynamic through the character of Amanda Waller, who is twice compared to divine figures (God and the Devil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. This draws a parallel to Lex Luthor's painting in *Batman v Superman*, which depicts Satan as a fallen angel, implying Superman's potential for evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. This raises the question of whether Waller, a government official, will "fall" like Satan in her quest for control, pushing it too far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Unfulfilled Thematic Potential

*Suicide Squad* sets up a thematic conflict between tyrannical control (perhaps necessary against existential threats, like in *The Dark Knight*) and the idea that oppression is inherently evil (as in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. However, the film fails to develop either perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

As an anti-superhero movie, it initially encourages identification with the oppressed prisoners, highlighting their humanity (daughters, regrets, victims of emotional abuse) while showing the lack of humanity in those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Even the Enchantress is presented as a victim of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. This setup allows for thematic interplay regarding whether the audience should identify with Enchantress given her victimhood, similar to the Squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

However, the film ultimately abandons this nuanced exploration of moral gray areas by reverting Enchantress to a "bland, evil villain" with a vague motivation to destroy the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. This choice undermines the film's potential to ask interesting questions about the characterization of evil when protagonists, antagonists, and those in power are all "bad guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. Instead of dancing around insight, the film throws out all nuance, lazily labeling evil as simply "the thing that wants to destroy the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

This simplification robs the themes of control and oppression of any meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. The film neither supports the idea that oppressive power is necessary (since the Squad defeats Enchantress on their own accord) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>, nor does it suggest oppressive power is evil (as Waller effectively wins and her corrupt status quo is reinstated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Ultimately, those under control generally suffer: Enchantress dies, Diablo dies, the Squad returns to prison, and Harley Quinn remains subjugated by the Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. The film becomes about "subjugated people defending their own imprisonment" against another victim of control, rather than articulating a clear stance on freedom or necessary evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

### Joker's Cryptic Line and Harley Quinn's Arc

Jared Leto's Joker's role is largely seen as purposeless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. However, one line contributes to the thematic discussion: "Desire becomes surrender, surrender becomes power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This manifests when Enchantress attempts to gain power over the Squad by showing them their desires, prompting them to surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

There are hints that the writer intended an arc for Harley Quinn related to desire, surrender, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Initially, she submits to desire, allowing the Joker to dominate her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. At the end, she rejects Enchantress's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. However, this is not a lasting lesson for Harley, as she quickly returns to the Joker's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. This prevents the line from meaningfully developing the theme of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Suicide Squad* contains "a spark of intelligence" that suggests earlier, more effective versions of the film may have existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. Ultimately, the film presents a thematic setup rich with potential moral conundrums regarding control and oppression, but it fails to develop these complexities, instead defaulting to generic superhero tropes that undermine its own premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.

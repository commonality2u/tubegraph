Self-aware humor is prevalent in media like *Deadpool*, *Cabin in the Woods*, and *Galaxy Quest*, which poke fun at the genres they inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This growing trend of media making fun of itself necessitates understanding the complex nature of self-criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. A key to this understanding is the distinction between satire and parody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Both exist to criticize the world, but they do so in fundamentally different ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This article explores these differences using [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] and *One-Punch Man* as prime examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Shared Characteristics: Twisting Archetypes and Exploring Power

Both *One-Punch Man* and [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] share a willingness to take genre archetypes and twist them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **One-Punch Man:** Distorts anime tropes like magical girls (e.g., Sailor Moon) with a "swole ex-convict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, portrays the hardworking everyman hero as a "debuffed version" of Toku Hero Kamen Rider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, and depicts a Goku-esque world savior as a "low rent Halloween costume attached to an egg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **[[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]]:** Features an "army of superhero knock-offs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Rorschach and Ozymandias distill elements of Batman: Ozymandias as the charismatic, rich, and hyper-intelligent Bruce Wayne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, and Rorschach as the detective Batman, whose quest for truth and justice veers into obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Nite Owl is a recreation of the nerdy inventor version of Batman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Both narratives use these altered characters to observe what is taken for granted in superhero stories: the types of heroes, expected actions, and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This contrast explores a more "realistic version of superhero power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### The Boredom of Omnipotence

Both Saitama (from *One-Punch Man*) and Dr. Manhattan (from [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]]) confront the boredom that comes with omnipotence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

*   Saitama mourns his lack of a true challenge, easily defeating enemies with a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   Dr. Manhattan spends his time on Mars, contemplating time and engaging in "weird sex," finding Earth and its people tiresome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Unlike traditional protagonists such as Batman or Goku, neither Saitama nor Dr. Manhattan struggles in a conventional sense; physical confrontations are over before they begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Satire: Attacking Vice and Subverting Genre

The critical difference between *One-Punch Man* and [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] lies in their method: [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] is a satire, while *One-Punch Man* is a parody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

According to Dustin Griffin in ‘Satire: A Critical Reintroduction,’ a work of satire is "designed to attack vice or folly," aiming to persuade an audience that "something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. When satire adopts another literary structure, it doesn't just borrow it, but "subvert[s] it or... direct[s] it's energies towards alien ends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] as Satire

[[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] goes beyond attacking societal vices and superhero genre follies; it specifically assaults the very idea of individuals possessing powers akin to nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

*   **Nuclear Fear:** The narrative is largely about nuclear fear, symbolized by Dr. Manhattan, who gains his powers in a nuclear accident and is used as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. His name is a direct reference to the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Clocks counting down to "undesirable outcomes" and constant references to nuclear security highlight this theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Even international conflicts and domestic riots return to the fear of a nuclear threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Dangers of Power:** [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] exposes the dangers and indifference of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Dr. Manhattan's boredom with everything leads to conflict over his own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. It's a "grim joke about Superman": if he were truly omnipotent, why would he care for humanity? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> Dr. Manhattan's choice to be naked symbolizes his stripping away of ideology, contrasting with Superman's costume evoking American values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Corrupting Influence:** The Comedian exemplifies the corrupting influence of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Although a hyper-capable super-soldier like Captain America or Wolverine, he is also a sadist and psychopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] points out that those with power are not necessarily deserving of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

[[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] uses the superhero genre's form (Batman clones, all-powerful beings) and content to persuade its audience that the very idea of superheroes is a "dangerous fantasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Analogous to Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal" which satirized societal indifference to suffering by suggesting eating children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] uses the superhero narrative to make superheroes "look dangerous and shitty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. It argues that superheroes create an unregulated asymmetry of power, leading to dangerous conflicts when different ethical frameworks collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Ultimately, [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]] condemns superhero fiction for promoting a dangerous fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Parody: Exaggerating to Affirm and Improve

*One-Punch Man* is a parody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. While it exaggerates certain elements of its target, parody ultimately "affirms the literary form it inhabits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Robert Phiddian, in "Are Parody and Deconstruction Secretly The Same Thing?", states that parody "operates from inside of the texts and ideas it criticizes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### *One-Punch Man* as Parody

*One-Punch Man* pokes fun at both manga and Western comic superheroes and their genres, featuring intentionally over-the-top villain monologues and characters with dramatic backstories and fighting spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. It engages with classic anime and manga tropes, but "without the judgement we see in [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

*   **Affirmation through Exaggeration:** The show's creators clearly love the genre despite ridiculing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This is demonstrated by exaggerating the overpowered hero archetype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. While characters like Goku in *Dragon Ball Z* always get stronger to match villains, *One-Punch Man* questions the necessity of other characters when Saitama can defeat anyone with a single punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Critique for Improvement:** *One-Punch Man* critiques superhero stories by "showing... precisely where they double and collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Mumen Rider, despite a heroic motivation, constantly gets beaten, a message about some people not having what it takes to be a superhero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Saitama's boredom after saving the world intrudes on the typical happy ending, highlighting that unchecked power can lead to a lack of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Expanding Possibilities:** Parody aims to "awaken us to the flaws in the things we love, but not to demolish a flawed genre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. *One-Punch Man* mocks anime to expand its possibilities, urging creators to move beyond the "bigger monster, bigger gun" model and tell diverse stories about everyday professions like chefs, ice skaters, and mahjong players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The show's ending criticizes the *Dragon Ball Z* model of storytelling, displaying how the "infinite power model can fail" through both Boros's destructive quest for challenge and Saitama's boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

Crucially, *One-Punch Man* critiques a specific type of superhero narrative but does not "disavow the value of heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. It encourages recognizing the bravery of characters like Genos and Mumen Rider, while also acknowledging the "silliness of the story we find those lessons in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## Conclusion: Condemnation vs. Improvement

The fundamental distinction between satire and parody lies in their ultimate goals:

*   **Satire (e.g., [[watchmen_as_a_satirical_work | Watchmen]]):** Makes condemnations of social systems beyond the context of superheroes and even condemns the superhero genre itself, aiming to prove something is "reprehensible or ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Parody (e.g., *One-Punch Man*):** Seeks to refresh and improve stories within a genre, operating on the assumption that the genre is "worth improving," rather than abandoning it completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

Examples of satire include *Team America*, *Dr. Strangelove*, and *Heathers* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Examples of parody include *Deadpool*, *Galaxy Quest*, and *Blazing Saddles* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

Ari Aster's 2019 film *Midsommar* explores profound themes of community and belonging, contrasting the isolating nature of modern secular society with the intense, albeit terrifying, communal bonds of a traditional cult. Director Ari Aster's follow-up to his 2018 film *Hereditary* was described by Jordan Peele as "the most idyllic horror film of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, prompting questions about its deeper meaning beyond the shocking imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Dany's Isolation in Modern Society

At the outset of *Midsommar*, the protagonist Dany is depicted as firmly entrenched in a cold, alienating secular society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. Her world is characterized by "icy lonely city streets" and muted colors, conveying a sense that it is "not a happy world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

Following the tragic loss of her entire family, Dany receives little genuine comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Her boyfriend, Christian, only remains with her out of guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, inviting her to Sweden unenthusiastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Dany's life appears devoid of true community and emotional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. She is often shown alone in her house, with phone calls serving as her primary communication with the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. A notable scene features the camera solely on Dany's face during a call with Christian, implying his emotional distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Other conversations occur in mirrors, suggesting a lack of genuine connection and a focus on superficial interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

Christian's disengagement is further highlighted by his constant attempts to evade her, forgetting her birthday, and pressuring her to use hallucinogens despite her panic attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. Their Swedish friend, Pelle, observes Dany's lacking state, noting that despite being orphaned, he has "always felt held by a family, a real family which everyone deserves. You deserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. This emphasizes Dany's need for love, empathy, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## The Hårga: A Cult of Unison and Empathy

The Hårga community, though terrifying in its rituals, offers Dany the very things her secular life lacks: love, empathy, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Dany, initially wary and frightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>, is gradually "seduced by the warmth of their community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

A key aspect of the Hårga is their profound sense of collective identity. They move and behave "in tandem," as if "dancing to the same piece of choreography" and operating as "different parts of the same organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This manifests as a "shared catharsis both in pain and pleasure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. For instance, when an elder survives a cliff jump, the tribe moans in unison, "as if experiencing a collective pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. Similarly, during Christian's sex ritual, the Hårga women "moan in unison with Maya as if sharing her pleasure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. Ari Aster himself notes that "their language is empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

## Dany's Immersion and Transformation

Dany's journey into the Hårga culture is a central part of the film. Initially "intimidated by their sense of unity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>, she nonetheless appears "struck by the connectedness of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. After witnessing the initial shocking sacrifices, Dany, though "visibly stunned and devastated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>, listens intently to an elder explain their view of life "as a circle, a recycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>—a concept of rebirth that appeals to someone who has lost her entire family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.

Her increasing immersion is visually represented through her costume changes, transitioning from "dark real world clothing to an apron and eventually a full dress and flower wreath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. During the maypole dance, she takes hallucinogens in a ritualized motion, sharing the experience with the Hårga girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Though "slightly off rhythm," she is drawn into the dance, and for the first time, she genuinely smiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>, finally moving "as part of the singular Harga organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

The pivotal moment of Dany's transformation occurs after she sees Christian's infidelity. Her uncontrollable tears are met not with the isolation of her past, but with a group of Hårga women crying in tandem with her, "as if sharing her emotional load and completely empathizing with her pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

Dany's growing "inculcation into the cult is mirrored by her increased immersion into nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. This is shown psychedelically through hallucinations of her hands and feet turning into grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. As May Queen, she becomes increasingly adorned with flowers, eventually seeming to "disappear into a gown and crown of bright blossoms," symbolizing her "surrender to nature and this agrarian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

Her complete fidelity to the Hårga is cemented when she chooses Christian as the final sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. Watching him burn, Dany experiences pain but also joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>, as "the vestiges of her former life crumble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>, freeing her to embrace a new community where she can "belong and be seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

## Outsider Perspective: Christian and the Dude Bros

In stark contrast to Dany's journey, Christian and his friends approach the Hårga with a "condescending distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>, viewing them as anthropology students studying a subject for a thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. They sneak into temples for photos of texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a> and observe rituals as if "surveilling animals at a zoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. Mark, one of the friends, embodies this detachment, being more interested in "banging Swedish chicks" and showing disrespect by urinating on a sacred tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

Their perspective mirrors that of an audience "alienated from the value of ancient rituals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>, willing to accept the horrific nature of these traditions for the sake of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

## [Modern secular perspectives versus traditional rituals in Midsommar | Ritual as Community Building]

The film constantly plays into and subverts modern society's aversion to mystical traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. The choice of "very religious Swedes" as the film's "boogeyman" instead of a serial killer or clown "speaks volumes about our society's fear and aversion to ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. However, Aster simultaneously portrays the Hårga as the solution to Dany's problems, offering her "complete acceptance, genuine reciprocity, and total empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. *Midsommar* thus serves as a "shocking reassertion of the value of ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. Despite their apparent irrationality, these acts serve the rational purpose of building community and a sense of belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

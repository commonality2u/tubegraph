[[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | Alan Moore]], author of acclaimed comics like *Watchmen*, *Miracleman*, and *The Killing Joke*, identifies himself as a ritual magician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He views magic not as pulling rabbits from hats, but in the vein of a "Steven Strange variety" who consults grimoires and conjures demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While this might initially sound like superstition, Moore presents a fascinating philosophy of magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Hermeticism: The Foundation of Moore's Magic

Moore's understanding of magic is deeply rooted in Hermeticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Hermeticism is a tradition focused on seeking understanding of the world through a set of interrelated practices and principles, rather than fixed doctrines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Its core methods include:
*   [[the_role_of_alchemy_as_a_scientific_method | Alchemy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   Astrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   Theurgy: The process of achieving spiritual perfection to grow closer to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>

Hermetic teachings are largely based on the *Corpus Hermeticum* by the mythical Hermes Trismegistus, a blend of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, both deities of Language and Wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. For Moore, this combination of language and understanding is the essence of magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Defining Magic

In his upcoming work, *The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic*, Moore defines magic as "a purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. He posits that reality can be divided into two categories:
*   **The Material**: Physical elements like matter, energy, space, time, and fundamental forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. We never experience these directly; our brains create a mental model based on limited sensory information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **The Immaterial**: The mental model of the external world formed by our brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Magic, for Moore, is the bridge between these two realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## The Interplay of Material and Immaterial

Moore illustrates this bridge using examples from his own work:
*   In [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | *Watchmen*]], Moore's initial intangible idea was given form by artist Dave Gibbons, physically altering the arrangement of atoms to become the comic book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Conversely, merely mentioning [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Doctor Manhattan]]'s appearance can conjure an image in a reader's mind, demonstrating how physical sound (material) alters [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | perception]] (immaterial), akin to casting a spell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Moore emphasizes that [[the_intersection_of_art_language_and_consciousness_in_moores_works | art, language, and symbols]] are the "real wizard's wands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. He states that "magic is intrinsically connected with art, language and consciousness to the point where these four things almost become different aspects of the same phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   The rabbit-duck illusion serves as another example: an initial mental interpretation as "duck" can be changed to "rabbit" simply by someone telling you it's also a rabbit, demonstrating how storytelling can alter [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | perception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Storytelling as Spell-Craft

Storytelling acts as "spell-craft" to cast or dispel illusions:
*   In *Miracleman*, the titular character aims to create a utopia and abolishes money, arguing that "Money’s imaginary. Real if we believe in it…" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. By changing collective belief, the *Miracleman* story attempts to alter a fundamental societal structure.
*   [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | *Promethea*]] clearly demonstrates this method of magically altering something by changing thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. In a rematch with the demon-king Asmodeus, protagonist Sophie and her companions defeat him by accepting that demons are part of human nature, transforming Asmodeus's appearance into a human one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Asmodeus explains, "Approach us with fear, with hatred and revulsion, and we will be fearsome, hateful, and vile. Approach us humanely and with respect, and we will be human and respectable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. For the magician, "expectation creates perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Doctor Manhattan]]'s physical appearance in [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | *Watchmen*]] as an "ageless aquamarine Adonis with alopecia" is a direct result of how he internally perceives himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Hermetic Principles in Practice

Moore extensively applies two key Hermetic principles in his works:

### Macrocosm and Microcosm ("As Above, So Below")
This principle suggests that every level of reality reflects every other, like an infinite fractal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Understanding one part of the pattern allows for better comprehension of the whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. In [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | *Promethea*]], the entire series' structure is based on the Kabbalah's Tree of Life, which repeats at both macrocosmic (entirety of existence) and microcosmic (individual soul) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   The Tree of Life represents a roadmap to reality, including inner lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   Its levels include perception, imagination, art and language, and capacities for emotion and reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Macroscopically, it spans from the physical universe to the collective unconscious, culminating in "The All. The One. God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | *Promethea*]] comprises thirty-two issues, corresponding to the ten Spheres and twenty-two Paths of the Tree of Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The final issue itself is a microcosm of the series, demonstrating "As above, so below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Solve et Coagula ("Separate and Combine")
This principle involves breaking a thing down into its component parts to understand how the whole fits together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   [[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | Doctor Manhattan]]'s arc in [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | *Watchmen*]] exemplifies *Solve et Coagula* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Initially, he detaches from humanity by mentally breaking humans into "base components" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. His breakthrough on Mars is learning to conceptually recombine and perceive them as holistic four-dimensional objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   In [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | *Promethea*]] issue six, Sophie defeats the writer Marto Neptura by understanding that he is a collective pen name of various novelists, "cut down to his separate unique styles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## The World's End and Jerusalem

Moore believes that a sufficiently complete story, capable of changing the [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | perception]] of an entire species, could lead to "the World's end" – the end of a collective way of viewing the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. In [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | *Promethea*]], Sophie brings about the Apocalypse by explaining Hermetic principles to everyone, causing them to perceive material and immaterial worlds as equally "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This is likened to a "Devonian leap from sea to land," from matter to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

Moore predicted a similar "end of the world as we know it" for 2017, due to an exponential increase in knowledge that would necessitate new ways of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. To herald this, in 2016, he released his magnum opus, [[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | *Jerusalem*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Moore describes [[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | *Jerusalem*]] as a "ten-year ritual working" intended to have a "beneficial effect upon the consciousness of its readership," his most sophisticated and ambitious magical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Language and Perception in Jerusalem

[[alan_moores_influence_on_comics_and_the_significance_of_his_works_like_jerusalem | *Jerusalem*]] is crafted to allow the reader to experience higher states of consciousness as they are described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   One chapter, told from the perspective of Lucia Joyce, uses a linguistic style akin to *Finnegans Wake* to replicate her condition, exploring how "insanity" might bring one closer to perceiving external reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Doctor Manhattan]]'s simultaneous perception of all moments in his life in [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | *Watchmen*]] is presented by Moore as a more "sane" [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | perception]] than the "stubbornly persistent illusion" of linear time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   Moore applies *Solve et Coagula* to language itself, separating phonetics (how words sound) from graphetics (how words appear) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. He uses "gibberish" dialogue that, when read phonetically, makes sense, but also contains double-entendres (e.g., "dimension" resembling "dementia," "universe" resembling "loony") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This forces the reader to perceive multiple layers of meaning, mirroring the multi-dimensional nature of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Conclusion: Magic and Imagination

While Moore's prophesied revelation for 2017 did not manifest as a physical "end of the world," his influence as a writer is expected to endure for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. For Moore, magic is as real as imagination itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. [[the_concept_of_reality_and_perception_in_promethea_and_watchmen | Promethea]]'s Revelation highlights this idea: "I’m an idea, but I’m a real idea. I’m the idea of human imagination, which, when you think about it, is the only thing we can really be certain isn’t imaginary… Everything in it started out in human imagination. Your lives, your personalities, your whole world. All invented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

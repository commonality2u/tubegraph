The *Saw* franchise explores the idea that suffering can be a catalyst for ethical self-understanding and personal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Jigsaw, the antagonist, designs torturous games as opportunities for his victims to repent for their sins and ostensibly become better human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. He believes that if they survive his tests, they will emerge with a newfound ability to appreciate life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Jigsaw's Philosophy and Early Christian Thought

John Kramer, alias Jigsaw, develops his moral code after a series of personal tragedies, including his wife's miscarriage and his own terminal cancer diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Surviving a suicide attempt, he becomes convinced of a new calling: dispensing morality through torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

His philosophy appears inspired by early Christian views on suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Early Christian theologians grappled with how an all-good God could create suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. They rationalized it as the fault of sinful humans, stemming from the Original Sin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Suffering and repentance were deemed necessary for reunion with God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

Jigsaw similarly believes his victims deserve the suffering they endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. He holds them accountable for their past immorality, viewing them as enslaved by their sins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. The character of Cecil Adams, responsible for Jill's miscarriage, is presented as an "original sin" catalyst for John's transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Another victim, Adam Stanheight, a photographer who spies on people, mirrors the biblical Adam's desire for "knowledge" from the Tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## Kierkegaard and Personal Responsibility

Jigsaw also shares a common thread with [[kierkegaard_and_personal_responsibility | Soren Kierkegaard]], a Christian theorist and father of Existentialism, who saw suffering as a critical part of personal and spiritual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Like Kramer, Kierkegaard experienced significant hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Both believed that suffering purifies the sufferer, teaches them to appreciate life, and forces them to take responsibility for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

Kierkegaard proposed three distinct phases an individual must pass through to become their "true self":
1.  **The Aesthetic** Driven by sensual pleasures and lacking morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
2.  **The Ethical** Driven by morality and belief in individual responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
3.  **The Religious** Driven by faith in God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

According to Kierkegaard, suffering is key to moving from the aesthetic to the ethical stage of human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. While Kierkegaard focused on spiritual and existential suffering, Jigsaw's torture machines can be understood as tests for his victims, typically aesthetes driven by desires for sex, drugs, or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. His tests present ethical quandaries that force painful decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

## The Process of Ethical Self-Understanding

Suffering, according to Kierkegaard, compels reflection, leading to "the first doubt" â€“ the thought, "Why is this happening to me; can it not be otherwise?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This moment generates a desire to change one's circumstance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, opening the individual to "ethical self-understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. Suffering "turns the single individual over to himself completely," forcing repentance, responsibility for guilt, and the choice to seek survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

As one progresses, a "false self" dies, making room for recreation into a better, truer self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. This concept aligns with the idea of [[toxic_selves_as_a_narrative_device | toxic selves as a narrative device]] in storytelling. John Kramer experienced this himself after his car crash, feeling "a different person crawled out through the wreckage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Jigsaw demands this "death" of the old self from his follower, Amanda, in a scene that fans call "Amanda's baptism," symbolizing spiritual cleansing and rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Jigsaw frequently references this concept of rebirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

Central to this transformation is personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. Kierkegaard stated that becoming "a real man" involves becoming a "responsible individual before God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Kramer demands the same from his victims, emphasizing the importance of making a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Kierkegaard believed that in the moment of making a choice, a man "becomes himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. Kramer insists his victims "choose" their actions and are responsible for the outcome of their decisions within his games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

## Critique of Jigsaw's Moral Code

Despite his intentions, Jigsaw's attempt to establish a moral order fails to bring about meaningful change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. Most victims fail their tests or are traumatized if they survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. His apprentices twist his philosophy, creating unwinnable death traps for revenge rather than renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. The series ultimately critiques this extreme version of traditional Christian morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>, showing Jigsaw as a "seriously failed" God-like figure whose justice is not dispensed fairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. His own death is a result of one of his tests' ultimate failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

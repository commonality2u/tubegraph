*Attack on Titan* is a colossal series that explores various dark elements, including the visceral reality of [[exploration_of_death_in_attack_on_titan | death]] and the horrifying construction of society behind its walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The show's anachronistic quasi-Germanic society exhibits similarities to German history, particularly aligning its political ideology with the beliefs of the notorious Nazi philosopher, [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The series can be understood as an exploration of Schmitt's ideas, presenting a society that maintains stability against a horrific enemy by reflecting Nazi ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Carl Schmitt's "The Political"

Central to [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt's]] philosophy and the civilization in *Attack on Titan* is the concept of "the political" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For Schmitt, a stable society is built upon three concepts: conflict and inequality, clear distinctions between friends and enemies, and sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Schmitt's first point is that conflict, division, and [[social_inequality_and_class_structure_in_attack_on_titan | inequality]] are inevitable among humans, rooted in an understanding of humanity's savage and hellish basic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This aligns with philosopher Thomas Hobbes's view that humanity is inherently monstrous, requiring social structures to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For Schmitt, hostility is unavoidable, and inequality, stemming from differences in intelligence, fitness, or attractiveness, is not politics' role to fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Instead, a strong sovereign should focus on maintaining order and control, as attempting to eliminate antagonism or inequality is futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## The Titans as the "Enemy"

Schmitt's second element of "the political" emphasizes the necessity of a clear distinction between friend and enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Good governments, according to Schmitt, need an enemy to struggle against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Without a clear enemy, human nature drives societies toward an unending civil war, marked by war crimes and self-eradication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The existence of a common enemy impedes constant internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

In *Attack on Titan*, the Titans serve as this external enemy, providing a check against total conquest beyond the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Characters like Erwin and Pyxis acknowledge the necessity of the Titans as the enemy, worrying that without them, humanity itself would become the real threat, as the Titans merely keep people in line and provide a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### The Role of a Fabricated Enemy

The show suggests the possibility that the Titans could be a government-fabricated enemyâ€”a "Schmitt-ean wet dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. If rogue Titans are part of an inside conspiracy, they serve as an intelligent, strong, naked enemy that keeps humanity from fighting each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This interpretation could also function as a criticism of Schmitt's politics, presenting the Titans as an allegory for a perfect scapegoat that mobilizes the population and empowers those in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Nationalism and Community

The focus on nationalism and survival, which Schmitt views as crucial, is evident in *Attack on Titan*'s first season theme song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Its lyrics evoke a nationalistic propaganda similar to a post-World War I German rallying cry, emphasizing fighting past defeat and the will to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Freedom and community, for Schmitt, are defined by denying cowardice in the face of impending [[exploration_of_death_in_attack_on_titan | death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Joining the Scouts is depicted as a liberation from the fear of living inside the walls waiting to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This desire to join the Scouts cements Eren's class as a political community, giving life purpose through the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. For Schmitt, a political community is defined by the ability to kill enemies for friends or die at the hands of enemies for friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This camaraderie is what binds humanity together, preventing internal strife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## The Blurring of the Friend-Enemy Line

As *Attack on Titan* progresses, the friend-enemy distinction becomes blurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The revelation that Eren and Annie are Titans erodes the clear lines between a foreign enemy and a domestic friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The scene where Eren partially transforms to save Mikasa and Armin from cannon fire is crucial, as it illustrates the consequences when the division between human and Titan blurs, making the task of securing the population nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Implications and Debate

The series prompts contemplation on the consequences if the Titans were to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Would society descend into anarchy or civil war within the walls, or would it lead to liberation and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>? For Schmitt, eradicating an enemy is not a viable option because the drive for warfare and the search for another enemy are constant, potentially leading to self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

It is important to be wary of [[nazi_ideology_and_carl_schmitts_influence_on_attack_on_titan | Carl Schmitt's]] warnings about unending war, given his role as a principal theorist for the Nazi Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Despite this, there remains robust academic debate about the redeemability and utility of Schmitt's work in understanding international conflict, executive power, and contemporary issues like the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. *Attack on Titan* has the potential to either become a scathing criticism of Schmitt-style politics or to merely complicate them as the narrative unfolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

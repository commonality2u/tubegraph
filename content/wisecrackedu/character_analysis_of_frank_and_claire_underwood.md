Frank and Claire Underwood are a power couple whose quest for power and the American presidency drives the narrative of *House of Cards* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Their pursuit of the presidency comes "at any cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The show rejects the idea of a morally righteous character triumphing over a broken government, instead showcasing a process where raw power and cunning consistently win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Frank Underwood: The Master Performer

Frank Underwood's character is deeply intertwined with themes of aesthetics, theater, and the nature of politics.

### Politics as Performance
In the cynical world of *House of Cards*, Frank constantly maintains an image, both publicly and privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. His actions are often deliberate performances, such as visiting his father to "seem more human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. He uses theatrical devices like soliloquies and asides, heavily influenced by William Shakespeare, to explicate his inner thoughts to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This breaking of the fourth wall blurs the distinction between the show, reality, and politics as theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Frank leverages media sensationalism and political spectacle:
*   He destroys Michael Kern’s career over an op-ed Kern didn't write <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   He fabricates a brick through his window to symbolize a stance against "out of control teachers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   He uses catchphrases and slogans like "America Works!" to replace genuine political argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Appearance as Reality
Frank embodies German philosopher Hannah Arendt's concept that "appearance... constitutes reality" in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. He states, "We are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This perspective implies that for Frank, there is no underlying authentic reality separate from his presented appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Frank's "lack of sincerity and frequent use of deception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> makes him a hypocrite, a term derived from the Ancient Greek word for playacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. He admits, "The road to power is paved with hypocrisy... and causalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Frank's seemingly ever-changing identity prevents viewers from hating him, as he appears as a:
*   Sometimes good husband to Claire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   Manipulative murderer to Zoe Barnes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   Kind boss and one-time lover to Meechum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   Supportive friend to Freddy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   Job creator for the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   "Two-timing liar to... well everybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Motivation: Power and Legacy
What drives Frank Underwood is simply power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. He views power as superior to money: "Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years. Power is the old stone building that stands for centuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. His ultimate goal is to build a lasting legacy, striving for immortality through his deeds, akin to a work of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Frank's disdain for the Buddhist monks' sand mandala, which symbolizes the fleeting nature of existence, highlights his obsession with permanence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. His civil war diorama, initially a way to memorialize his ancestors, is ultimately destroyed, representing the transient nature of his own achievements, including his presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Claire Underwood: The Search for Authenticity

Claire's [[Character analysis of Frank and Claire Underwood | character portrayal]] suggests she is different from Frank, potentially having "something behind the mask" that she inhibits for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Aesthetics and Suppression
Claire's appearance is meticulously curated, with her wardrobe frequently dialogued about and featured in fashion listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, this aesthetic façade often conceals her true feelings. For instance, upon hearing of Zoe Barnes' death, Claire immediately applies makeup, symbolizing how aesthetics suppress her disgust at Frank's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### Yearning for Authenticity and Legacy
Unlike Frank, Claire does not detest the impermanent sand mandala, and its destruction foreshadows her departure from Frank, indicating her acknowledgment that nothing, not even her marriage, is permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. She seeks authenticity through art forms like photography and origami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Her relationship with the photographer hints at her seduction by a genuine bohemian lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

Claire struggles with her own legacy, often discarding her political ambitions (like CWI) and her desire to have children in pursuit of Frank's quest for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. When a homeless person rejects money—a symbol of the Underwoods' power—and turns it into origami, Claire is confronted with her choice of "power and wealth over creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. She subsequently takes up origami, symbolizing her desire to create a legacy through family rather than power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

The *Rick and Morty* Season 3 episode "The Ricklantis Mixup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> delves into a complex and dismal political world, using its narratives to explore themes of hope, resistance, and revolution in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The episode suggests that any form of political or personal optimism for change is ultimately crushed by a cruel and indifferent reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Alienation and the System

The episode builds upon [[philosophical_themes_in_postapocalyptic_fiction | themes of alienation]] previously explored in "Rickmancing the Stone," where modern society estranges individuals from the world and their peers, leaving them feeling "dead inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The Citadel of Ricks depicts various versions of the "smartest man in the universe" reduced to the drudgery of modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Even the ruling class of Ricks are portrayed as victims of this alienation, having been told they were special but then stripped of their uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Police officers are likened to "working stiff Ricks" on an "assembly line of justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, highlighting how individuals are victims not just of those in power, but of an impenetrable system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Commodified Escapism: The Simple Rick Trope

A central philosophical question posed by the episode is whether escaping the alienation of modern life merely strengthens the foundations of the system that drives that alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This idea is exemplified by "Simple Rick," a Rick whose happiest memory – the love for his daughter – is captured and perpetually looped to secrete a chemical for "Simple Rick Simple Wafers Wafer Cookie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. These wafers promise the "impossible flavor of your own completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

This concept mirrors the "Ron Swanson trope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, where individuals try to counter the fast-paced, urban world by slowing down, working with their hands, and spending time with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The episode argues that this "simple life" escape, whether through nature, family, or trade, is not a retreat from the system but an essential part of its functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The "Simple Rick wafers" brand represents a fantasy that reinforces the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Ricks show up for work knowing they can "unplug" with the distilled essence of simplicity, even though this "unplugging" is itself a commodity requiring money earned through the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Sociologist George Ritzer's ideas are referenced, suggesting that the enchantment with and disenchantment from the modern world are indistinguishable and exist in a reciprocal relation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The fantasy of unplugging with Simple Rick Wafers further entrenches individuals in the very system they seek to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Commodified Rebellion: The Illusion of Freedom

The philosophical exploration deepens when a Rick, fed up with his life, rebels by killing his boss and attempting to use a portal gun to truly escape the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. However, instead of effecting change, his rebellion is commodified into "Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects," which promise the "unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This portrays how the system can distill even the joy of rebellion into a consumable form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, asserting that "freedom from the system entraps you in the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Ritzer's concept that "fantasies draw people into the new means of consumption, and those fantasies can be rationalized in order to further draw people in" is cited to explain this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### The Futility of Hope

The episode's darkest message is that in a terrifying political reality, the best one can hope for is the illusion of making a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The orphan Morty's subplot exemplifies this: their coming-of-age adventure ends with their "wish portal" being a "garbage portal," symbolizing that the system turns wishes into literal trash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Slick Morty's sacrifice for a better world appears to work, but this change is ultimately revealed to be a ploy by Evil Morty, having no actual bearing on the overall narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The subplot serves to show the naivety of children believing their actions can change something, concluding that "nothing they did mattered, but they get to believe it did, just like our revolting Rick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

Ultimately, "The Ricklantis Mixup" paints a bleak picture where both escapism and rebellion are co-opted and commodified, leaving individuals trapped within the very system they seek to transcend.

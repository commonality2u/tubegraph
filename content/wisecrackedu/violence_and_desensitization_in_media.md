The film *The Purge* explores themes related to the impact of legalized violence and its effect on society and individual psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Set in the 21st century, the film posits a future where the government legalizes murder for half a day once a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Purge's Hypothesis and Rebuttal

Initially, *The Purge* suggests that engaging in and consuming violence could relieve a person's desire for extreme behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, the film quickly undermines this premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. It concludes that such engagement will simply [[trivialization_of_violence_and_traditional_gangster_tropes | desensitize]] people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> and lead to even more violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Trivialization of Violence

The film uses artistic choices to highlight the [[trivialization_of_violence_and_traditional_gangster_tropes | desensitization to violence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>:
*   Brutal images of murder are juxtaposed with classical music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   This juxtaposition underlines the idea that violence has ceased to shock and horrify, becoming mundane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

In the world of *The Purge*, humans watch "grotesquerie on TV for entertainment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, similar to how they might watch other televised events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Families may even plan to "lock down, watch some Purge events" as if it's "nothing special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Media as a Self-Criticism

*The Purge* itself, a violent film, acts as a [[social_critique_using_popular_media | criticism of its own nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. It provides an opportunity for the viewer to "release some aggression by watching a good old-fashioned bloodbath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, implicating [[analysis_of_audiences_complicity_and_enjoyment_in_excess | audience complicity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The analysis of the film further perpetuates this cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

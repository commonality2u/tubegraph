[[South Parks approach to social satire | *South Park*]] has adapted its format in recent seasons, moving from standalone episodes to season-long serialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Season 19 notably integrated themes like [[Political correctness and its critique in South Park | PC culture]], [[Artificial intelligence and advertising in South Park | advertising]], and gentrification into a multi-episode arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Season 20 continued this ambitious approach, weaving together storylines involving the [[Impact of 2016 presidential election on South Park | presidential election]], "member berries," and a significant amount of internet trolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The "And Then" vs. "But/Therefore" Rule

A key to *South Park*'s effective writing is a strict plotline rule: if "and then" fits between plot beats, the narrative lacks cause and effect, leading to a weak story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Good *South Park*-approved writing requires replacing "ands" with "buts" or "therefores," ensuring each action indicates a consequence or reaction to the previous one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This rule maintains the show's momentum and ensures every plot point matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Trolling Plotline: Initial Structure

The trolling subplot, featuring Kyle's dad Gerald as the notorious troll "skankhunt42," initially adhered to this golden rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

*   Gerald's trolling angers the Danes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, the Danes threaten to release everyone's internet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   This threat sends Gerald, Cartman, the town of South Park, and the world into a panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   Hillary Clinton, confident in her presidential bid, fears that "Troll Trace" might expose her online activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Therefore**, she needs "skankhunt42" to help her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

This setup suggested a coherent narrative where a newly elected Hillary would recruit Gerald to prevent the release of compromising emails by Troll Trace, with Gerald agreeing to delete evidence to save himself from exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Narrative Breakdown Post-Election

The unexpected outcome of the 2016 election, with Mr. Garrison (representing Trump) winning instead of Hillary Clinton, forced the writers to make last-minute rewrites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This immediately caused the narrative structure to crumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Without Hillary's presidency to defend, her reason for recruiting Gerald became unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. She confusingly recruits him anyway for a vague mission to infiltrate Denmark and steal their technology to protect U.S. secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This scene felt "super weird and disjointed," likely recycled from the pre-election version of the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

In a desperate attempt to salvage the plot, the show resorted to a series of "and thens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>:
*   Clinton's claim was a ruse to help the Danes kidnap American trolls for protection of her emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   The Danes were just trolling the American trolls they captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   The top Danish guy wasn't trying to punish trolls; he was also just a giant troll "trolling the world for the lulz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   And he wasn't even Danish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

This progression led to a "random progression of events that build without any apparent logic," departing from *South Park*'s usual method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The show's writers openly complained about the narrative hole they dug for themselves, constantly dealing with "trolling and internet stuff over and over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## "Blowing Up the Internet"

To resolve the increasingly complex and incoherent storylines, particularly the risks faced by Cartman and Gerald from their internet history being revealed, the show opted to "blow everything up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Characters from Ike to Pentagon generals collaborated in a massive trolling blitz, aided by Elon Musk's SpaceX program, to take down the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

This act of destroying the internet and deleting everyone's secrets also destroyed the cause-and-effect relationships built throughout the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Instead of a satisfying conclusion, audiences received a "big ol' Psych! We're blowing everything up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Before this abrupt ending, the season had effectively analyzed how the internet fragmented public and private selves and how online anonymity enabled people to behave badly without repercussions from loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This promising build-up ultimately went unresolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### Trevor's Axiom

The show also skillfully satirized the outrage cycles dominant in internet culture, where trolls expertly manipulate emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. "Trevor's axiom," an equation for one person to create a massive online reaction, was briefly mentioned as bringing out "the worst in humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This idea, which Mr. Garrison himself linked to his election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, could have been a more compelling explanation for his victory than the "member berries" plot, but it was not fully developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Future of Serialization

The creators hinted at the end of serialization with the final episode of season 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. While season 20 was "messy," seasons 18 and 19 demonstrated the potential of serialization, suggesting that the unexpected election outcome significantly impacted the narrative coherence of the trolling and internet culture themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

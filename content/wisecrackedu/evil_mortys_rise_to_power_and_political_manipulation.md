[[Rick and Morty episode analysis | Season 3 episode 7]] of *Rick and Morty*, "The Ricklantis Mixup," is described as one of the darkest and densest of the season, building a complex and dismal political world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Within this setting, the episode paints a picture of modern politics, focusing on themes of hope, resistance, and revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Evil Morty's Ascent

Evil Morty's rise to power is a central subplot, where he initially gains support on a platform of unity and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45">[02:45]</a>. He appeals to a "class consciousness" among the Ricks and Mortys of the Citadel, advocating for them to unite against the ruling elite for a better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21">[09:21]</a>.

### Political Manipulation and Totalitarian Intentions

However, Evil Morty quickly reveals his grander, more totalitarian intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49">[02:49]</a>. He dismisses apparent societal divisions, such as homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks, as mere "distractions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>. Instead, he posits that the true problem lies with "Ricks and Mortys feeding on the citadel's death," emphasizing a divide between the rich and the working class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30">[04:30]</a>.

The "change" he promises is ultimately depicted as "just a ploy" to secure power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59">[08:59]</a>. The episode's subplots, such as the orphaned Mortys' journey for a better world, serve to illustrate the naive belief that individual sacrifices or wishes can genuinely alter systemic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a>. Their wish portal, for instance, turns out to be a garbage portal, symbolizing how the system converts hopes into "literal trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41">[08:41]</a>.

### Consolidation of Power

After ascending, Evil Morty performs a "brutal purge" of his political opponents, demonstrating that his initial platform was "nothing more than lip service as a means to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29">[09:29]</a>. This reinforces the episode's dark message that in a complex political reality, the most one can hope for is the illusion of making a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21">[08:21]</a>. The show suggests that despite their actions, nothing the characters did ultimately mattered, though they are left to believe it did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14">[09:14]</a>.

The episode also hints at a deeper philosophical underpinning to Evil Morty's view of societal function, possibly linked to a Latin phrase seen on a chalkboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45">[09:45]</a>. Further discussions on the show's commentary on media, state violence, and governmental control are explored in related content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51">[09:51]</a>.

*The Last Jedi*, directed by [[Rian Johnsons approach to Star Wars canon | Rian Johnson]], garnered significant fan backlash, with common criticisms including Luke Skywalker's portrayal, Snoke's demise, Holdo's plan, the Canto Bight sequence, Rey's parents being "nobody," and pervasive Marvel-style humor like the "General Hugs" joke [[00:00:15]]. Despite the fan rage, the film intended to [[Rian Johnsons approach to Star Wars canon | revolutionize Star Wars]] but ultimately did not [[00:00:45]].

## Subverting Expectations and Traditions

[[Rian Johnsons approach to Star Wars canon | Rian Johnson]] aimed to progress the *Star Wars* franchise and its galaxy by abrasively undermining the tropes and traditions of previous films [[00:02:45]].

### Meta-Commentary on New vs. Old Star Wars

The relationship between Kylo Ren and Darth Vader can be interpreted as a meta-commentary on the relationship between the new *Star Wars* series and the original trilogy [[00:01:14]]. *The Force Awakens* depicted Kylo Ren as burdened by living up to his grandfather's legend, mirroring the new series' pressure to live up to the original trilogy's legacy [[00:01:26]]. Just as Kylo Ren mimics Darth Vader by dressing like him and using a voice modulator, *The Force Awakens* mimicked *A New Hope* "beat per beat" [[00:01:37]].

In *The Last Jedi*'s opening, Snoke tells Kylo to remove his mask, stating, "you're no Vader. You're just a child" [[00:01:54]]. Kylo then breaks his mask, and Luke Skywalker's lightsaber is also thrown off a cliff [[00:02:15]]. This telegraphs Johnson's intent to avoid rehashing the original trilogy, signaling a radical subversion of the *Star Wars* formula where "for the new Star Wars to live, the old Star Wars must die" [[00:02:21]].

### Undermining Heroic Archetypes

[[Rian Johnsons approach to Star Wars canon | Johnson]] challenged established character archetypes:
*   **Rey's Parents**: Unlike Luke Skywalker, who had "noble blood," Rey's parents were "degenerate winos" and "filthy junk traders" who "sold [her] off for drinking money" [[00:02:58]].
*   **Heroes**: Heroes are depicted as janitors and mechanics rather than politicians and princesses [[00:03:10]].
*   **Luke Skywalker**: Luke transforms from an idealistic hero into a "failed nephew murder/slovenian philosopher" [[00:03:15]].
*   **Yoda and the Jedi Order**: Yoda shifts from a symbol of Jedi piety to a "would-be book burner" [[00:03:19]]. The film portrays the Jedi Order as flawed, with their legacy being "failure. Hypocrisy. Hubris," and notes they allowed Darth Sidious to rise and were responsible for [[anakin_skywalkers_transformation_into_darth_vader | Darth Vader]]'s creation [[00:03:26]].

Johnson suggests that past films' events didn't lead to progress, as a "nearly identical Nazi-inspired fascistic order has risen" after the Empire's collapse [[00:03:55]].

## Complicating Good and Evil

[[Rian Johnsons approach to Star Wars canon | Johnson]] suggests that the re-emergence of evil stems from an "inadequate conception of good and evil" [[00:04:09]]. *Star Wars* mythology is built around "stark divisions between good and evil" [[00:04:18]].

### The Monomyth, Jungian Archetypes, and The Shadow

George Lucas crafted the original trilogy around Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," which details the "monomyth" or universal story structure [[00:04:30]]. [[Rian Johnsons approach to Star Wars canon | Johnson]] uses this framework to complicate the relationship to the dark side, building on Carl Jung's psychological concepts of the "collective unconscious" and "archetypes" [[00:04:51]].

One such archetype is the "shadow," described by Jung as the primal, repressed part of the unconscious, or the "dark side" [[00:05:14]]. In the monomyth, the shadow often manifests as a character representing the protagonist's shortcomings and fears, such as Gollum for Frodo or Darth Vader for Luke Skywalker [[00:05:29]]. Darth Vader, a powerful Jedi who succumbed to the Dark Side, serves as a "constant reminder of what [Luke] could become" if he didn't conquer his fear and master his passions [[00:05:46]]. Luke's sparing of Darth Vader's life is presented as a victory over his inner demons, as striking him down in anger would mean losing the battle [[00:06:02]].

However, *The Last Jedi* deviates from this by suggesting that balance in the Force is inherently promoted by the Force itself: "When the darkness rises, the force amplifies the light to balance it out" [[00:06:28]]. Snoke implies that a powerful Jedi order would be met by an equally powerful dark side [[00:06:52]]. This leads Luke to criticize the Jedi Order, partly blaming them for the "cyclical rise and fall of these fascist empires" [[00:07:02]]. Luke states, "The force does not belong to the Jedi... if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity" [[00:07:16]].

According to Jungian analyst Robert A. Johnson (not [[Rian Johnsons approach to Star Wars canon | Rian Johnson]]), the "dark sides" should not be merely conquered and expunged, as repression causes "ego split" and "accumulate[s] the darkness" [[00:07:41]]. This suppression leads to finding scapegoats and projecting one's "ugliness onto them, leading to a never-ending fight" [[00:07:57]]. This is explicitly done in the original *Star Wars*, where Luke's inner demons are "projected onto an evil space wizard" [[00:08:06]].

[[Rian Johnsons approach to Star Wars canon | Johnson]] attempts to complicate the traditional good/bad distinction within characters and the plot [[00:08:15]]. The film suggests that conquering evil with good has been ineffective, as the Empire has returned with a "sexy new rebranding" and Snoke is "Palpatine 2.0" [[00:08:25]]. *The Last Jedi* tries to "tweak[] the basic Jung-ish formula" by suggesting the galaxy needs to reconcile its dark side with the larger order of things, aiming for "Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness" [[00:08:43]].

### Moral Ambiguity and Systemic Critique

Benicio del Toro's character, DJ, exemplifies this moral ambiguity. He challenges the traditional distinction between "purely good Rebels and purely evil oppressors" by revealing that "even the good guys can get caught up with the darker elements of the universe" [[00:09:02]]. DJ, a cynical mercenary, views "good guys" and "bad guys" as "made up words," noting that arms dealers sell weapons to both sides [[00:09:21]]. This is portrayed as the "most morally ambiguous moment in any Star Wars film," complicating the understanding of the rebellion as infallibly good [[00:09:49]].

Robert Johnson argues that the inability to reconcile with one's shadow and subsequent scapegoating leads to "violence, war, and racism" [[00:10:02]]. For *The Last Jedi*, it's not merely good versus bad, but a system at play, explicitly critiquing the galaxy's "military economy" and "exploitation and animal rights violations inherent in it," even implicating heroes like Princess Leia [[00:10:17]].

## The Failure to Revolutionize

Despite going "out of its way" to advocate for "kill[ing] the past" – both the *Star Wars* film structure and its moral lens – *The Last Jedi* ultimately backpedals [[00:10:47]].

Kylo Ren offers Rey a chance to "end all the dogmatism of the previous films" by joining him: "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to... Snoke. Skywalker. The Sith. The Jedi. The rebels. Let it all die. Rey. I want you to join me" [[00:10:59]]. However, Rey refuses, leading to the film "backpedal central" [[00:11:21]].

The film ultimately reaffirms the very things it seemed to tear down:
*   **Heroic Archetypes**: Despite tearing down the heroic archetypes, "The legend of Luke Skywalker lives on" [[00:11:38]].
*   **Established Orders**: The Jedi Order, despite Luke's earlier declaration that "It's time for the Jedi to die," is reaffirmed by Rey's statement, "And I will not be the last Jedi" [[00:12:24]].
*   **Narrative Structure**: The film reverts to the established narrative structure of the original trilogy, even echoing dialogue like "Strike me down in anger, and I’ll always be with you" and "If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine" [[00:12:35]].
*   **Jedi Past**: Despite the idea of forgetting the Jedi past, the books are saved [[00:12:47]].

The ideological shifts in the film are presented as perplexing reversals rather than plot-driven reconsiderations [[00:12:50]]. Luke reaffirms "antiquated ideas" seemingly because he "loves his sister" [[00:13:02]]. The film shifts from "don't be a hero" to it being "ok to be a hero" [[00:13:09]].

While *The Last Jedi* makes a "psychologically sophisticated case" for Rey to team up with Kylo Ren, given that "the old way doesn’t work" and Jedis are "repressed," Rey hesitates despite her faith in Ren's goodness and Luke's lesson about the Force being "beyond good and evil" [[00:13:21]].

Kylo Ren is presented as the "realist" offering a "Jungian balance" by recognizing that "ego and shadow are both part of a person, and what’s more, that one literally cannot exist without the other" [[00:13:47]]. In contrast, Rey represents "the old moral code of Star Wars," choosing to be the "good Jedi," an "infallible hero who definitely isn’t suppressing a lifetime’s supply of darkness" [[00:14:25]].

Ultimately, the film is criticized for "abrasively subverting everything we love and know about Star Wars" only to "shrug and revert back to where we started" [[00:14:50]].

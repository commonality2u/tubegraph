*The Last Jedi* (2017) attempted to revolutionize the *Star Wars* franchise by challenging its foundational tropes and narrative structures. Despite intending to progress the series, the film ultimately struggled to fully commit to its own subversive themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, leading to a polarizing [[Fan reaction to The Last Jedi | fan reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## A Meta-Commentary on Legacy

The film offers a meta-commentary on the relationship between the new *Star Wars* trilogy and its original predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Kylo Ren's struggle to live up to the legend of Darth Vader parallels the new series' pressure to match the original trilogy's legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. *The Force Awakens* mimicked *A New Hope* almost "beat per beat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. In *The Last Jedi*, Snoke's command for Kylo to remove his mask, followed by Ren breaking it, explicitly signals director [[Rian Johnsons approach to revolutionizing Star Wars | Rian Johnson's approach to revolutionizing Star Wars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This act, alongside Luke Skywalker discarding his lightsaber, telegraphs to the audience that the film aims to be a "radical subversion of the Star Wars formula" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. For new *Star Wars* to live, the old *Star Wars* must die, as encapsulated by Kylo Ren's mantra: "Let the past die. Kill it if you have to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Subverting Established Tropes

Johnson's approach involves abrasively undermining the tropes and traditions that defined previous films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:
*   **Heroic Lineage:** Unlike Luke Skywalker, who was of "noble blood," Rey's parents are revealed to be "filthy junk traders" who sold her for drinking money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The heroes are no longer politicians and princesses but "janitors and mechanics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Luke Skywalker's Character:** Luke transforms from an idealistic hero into a "failed nephew murder/slovenian philosopher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **The Jedi Order:** Yoda, once a symbol of Jedi piety, becomes a "would-be book burner," and the Jedi order itself is critiqued as a failure marked by "hypocrisy" and "hubris," responsible for the rise of Darth Sidious and Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

These subversions suggest that the events of previous films did not lead to true progress, as a "nearly identical Nazi-inspired fascistic order has risen" after the Empire's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Challenging [[Good versus evil in Star Wars mythology | Good versus Evil in Star Wars Mythology]]

Johnson implies that the re-emergence of evil stems from an "inadequate conception of good and evil" within the galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. While the original *Star Wars* mythology was built on stark divisions between light and dark, *The Last Jedi* attempts to complicate this binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### [[Jungian psychology and The Last Jedi | Jungian Psychology and the Shadow Archetype]]

The original trilogy's narrative structure, influenced by Joseph Campbell's "the monomyth" from *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*, is rooted in Carl Jung's concepts of the collective unconscious and archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Johnson uses this framework not to recycle it, but to complicate the relationship to the dark side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Jung's "shadow" archetype represents the primal, repressed "dark side" of our unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. In the monomyth, this dark side is often embodied by an antagonist who reflects the protagonist's fears, such as Darth Vader to Luke Skywalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The original *Star Wars* encouraged conquering inner demons by defeating the physical embodiment of the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

*The Last Jedi*, however, suggests a different approach. The film posits that the Force inherently promotes balance: when darkness rises, the Force amplifies the light to counteract it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This implies that a powerful Jedi Order might inadvertently lead to an equally powerful dark side, suggesting the Jedi themselves might be partly responsible for the cyclical rise of fascist empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The film argues that if "the Jedi die, the light dies" is "vanity," and that the Force does not belong exclusively to the Jedi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Jungian analyst Robert A. Johnson (not to be confused with Rian Johnson) proposes that our "dark sides" should not be merely conquered and expunged, as repression leads to "ego split" and the projection of one's "ugliness onto others," causing "a never-ending fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This is exemplified by the original *Star Wars* projecting Luke's inner demons onto Darth Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. *The Last Jedi* attempts to complicate the "classic distinction between good and bad" in characters and plot, suggesting that "conquering evil with good hasn't done much for the galaxy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Moral Ambiguity and Systemic Critique

The character of DJ (Benicio del Toro) serves as a key symbol of moral ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. He exposes how both the "good guys" (Rebels) and "bad guys" (First Order) are complicit in the galaxy's military economy, selling weapons to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. DJ's cynical view that "good guys? Bad guys? Made up words" marks the film's most morally ambiguous moment, challenging the audience's understanding of the Rebellion as infallibly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The film criticizes the galaxy's "military economy" and its inherent exploitation, even by heroes like Princess Leia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Thematic Backpedaling

Despite its stated intention to "kill the past" and radically redefine the *Star Wars* narrative and moral lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, *The Last Jedi* ultimately reverts to old tropes.

*   **Rey's Choice:** Kylo Ren offers Rey a chance to end the "dogmatism of the previous films" by joining him and letting "Snoke. Skywalker. The Sith. The Jedi. The rebels. Let it all die," but Rey refuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Reaffirmation of Heroism:** The film undermines the heroic archetypes inherent in the monomyth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, yet Luke Skywalker's "legend" is reaffirmed and inspires the galaxy once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Jedi's Survival:** The assertion that "It's time for the Jedi to die" is contradicted by Rey's declaration, "And I will not be the last Jedi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The film returns to established narrative structures from the original trilogy, such as the idea of becoming "more powerful than you can possibly imagine" after being struck down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The Jedi books are also saved, further contradicting the call to "forget the Jedi past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

The film's psychological case for Rey joining Ren—that "the old way doesn't work," Jedis are "repressed as hell," and the galaxy is stuck in a "galactic game of Nazi Whack-a-Mole"—is contradicted by Rey's decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Ren, understanding both his "bad side and his good," appears closer to achieving [[Jungian psychology and The Last Jedi | Jungian balance]] by recognizing that ego and shadow are interdependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Rey, however, represents the "old moral code of Star Wars," choosing to be the "good Jedi," a "morally-pure, infallible hero who definitely isn't suppressing a lifetime's supply of darkness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Ultimately, *The Last Jedi* is criticized for its failure to commit to its radical subversions, instead reverting to the very ideas it sought to deconstruct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

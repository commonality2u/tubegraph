*BoJack Horseman* is a Netflix animated series that, despite its colorful animation and talking animals, delves into a "dark and downright depressing reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The show focuses on the disillusionment that arises from looking beneath the surface, revealing an "ugly, narcissistic reality that lies behind the dazzling fa√ßade of Hollywoo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This veneer, much like the "trappings of our daily lives," serves to cover up the "meaninglessness of existence itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, an idea foundational to the show's exploration of [[existential_nihilism_and_bojack_horseman | Existential Nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. A key way the characters in *BoJack Horseman* cope with the anguish of a meaningless world is by distracting themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Characters and their Distractions

Several characters in *BoJack Horseman* exemplify the use of distraction as a coping mechanism:

*   **Princess Carolyn** constantly distracts herself with her demanding job and her "compulsive need to fix the life of those she cares about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Despite her complaints about work dominating her life, she struggles with free time, eventually finding her way "right back to the Hollywoo grindstone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Todd** is happy as long as he has "something to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. When left without a task, he spirals into "existential despair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, questioning his purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> before quickly finding "something to take his mind off it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. His pursuits include composing a space opera, building his own Disneyland, and starting various businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Mr. Peanutbutter** lives in a constant state of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. He acknowledges that "the universe is a cruel uncaring void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, believing that "the key to being happy isn't the search for meaning. It's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense. And eventually...you'll be dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **BoJack** himself defines his entire life as a "series of distractions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The show humorously depicts his trivial days, often skipping over what he's doing half the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. After *Horsin' Around* ended, BoJack drifted through life in a "near constant state of distraction" for eleven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Philosophical Basis: Blaise Pascal

The show explores the question of why successful celebrities like BoJack, who "have everything," are not happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This concept was addressed by 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal, considered a precursor to the Existentialists <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

For Pascal, humans, when given "too much time to think," inevitably contemplate their own insignificance, leading to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. He states:
> "I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact: that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber. I have found that there is one very real reason, namely, the natural poverty of our feeble and mortal condition so miserable that nothing can comfort us when we think of it closely." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>

Pascal argued that humans possess a "natural psychological defense mechanism": easy distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. When distracted, people stop thinking about their existence and can be "at least functional" if not happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He applied this to figures of power, like kings, who, without diversion, would find their "feeble happiness will not sustain him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Similarly, BoJack, having no "serious struggle to occupy his life," spends his time trying to distract himself to avoid confronting his reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## The Crushing of Distraction

BoJack's "whole charade comes crashing down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> when he reads Diane's book, "One Trick Pony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The book provides an honest reflection of him, forcing him to face his true self and the extent of his "self-deception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He is confronted with the idea that his fame allowed him to be "constantly surrounded by distraction" and avoid being "alone with himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Once distraction fails, Pascal suggests turning to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. However, *BoJack Horseman* presents Hollywoo as a "post-God-Is-Dead world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, with Santa Claus used as a stand-in to discuss the "non-existence of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> and the notion that "good behavior will lead to happiness" is simply "not true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Failed Attempts to Force Distraction

When BoJack's primary coping mechanism collapses, his first choice is to return "right back to distraction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The show illustrates that forcing distraction after the illusion has been broken leads to tragic outcomes:

*   **Secretariat's Advice**: A young BoJack receives advice from Secretariat that essentially amounts to "Don't Think About It" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>: "When you get sad...you run...straight ahead...and...and you keep running forward no matter what...Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you. There's nothing for you behind you. All that exists is what's ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. However, once Secretariat is "disqualified from racing" and can no longer keep his thoughts at bay, the advice proves insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Sarah Lynn's Bender**: BoJack's decision to drag Sarah Lynn on a "months long bender" is an attempt to reclaim a distracted state, which tragically ends with her overdose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Driving, similar to Secretariat's advice, serves as a way for BoJack to try to escape the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. However, in a moment of despair, he releases the steering wheel, submitting himself to what appears to be suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Ultimately, the show suggests that while distraction can temporarily mask the meaninglessness of existence, it is not a sustainable solution once one becomes aware of the underlying void.

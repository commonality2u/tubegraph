*Death Note* is an anime phenomenon that addresses a wide range of philosophical topics, with one of the most prominent being Justice—what it is and how it should be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Unlike most pop culture, *Death Note* is unique not in *what* it says about justice, but *how* it goes about saying it, constantly challenging various definitions of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Premise
*Death Note* follows [[character_analysis_light_yagami_and_his_moral_transformation | Light Yagami]], a model student, who discovers a supernatural notebook called the Death Note, which allows him to kill anyone by writing their name and picturing their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. Light aims to use the Death Note to create a world devoid of crime and adopts the public persona of “Kira,” the God of his new world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10">[01:10]</a>. His anonymous killings lead him into conflict with law enforcement, a mysterious detective named L, and L's successors, M and N <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21">[01:21]</a>.

Throughout the show, multiple characters explore what does and does not constitute justice, frequently declaring "I am justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31">[01:31]</a>.

## Light Yagami's Vision of Justice
Light's initial moral compass suggests a desire for moral obligation, believing the world is "rotting" and those causing it "deserve to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[02:05]</a>. As Kira, Light operates on an "ends-justify-the-means" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18">[02:18]</a>. He believes that the end goal of being a "crime-zapping uber-tyrant" justifies any action, including shamelessly using his girlfriend, Misa, to distract the police and maximize his kill count, and even killing non-criminals who obstruct him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21">[02:21]</a>.

When Light temporarily renounces ownership of the Death Note and loses his memories of being Kira, his personality and sense of justice noticeably change. He refuses to exploit Misa's feelings, a stark contrast to his Kira persona, which feigned love for years for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47">[02:47]</a>. However, upon regaining his memories and powers, his Kira persona returns, and "treating people well" is discarded for "Justice with a capital J" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>. This tension between Light pre- and post-Notebook is a recurring motif <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>.

Light grapples with moral and practical dilemmas through internal conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>. His conception of justice is that the world *needs* a Kira, and as the chosen one, he is willing to sacrifice himself to make it happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04">[10:04]</a>. He views himself as a martyr, willing to contend with a "rotten self" to clean a "rotten world," aiming to create a perfect world free of injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14">[09:14]</a>. This perspective aligns with an Old Testament-style "bloodbath" where sinners are punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13">[10:13]</a>.

## [[the_influence_of_the_ring_of_gyges_and_philosophical_texts_on_death_note | The Ring of Gyges]] and Anonymity
[[exploration_of_moral_themes_in_the_show | Death Note's exploration of moral themes]] draws parallels to the ancient Greek story of [[the_influence_of_the_ring_of_gyges_and_philosophical_texts_on_death_note | The Ring of Gyges]] from Plato's *Republic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>. In this story, a man finds a ring that grants invisibility, which he uses to commit crimes and take power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21">[04:21]</a>.

Plato's character Glaucon uses this fable to argue that justice is merely a social contract to prevent people from harming each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43">[04:43]</a>. He suggests that people only value justice for its ability to make them look good, and someone with an invisibility ring would naturally act like an "asshat" because their actions cannot be scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53">[04:53]</a>. This connects directly to [[role_of_anonymity_and_identity_in_understanding_justice_in_death_note | Light's pseudonymity as Kira]] and the anonymous support he garners online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10">[05:10]</a>. As soon as the risk of damaging one's reputation is gone, so is the interest in justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28">[05:28]</a>. Light, the "golden boy valedictorian," maintains a facade of "normal" morality while taking joy in acts far worse than breaking social codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55">[05:55]</a>.

A key question *Death Note* asks is: "What does Justice mean when nobody's looking?" This theme is reinforced by [[role_of_anonymity_and_identity_in_understanding_justice_in_death_note | Light's pseudonymity, L and N's namelessness, and the anonymity of Kira's supporters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a>.

## *Death Note* as a Modern Socratic Dialogue
*The Republic* is a Socratic Dialogue, less concerned with offering a fixed theory of justice than with detailing the process of exploring it through hypothetical scenarios and varying definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39">[06:39]</a>. *Death Note* functions similarly, showing the movement and evolution of theories of justice between and within its characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55">[06:55]</a>. Characters like Misa, Light, and Mikami believe they possess true knowledge of justice, and the tension between these characters and their skeptics forms the core of the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03">[07:03]</a>.

From Light's initial vision of a new world, the question of justice is immediately raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52">[07:52]</a>. Ryuk, motivated by boredom, becomes Light's first challenger, pointing out the contradiction in Light's argument that if he kills all criminals, he would be the only "bad person left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10">[08:10]</a>. This exchange initiates the Socratic Dialogue that continues throughout the series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38">[08:38]</a>.

## [[comparative_analysis_of_justice_theories_rawls_plato_and_death_note | Competing Theories of Justice]]
The show presents two contrasting approaches to justice:

*   **Ideal Theory (Light/Kira, aligned with John Rawls and Plato):**
    Philosopher John Rawls, much like Light and Plato, argues that to correct injustices, one must first have an idea of what "justice" is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44">[11:44]</a>. This "ideal theory" posits that when considering justice, one should first understand what it would look like in a perfect world where everyone does the right thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54">[11:54]</a>. For Light and Mikami, this "ideal" involves many people being dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07">[12:07]</a>. Light's vision is of a world created around a perfect "Justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02">[13:02]</a>.

*   **Injustice Theory (L/M/N, aligned with Naomi Zack):**
    Philosopher Naomi Zack favors "injustice theory," which does not rely on a preexisting ideal of "justice" or a perfect just society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14">[12:14]</a>. Instead, it focuses on identifying injustices where they occur, arguing it's more practical to point to a specific injustice than to start from a broad definition of what is just <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24">[12:24]</a>. Justice, by this measure, is applied only after injustice has been identified to correct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36">[12:36]</a>. The L-M-N alphabet soup's hunt for Kira is driven by the recognition that Kira's "new world" is unjust, rather than a high-minded definition of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42">[12:42]</a>. L appears to see justice as a response to injustice, making any definition of "The Just" secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54">[12:54]</a>.

## Matsuda's Role as Inquisitor
Matsuda serves as a surprising "inquisitor," similar to Socrates in *The Republic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08">[14:08]</a>. He sincerely questions the moral judgments of nearly everyone, including Light, Kira, the Japanese Police, and L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11">[14:11]</a>. Despite being mocked for his inability to conform, Matsuda points out that violent crime decreased after Kira began killing, and later questions whether Kira is "completely evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21">[14:21]</a>.

Unlike Light, who is convinced of his project, or L and N, who are obsessed with catching him, Matsuda constantly questions the values presented to him as fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24">[15:24]</a>. He recognizes his own ignorance, which is crucial for revealing the ignorance of those around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06">[16:06]</a>. Even in the end, as he kills Light, he does so with questions rather than answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15">[16:15]</a>. By forcing viewers and characters to consider their own opinions of justice, Matsuda helps to organize the competing ideas into an intelligible conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25">[16:25]</a>.

## Conclusion
*Death Note* offers no clear consensus on who best represented justice or whether Light's "New World" justified the means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38">[16:38]</a>. This ambiguity is what makes the show poignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47">[16:47]</a>. While an addicting detective procedural, it never abandons its original question of what makes a just world, and most importantly, it never provides a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50">[16:50]</a>.

As Light himself states, "If Kira gets caught then that makes him evil. But if he wins and rules the world then I guess he's justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01">[17:01]</a>. Kira's defeat by N suggests N's brand of justice prevails in the show's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10">[17:10]</a>. However, this "winner-gets-all morality" reveals the war of competing moral codes as a "logic game" rather than a "truth-seeking" endeavor, leaving the viewer to question the true meaning of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21">[17:21]</a>.

The true connection between the Justice of *The Republic* and justice in *Death Note* lies not in their definitions, but in their shared method of philosophical inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06">[18:06]</a>. This method distinguishes *Death Note* as a show that *does* philosophy rather than merely borrowing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13">[18:13]</a>.

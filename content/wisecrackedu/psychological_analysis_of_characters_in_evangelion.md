*Neon Genesis Evangelion* (Eva) is an incredibly complex narrative that, beneath its surface story of apocalyptic events and giant biomechanical monsters, offers a deep investigation into psychosexual development, intimacy, unconscious human motivation, and the inherent difficulties of human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The series extensively explores themes of isolation, suffering, and the human condition, often drawing upon philosophical and psychoanalytic concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## The Human Condition and the Hedgehog's Dilemma

A guiding theme of *Evangelion* is the "Hedgehog's Dilemma," a parable detailed by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in his work *Parega and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays. Volume 2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Schopenhauer compares humans to hedgehogs seeking warmth but unable to get too close due to their quills, illustrating that intimacy often leads to pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This dilemma is explicitly referenced in Episode Three by Ritsuko: "Even though a hedgehog may wanna become close with another hedgehog, the closer they get the more they injure each other with their spines. It's the same with some humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, and Episode Four is titled "The Hedgehog's Dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This desire to avoid hurt creates a world of despair, where characters experience deep sadness, isolation, and intimacy problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Episode Sixteen, titled "Sickness Unto Death," references Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard's concept of despair, a terrible existential loneliness that aligns with Schopenhauer's ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Schopenhauer argues in "The World as Will and Representation" that life is suffering because the world is composed of will and representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. He posits that the nature of reality is unity, and suffering arises from individuality and the struggle to communicate perfectly between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This concept of separated wills is depicted in the show as **AT-fields** (Absolute Terror Fields), which are described as the unique human soul that separates each person's ego and acts as a barrier preventing true connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

Characters frequently reflect on what it means to be an ego and possess a body, especially as their consciousness fades, highlighting the universal nature of fear regarding perceived "lack" and the inherent difficulty of individual existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>:
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> "At the core we are all the same.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> ”Our minds lack something basic.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> “And we fear that lack.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> “We fear it.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> “And that is why we are attempting to become one.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> “We will melt with and fill each other.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> “This is the instrumentality.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> “Mankind cannot live without being surrounded by others.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a> “Mankind cannot live alone.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a> “Although you yourself are always unique.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> “That is why life is hard.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> “That is why life is sad and empty.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> “Thus, you want the close physical and mental presence of others.”
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> “That is why we wish to become one.”

## [[freudian_psychoanalysis_and_neon_genesis_evangelion | Freudian Psychoanalysis]]

*Evangelion* explicitly uses [[freudian_psychoanalysis_and_neon_genesis_evangelion | Freudian terms and ideas]] in its [[philosophical_themes_in_neon_genesis_evangelion | philosophical exploration]] of characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

*   **Introjection:** Episode Nineteen is titled "Introjection," a Freudian term describing how individuals unconsciously adopt the characteristics of those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Oral Stage:** Episode Twenty, "Weaving a Story 2: Oral Stage," directly references Freud's psychosexual stage associated with breastfeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The show suggests that weaning a child too soon can lead to sociopathic tendencies, while weaning too late can result in neurotic dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Mourning vs. Melancholia:** The pilot children are largely motherless, or believe themselves to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Their reactions to their mothers' presence (or lack thereof) in their Evas reflect Freudian concepts of mourning (knowing what is lost) and melancholia (not knowing what is missing but feeling deep sadness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Rei, as an artificial being without a "mama soul," exhibits melancholia, a deeper sadness due to an unknown loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **The Magi System:** The NERV supercomputer network, Magi, is composed of three parts (Casper, Balthasar, and Melchior), each imprinted with the mind of Dr. Naoko Akagi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. These parts reflect Freud's tri-part model of the human unconscious: the controlling scientist as the ego, the mother as the punishing superego, and the woman as the sexual id <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Ambivalence:** Episode Eighteen is titled "Ambivalence," a Freudian concept describing the simultaneous presence of passionate love and hate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **Eros and Thanatos (Life and Death Drives):** Freud's pleasure principle, the drive to avoid pain and maximize pleasure, is evident in characters like Shinji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The struggle to avoid pain in a world shared with others, each with conflicting desires, leads to the desire for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This desire for tranquility, a return to a state of peace, is aligned with Freud's Death Drive (Thanatos), a longing to return to the harmony of the womb or, ultimately, the end of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. The Instrumentality Project, which seeks to combine all human consciousness into a primordial soup (LCL), represents this desire for a unified whole, free from the self and suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Character-Specific Analyses

*   **Shinji Ikari:**
    *   Struggles with isolation and the pain of rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
    *   Exhibits ambivalence towards his father, Gendo, stating he hates him but repeatedly pilots his Eva to gain his father's praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
    *   His mother, Yui, is the soul within Eva Unit 01, influencing his disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
    *   Experiences a profound desire to minimize suffering, as shown when he laments the pain and suffering in the world while in a Dirac sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
    *   The final episodes and film depict a "psychotherapy session" inside Shinji's mind, where he confronts his identity and dependence on Eva piloting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
    *   Initially considers instrumentality as a return to a peaceful, primal state without loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, but ultimately rejects it, choosing individuality and accepting the potential for pain in exchange for the presence of others and self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

*   **Asuka Langley Soryu:**
    *   Pilots her Eva to find meaning and avoid loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
    *   Though seemingly tough, flashbacks reveal her deep fear of being alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   Part of her mother's soul resides in Unit 02, influencing her connection to the Eva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

*   **Rei Ayanami:**
    *   A clone and artificial being, she is depicted as melancholic rather than mournful, as she has no true "loss" to grieve, lacking a "mama soul" to be in her Eva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
    *   Her name "Rei" can mean "soul, ghost, not, or zero," reflecting her nature as a distinct yet non-individual being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
    *   Reflects on what it means to be human and have a body in episodes 14 and 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   Her bonding with the DNA of Angels Adam and Lilith leads to her becoming a being that contains the consciousness of all humanity, furthering the goal of reunification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   **Gendo Ikari:**
    *   Struggles to show love to Shinji and be a father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
    *   Believes he never deserved love, leading him to reject the world to avoid pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   His pursuit of Instrumentality is driven by a desire for a return to a primal womb state, where souls and minds become one and attain eternal balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

*   **Misato Katsuragi:**
    *   Her loneliness is highlighted when she remarks, "Another phone that will never ring" after Kaji's death, symbolizing a deep longing for connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The character's journey, particularly Shinji's, culminates in a rejection of Instrumentality, the desire to escape pain and individuality by dissolving into a collective consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Instead, Shinji chooses to "continue existing in this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, embracing a world where separation, individual will, desire, and pain exist, but also the potential for hope and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This acceptance of vulnerability is also modeled by Kaworu, who demonstrates unconditional love and the understanding that enduring loneliness and pain is part of the human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

Ultimately, *Evangelion*'s psychological depth addresses the concept of "lack," explored by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This "missing center" at the heart of existence, the gap between internal representation and external reality, manifests in various forms of human relational distress, such as scarcity of friends, failing relationships, and familial distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. The series masterfully weaves a narrative that delves into humanity's "disappointing existence," yet offers a nuanced conclusion that acknowledges suffering as inherent to life, while also opening the door to connection and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

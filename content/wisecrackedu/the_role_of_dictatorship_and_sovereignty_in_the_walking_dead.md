*The Walking Dead*, a show known for its [[social_commentary_in_the_walking_dead | social commentary]], deeply explores themes of power, leadership, and survival in a post-apocalyptic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Beyond its depiction of zombie hordes, the series delves into the complexities of human governance, particularly focusing on the concepts of dictatorship and [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | sovereignty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Dictatorship and Emergency Rule

In the chaotic world of *The Walking Dead*, simple tasks like finding food, maintaining shelter, and avoiding threats become incredibly complicated, especially with multiple people involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Arguments frequently arise over where to go, how to get there, who does what, and how to handle rule-breakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

While Rick's group often attempts to discuss matters, the ever-present threat of violence and incoming walkers makes talking things out impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This leads to a situation where the group's leader, Rick Grimes, assumes increasing authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

At the end of Season 2, Rick explicitly declares a dictatorship, stating, "This isn't a democracy anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This declaration harks back to the ancient Roman legal convention where absolute power was granted to an individual during times of extreme emergency to protect against annihilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Rick Grimes as Cincinnatus

The show draws parallels between Rick and the Roman statesman Cincinnatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Cincinnatus, a farmer, was twice elected dictator of Rome during imminent dangers, only to resign his absolute power and return to his farm once the threat was neutralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Rick's journey—leaving his former life (as a cop) to protect his group against hordes of enemies, with the implied possibility of returning to a more peaceful existence—mirrors this Roman ideal of a reluctant, temporary dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

Other Roman connections in the show include:
*   The Governor's Fight Club, reminiscent of gladiator battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   Terminus, the home of cannibals, named after the Roman god of boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   Romans 6:4, a Bible verse about rising from the dead, scrawled on Father Gabriel's wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

These allusions suggest a deliberate commentary on politics and [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | sovereignty]] within a hyper-violent society constantly facing invaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

## The State of Exception and Sovereignty

The concept of [[role_of_sovereignty_and_state_of_emergency_in_attack_on_titan | sovereignty]] in *The Walking Dead* aligns with German political theorist Carl Schmitt's definition: "The sovereign is whoever makes the exception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This means the sovereign is the individual who can disregard or suspend the law during an emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Rick's declaration of an end to democracy is the most overt example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Other instances of the law being suspended include:
*   Shane killing Randall in the woods, bypassing group will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   Carol killing and burning flu victims in the prison to protect the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben argues that the "state of exception" has become common in modern society, permeating various aspects of life such as the war on terror and refugee camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Agamben's work explored how Nazi concentration camps could occur under a state of exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

### Rick vs. Gareth: The Spectrum of Sovereignty

Rick embodies the modern sovereign who suspends the law for the greater good, to get things done, and to save people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. However, the show implicitly asks if this makes him fundamentally different from figures like Gareth, the leader of Terminus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

The key difference highlighted is that in Terminus, the suspension of law has become permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. While order exists, the residents of Terminus have abandoned basic human morality, such as the prohibition against cannibalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

Agamben's terrifying implication is that individuals like Rick are only "a few setbacks away from becoming Gareth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. This transformation is always justified in the name of survival, reinforcing the "butcher or the cattle" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Rick frequently invokes this "us or them" logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, suggesting a thin line between his actions and Gareth's atrocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

Agamben states:
> "The camp is the space that opens up when the state of exception starts to become the rule." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>

This perspective implies that when the ability of a sovereign to suspend the law becomes the norm rather than the exception, it can lead to horrifying outcomes, where morality is dependent on the individual ruler rather than the rule of law itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. *The Walking Dead* thus offers profound [[moral_dilemmas_and_security_logic_in_apocalyptic_worlds | moral dilemmas and security logic in apocalyptic worlds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, pushing viewers to question the cost of survival and the boundaries of humanity when laws are constantly suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

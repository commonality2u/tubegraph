*Lord of the Flies* by William Golding begins when a G5 plane carrying British boys crash-lands on a remote island in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Among the survivors are Ralph, Piggy, Jack, and Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Initial Attempts at Order

To establish order, Piggy and Ralph discover a large shell, which they name "the conch," and use it to call meetings and discuss matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The children appoint Ralph as their leader, while Jack is made the head hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Initially, Jack is hesitant to kill for food, but he eventually overcomes this and successfully hunts a pig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Fear and Division

During this time, the younger boys become frightened after one claims to have seen a monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Ralph attempts to reassure them, suggesting the monster is not real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

However, Jack later asserts that he saw the beast with his own eyes and challenges Ralph's leadership, claiming Ralph is unfit to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Jack then invites the boys to abandon Ralph's group and join his new crew, promising them "bacon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Lord of the Flies and Escalating Savagery

Jack and his group kill another pig and impale its head on a stick as an offering to the beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Simon experiences a vision where this pig head speaks to him, identifying itself as "The Lord of the Flies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The pig head reveals that the beast is not something to be hunted, but rather the inherent violence within the boys' own hearts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

When Simon returns to the camp, the other boys mistake him for the beast and kill him in a frenzied attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Even Ralph and Piggy participate in the assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Following this event, Jack and his group raid Ralph's camp and steal Piggy's glasses, which are essential for making fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The theft of Piggy's glasses symbolizes a transition from reason to savagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Ralph confronts Jack, leading to a brawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. During the struggle, Piggy is thrown off a cliff, and the conch shatters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This moment, where Piggy and the conch fall, emphasizes the "fall of human kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Outnumbered, Ralph flees towards the shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Rescue and Lost Innocence

Just as Ralph is about to collapse, he spots a Naval officer in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The officer, witnessing the boys attempting to kill Ralph, expresses disbelief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. He then takes the children onto his boat to return them to civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, their innocence is depicted as being irrevocably lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The irony of the rescue is that the soldier himself is in the middle of a war, trying to engage an enemy when he finds the boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This highlights that there is "nobody to save civilized humanity from they violent nature neither" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The pig-head on a stick, "The Lord of the Flies," is a central symbol, another name for Beelzebub, representing the destruction, decay, and demoralization of mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

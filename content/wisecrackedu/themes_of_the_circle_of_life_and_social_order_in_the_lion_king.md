*The Lion King*, an artifact starring EGOT winners Whoopi Goldberg and James Earl Ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, depicts a landmass called Africa where animals speak English and are ruled by the lion Mufasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The film presents a distinctly conservative message, with considerable emphasis placed on the "circle of life" as a natural, fixed social order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Feudal Social Order

The "circle of life" is portrayed as an unchangeable hierarchy within the animal kingdom. If this order is disrupted, it is presented as leading to chaos and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Mufasa, the reigning king, utilizes this concept to legitimize the predatory nature of the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The film's social order is depicted as a feudal system, where an individual's value is determined solely by birth, rather than merit, action, or even bribery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For those not born into the elite, the possibility of upward mobility is nonexistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The overarching message conveyed is "know your place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When Rafiki unveils Simba on Pride Rock, it implies that the new generation is destined to eventually feast on others, in accordance with the universe's laws, and that "resistance is futile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. It is through subjugation that the animals supposedly find peace and confirm their place in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### The Noble Lie

This concept of a fixed social order ties into the Greek philosopher Socrates' "noble lie," as documented by Plato in *The New Republic* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Socrates theorized that if people were told that God instilled different metals (gold, silver, or bronze) into their souls at birth, they would willingly accept their station in life as divinely ordained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Scar's Challenge to the Order

Scar is presented as the sole animal to reject this entrenched feudal society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He laments that "life isn’t fair" and rebels against the "natural" societal order that diminishes him, simply because he lacks the physical attributes of Mufasa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Upon seizing power, Scar initially ushers in an era of equality, placing hyenas on equal footing with lions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. However, despite these seemingly "progressive politics," Scar's intentions are not entirely altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. His song about a new world order incorporates Nazi marching imagery and camera movements directly lifted from Leni Reifenstahl’s *Triumph of the Will* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Ultimately, Scar's reign turns destructive. By interfering with the "natural order" of the food chain, the once prosperous land descends into anarchy and starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This outcome reinforces the film's message that disrupting the established hierarchy leads to disaster.

## Restoration and Continuity

After Scar's defeat, Simba assumes his rightful place as king, and the barren wasteland magically transforms back into a "lush paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This restoration signifies the re-establishment of the "circle of life" and the fixed social order, ready for the next generation to perpetuate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

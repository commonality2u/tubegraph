Dan Harmon, co-showrunner of *Rick and Morty*, states that every story, from *The Odyssey* to a simple fart joke, follows eight steps [01:44:09]. Harmon calls this framework "the story embryo" [01:50:00].

## The Story Embryo (General/Movie Structure)

The eight steps of Harmon's story embryo are:
1.  A character is in a zone of comfort [01:54:00].
2.  But they want something [01:57:00].
3.  They enter an unfamiliar situation [02:00:00].
4.  Adapt to it [02:03:00].
5.  Get what they wanted [02:05:00].
6.  Pay a heavy price for it [02:07:00].
7.  Then return to their familiar situation [02:10:00].
8.  Having changed [02:14:00].

This structure can vary based on genre and medium [02:16:00].

## The Story Circle for Television

While a movie's goal is to provide a 90-minute high, television aims to keep viewers watching indefinitely [02:21:00]. Harmon suggests this is to put the brain in a "vegetative state" for commercials [02:30:00]. This means television shows are less about character change and more about preserving the status quo [02:35:00]. Harmon states that television "swaps out any meaningful and therefore potentially television-subverting truth with the basic, eternal "truth" that change is unnecessary‚Äù [02:55:00].

With this in mind, the structure of a TV episode often looks like this:
1.  "I (the protagonist) [03:09:00]
2.  Notice a small problem [03:12:00].
3.  And make a major decision [03:14:00].
4.  This changes things [03:16:00]
5.  To some satisfaction, but [03:19:00]
6.  There are consequences [03:22:00]
7.  That must be undone [03:24:00]
8.  And I must admit the futility of change" [03:26:00].

## Application in *Rick & Morty*

Showrunners Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland demonstrate mastery of story structure [00:23:00]. Every episode of *Rick and Morty* follows Harmon's television format [03:34:00].

### Example: "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" (Season 2, Episode 6)

The episode "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" serves as an example of this structure:

*   **Step 1: Establish a protagonist in a zone of comfort.** The episode opens with Summer, Rick, and Morty leaving the movie "Ball Fondlers," immediately showing the protagonists and their world [03:44:00].
*   **Step 2: Introduce a small problem and establish a need.** Rick's ship refuses to start due to a problem with the Microverse Battery, creating the central motivation to fix it [04:18:00]. Morty's initial reluctance serves as a narrative trick for audience identification [04:53:00].
*   **Step 3: The protagonist makes a major decision and enters an unfamiliar situation.** Rick and Morty literally shrink down to enter a world inside Rick's car battery, posing as aliens [05:13:00]. This highlights the contrast between their comfort zone and the new, dangerous, and uncertain environment [05:22:00]. This unfamiliar world is populated by Martian-like people who venerate Rick for giving them electricity, unaware that the "Gooble Boxes" Rick provided redirect most of their power to his ship [05:54:00].
*   **Step 4: Characters adapt to the new situation and things must change.** In television, this step focuses on external rather than internal change to preserve the status quo [06:20:00]. Rick and Morty orient themselves in the Microverse and identify the problem: Zeep Xanflorp [06:51:00]. Zeep is a "carbon copy" of Rick who has created his own Microverse, making Rick's Gooble Boxes obsolete [06:58:00]. Despite facing a mirror image of himself, Rick doesn't change, instead shamelessly parroting Morty's earlier objections back to Zeep [07:16:00]. A new conflict is introduced: Rick must find a scientist within Zeep's Microverse who is developing their own Microverse to force Zeep into acknowledging his hypocrisy [07:50:00].
*   **Step 5: The character gets what they wanted.** This is the story's major turning point, where the hero hits rock-bottom but finds what they were looking for [08:17:00]. Rick finds Kyle, a scientist in Zeep's Microverse, who is creating his own Microverse [08:41:00]. This leads to an *Inception*-like moment of a Microverse within a Microverse within another Microverse [08:49:00]. Rick observes Zeep repeat the "slavery with extra steps" rant he had previously heard [08:54:00]. Zeep then realizes his own universe is a Microverse, leading to an existential rage and a fight with Rick [09:10:00]. Meanwhile, Kyle self-destructs from the realization of nesting universes [09:22:00].
*   **Step 6: Paying a hefty price and suffering the consequences.** This step prepares the hero for their return [09:46:00]. Rick's success in exposing Zeep's hypocrisy causes Kyle to have an existential meltdown and commit suicide, trapping Rick and Zeep in the Tinyverse [10:05:00]. Due to their egos, Rick and Zeep blame each other and declare war instead of working together to escape [10:19:00]. Morty, realizing their futility, leaves to live with Tree People [10:33:00].
*   **Step 7: Undoing the damage and returning the familiar world.** This is the final step before the hero resurfaces [10:48:00]. Morty, through his control of the Tree People, forces Rick and Zeep to set aside their egos and engineer an escape from Kyle's Tinyverse [11:09:00]. Once out, they rush to exit the surrounding Microverse [11:16:00]. Zeep, embodying the lower world and serving as Rick's "shadow," tries to stop Rick from bringing change back to the original world [11:23:00]. Zeep acts as a dark reflection of Rick's undesirable traits and is the final obstacle [11:40:00]. Unlike traditional hero narratives where the protagonist battles their inner demons, Rick's confrontation with Zeep is simply "Rick fighting Rick," with Rick being fully aware of his shortcomings and having no desire to fix them [12:10:00].
*   **Step 8: Change or the futility of it.** For television, the hero can never be fully fulfilled to ensure continued adventures [13:13:00]. After Zeep is dealt with, Rick and Morty return to their "Ball Fondlers" reality [12:49:00]. Rick's car starts, as Zeep had to choose between returning to Gooble Box technology or having Rick discard a broken Microverse battery [13:23:00]. The episode ends with Rick, Morty, and Summer eating ice cream, with Morty and Summer shell-shocked by the normalcy after their ordeal [13:40:00]. *Rick and Morty* uses its circular structure to highlight "the depressing, crippling futility of change" [14:13:00]. Rick re-enslaves an entire planet for his car battery, all for ice cream [14:21:00]. The creative team behind *Rick & Morty* "definitely believes in the power story structure" [14:27:00].

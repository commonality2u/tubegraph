The film *Zootopia* explores the central question of [[themes_of_determinism_and_free_will | nature versus nurture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, asking whether identity is biologically determined or if individuals can elevate themselves through nurture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Initial Premise and Challenges

Initially, the film suggests that a "veneer of civilization" is the only thing preventing predators from reverting to a savage state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Nick, a fox, initially bucks negative stereotypes in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, yet his sly nature reappears in private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. When predators begin returning to "primitive ways," biological determinists within the film claim their theories are confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This perspective is articulated with statements like:
> "It may have something to do with... biology." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>

## Resolution and Inversion of Stereotypes

The film's resolution reveals that the predatory behavior was caused by an "obscure poison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> from plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, leading the animals to realize that biology is not to blame for their inherent nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. *Zootopia* then illustrates the fallacy of relying on prejudice by inverting previously established stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:

*   Judyâ€™s childhood fox bully becomes a pacifist pastry chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Flash, initially portrayed as a slow sloth, is revealed to be a speed demon drag racer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   The "dumb bunny" Judy solves the case, and the "sly fox" Nick obtains an honest job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   The meek lamb assistant mayor is exposed as the ruthless mastermind behind the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

This narrative arc challenges the notion of fixed biological traits, suggesting that individuals can transcend perceived inherent characteristics through nurture and choice.

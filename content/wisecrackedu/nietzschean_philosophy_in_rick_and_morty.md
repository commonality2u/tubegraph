In the Season 3 finale of *Rick and Morty*, the series continues to explore the meaninglessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The show frequently emphasizes that "Nothing you think matters matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> and that events happen "infinite times across infinite realities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This presents a unique challenge for character development: how can characters grow when there is no inherent meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>? The show offers a solution that moves beyond simply spiraling deeper into [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, primarily through the growth of Beth Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Beth's Existential Crisis and Freedom

In the episode "The Rickchurian Mortydate," Beth is grappling with the possibility that she might be a clone, questioning if she accepted Rick's offer to be replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This leads her to seek help from Jerry, rekindling their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Rick had previously informed Beth about the implications of her intelligence: "When you know nothing matters the universe is yours and I’ve never met a universe that was into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Rick's typical response to this cosmic indifference is "Don’t think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Faced with this revelation, Beth is granted "radical freedom to choose her destiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This freedom brings her peace, regardless of whether she chooses to stay with or leave her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The episode suggests Beth chooses to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, finding a "newfound sense of happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> by embracing her role as a mother and rekindling her love for Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This shift can be explained through the [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | philosophical theme]] of Amor Fati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Amor Fati: Love of Fate

Amor Fati, a Latin phrase used by Friedrich Nietzsche, means "Love of Fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It is about the affirmation of life, embodying what Nietzsche called a "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This concept is linked to the thought experiment known as "Eternal Recurrence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>:

> [00:04:10] To simplify, imagine a demon shows up and says he’s going to groundhog day your whole life.
> [00:04:15] Do you get thrown into an existential despair because you have to infinitely relive questionable
> [00:04:20] life moments like the popularity of Smash Mouth and frosting your tips in middle school, or
> [00:04:25] do you, to paraphrase Nietzsche, high-five the demon
> [00:04:28] and say you’ve never heard anything more divine.

To embrace the idea of reliving every moment of one's life—the good, the bad, and everything in between—for eternity is the ultimate affirmation of life, demonstrating Amor Fati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This concept is part of Nietzsche's strategy to overcome the crushing [[existentialism_and_nihilism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism]] of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Beth's internal struggle, given her "existential crisis and proclivity for Rick-like disillusionment-causing intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, necessitates confronting her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Her decision to recreate a first date with Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, despite possibly hating her life initially, suggests she becomes a Nietzschean "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This is not about rewriting the past or denying past miseries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>; instead, Amor Fati encourages not shunning the "ugly aspects of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Beth, recognizing she's no longer the woman Jerry married, accepts "simplicity" as a needed antidote to her family's history of using intelligence to justify dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Another "amor fati-esque" moment occurs when Beth believes Rick has come to "retire" her, effectively saying: "Yes, a version of Beth may have chosen to leave, but I embrace being left with my family rather than dwell on what could have been" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Despite the infinite universes with different choices, she chooses to stay in her reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Ubermensch and Meaning-Making

Nietzsche also wrote about the "impossible task of 'knowing oneself'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Beth struggles with this, wanting desperately to know "who I am? What do I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. For Nietzsche, the true motivations behind human actions are often "impenetrable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This can be applied to Rick, whose motivations are rarely clear to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>:

> [00:06:46] "Why would you do that for me?
> [00:06:48] I don't know. Maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe, it makes you matter. Maybe I love you."

Ultimately, whether Beth was cloned or if any of her choices matter in infinite versions of herself, Nietzsche would argue it doesn't matter; the only choice is to love one's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This is the choice Beth appears to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

While Rick is often portrayed as a Nietzschean *Übermensch* — an individual who transcends conventional morality and creates their own values in a meaningless cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> — he often fails to truly create new meaning. Instead, he engages in self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Beth, however, when confronted with the meaninglessness of existence, actively finds happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This act of finding meaning and happiness in the face of the void aligns more closely with the concept of the *Übermensch* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Anakin Skywalker's tragic transformation into [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] is a pivotal narrative in the *Star Wars* saga, driven by an all-consuming fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This descent explores two distinct [[philosophical_responses_to_death_in_star_wars | philosophical responses to death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, ultimately leading a "whiny lil’ shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> to become the Dark Lord of the Sith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Thematic Core: Fear of Death

The fundamental trigger for Anakin Skywalker's turn to [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] is fear, specifically the fear of death and loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, in his 1973 book *The Denial of Death*, argues that much of human action is a means of managing the fear of one's own demise and the demise of loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This anxiety, termed "death denial," is profoundly present in Anakin Skywalker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Childhood Roots of Fear

Anakin's [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | death denial]] is rooted in his childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. From a young age, his distress over his mother's mortality haunts him and evolves into a fixation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Even as a supernaturally gifted child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, potentially the messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, young Anakin is terrified of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Jedi Concerns and Training

Yoda recognized early on that Anakin's fear would be a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The Jedi Council's reluctance to train Anakin due to his age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> suggests a concern about the ramifications of his death denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Psychologist James A. Graham notes that children begin to understand death's permanence between ages 5-9, but only grasp its universal application around age 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. At nine, Anakin is able to understand his mother's mortality and is on the verge of comprehending his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Violence and Control

According to Becker, human violence can be a natural response to [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Inflicting death provides an illusion of control over it, which for Anakin means a path to the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This is foreshadowed in an original script for Episode 1 where Anakin states: "Fear attracts the fearful... He was trying to overcome his fear by squashing you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Anakin's slaughter of the Tusken Raider village after his mother's mortal wounding exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>; killing gives him the illusion of controlling death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The more he kills, the more death feels like something he "owns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## The Choice: Jedi vs. Sith Philosophies

Anakin faces a crucial choice on how to deal with death after he begins having anxiety dreams about Padmé dying in childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This decision highlights the [[contrast_between_jedi_and_sith_attitudes_towards_death | contrast between Jedi and Sith attitudes towards death]] and [[philosophical_responses_to_death_in_star_wars | philosophical responses to death]].

### The Jedi Way: Non-Attachment

When Anakin consults Yoda, he is advised to "Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This counsel aligns with Buddhist principles, specifically the concept of *jaramarana*—the desire to escape old age and death—and the idea that nonattachment is the only way to defeat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Yoda embodies this philosophy, facing his own death with serenity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> and grounding his nonattachment in faith in the light side of the Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### The Sith Way: Embrace Desire and Control

Lacking Yoda's faith, Anakin turns to Palpatine, who offers the Sith approach: embracing desires, in this case, the desire to prevent Padmé's death, which is a form of [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | death denial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Palpatine tempts Anakin with the legend of Darth Plagueis the Wise, suggesting the dark side can enable one to defeat death itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Anakin's Sacrifice and Descent

Anakin chooses the Sith path, becoming a Sith Lord on the condition that Palpatine helps him save Padmé's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. In his refusal to accept death, Anakin sacrifices his name, loyalty, and conscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This path leads him to horrific acts, including killing children and his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Becker describes this as the "terminal point of death denial," where a person "seeks to avoid death, but he does it by killing off so much of himself... that he is actually isolating and diminishing himself and becomes as though dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Left with no one to protect, [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Darth Vader]] becomes merely an instrument of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Obi-Wan's Sacrifice and Transcending Death

Obi-Wan Kenobi's death in Episode IV can be seen as the Jedi Order's way of confronting Anakin's ill-fated choice to deny death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Kenobi's duel with [[darth_vaders_fear_of_death | Vader]] concludes with him offering himself as a sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, stating, "If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This act demonstrates an alternative to Vader's death denial by willingly embracing death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

The ability to "cheat death" for the Jedi, as learned by Qui-Gon Jinn and taught to Obi-Wan and Yoda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, is not about conquering death but transcending it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This allows them to interact with living Jedi as Force ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, a capability even Anakin gains after his redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Luke's Example and Redemption

The [[contrast_between_jedi_and_sith_attitudes_towards_death | discrepancy between death denial and death acceptance]] is further highlighted in how Anakin and Luke confront death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. While Anakin indiscriminately killed to avenge his mother and even caused Padmé's death in his rage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, Luke is willing to give up his own life rather than succumb to the Dark Side or kill his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This willingness to accept death is what truly separates a Jedi from a Sith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

It is only when Anakin follows his son's example, renouncing his own life to save Luke, that he embraces the reality of death and conquers *jaramarana* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

Anakin Skywalker's story illustrates how *jaramarana*, the desire to escape death, can corrupt personality, strip values, and drive terrible actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. According to Becker, death denial is a root cause of human violence, conquest, and the drive to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Evil Empires, both fictional and real, owe their existence to the inability to accept mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. However, accepting the reality of death, regardless of the extent of one's denial, can bring dignity, courage, and compassion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The *Star Wars* saga, through Anakin's journey, suggests it's never too late to come to terms with death, thereby avoiding the allure of the Dark Side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

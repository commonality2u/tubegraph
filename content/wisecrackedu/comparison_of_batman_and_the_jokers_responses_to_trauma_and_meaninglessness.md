From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

Batman and the Joker, two iconic figures from Gotham City, are profoundly shaped by traumatic, world-view-shattering events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Both characters grapple with an existential crisis: how to respond when life destroys one's sense of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Their contrasting reactions to this fundamental question animate the entire Batman universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Batman's Response to Trauma

Batman responds to his parents' death by dressing as a bat and combating criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He chooses to uphold a form of conventional morality as a vigilante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. While typically presented as a response to personal trauma, more recent portrayals of Batman have taken on an increasingly existential tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Batman attempts to convince the Joker to accept conventional morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## The Joker's Embrace of Meaninglessness

In contrast, the Joker's "One Bad Day" leads him to passionately embrace meaninglessness and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He chooses to abandon conventional morality entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. His core philosophy revolves around the idea that if [[jokers_philosophy_of_chaos_and_nihilism | moral nihilism]] is correct, then nothing is inherently right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The Joker endeavors to seduce Batman into abandoning his moral foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Origin Stories and Interconnectedness

The Joker, first appearing in *Batman #1* in 1940, has had his motives range from sadistic to mercenary to inexplicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Despite numerous creative minds working on the character, his outlook has remained surprisingly consistent, representing an extreme reaction to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### The Red Hood and "One Bad Day"

The earliest account of [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film | the Joker’s origin]], in *Detective Comics #168* (1951), describes a two-bit villain called the Red Hood who falls into a vat of chemicals after a fight with Batman, emerging disfigured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

[[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film | Alan Moore’s 1986 magnum opus The Killing Joke]] provided a more tragic origin, portraying the Joker as a reluctant villain who lost his humanity after "One Bad Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This day involved failing as a stand-up comic, learning of his pregnant wife's death, being framed by the mob, and then falling into disfiguring chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The premise of [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film | The Killing Joke]] was for the Joker to turn Commissioner Gordon into a version of himself by inflicting a similarly bad day, aiming to [[the_jokers_role_in_exploring_moral_dilemmas_and_challenging_conventional_morality | prove that even the best of us are never more than one bad day away from becoming, well, whatever the Joker is]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Although non-canonical, [[the_jokers_origin_and_evolution_in_comics_and_film | Alan Moore’s depressing version of the Joker’s origins]] has largely influenced subsequent comics, animated series, and games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Reciprocal Creation

The 1989 film *Batman* explicitly linked their origins: Jack Napier, the mobster who would become the Joker, was the original killer of Batman's parents, and Batman himself later caused Napier to fall into the chemical vat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This narrative suggests they "gave birth to each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

In [[moral_dilemmas_and_justice_in_the_dark_knight | Nolan’s The Dark Knight (2005)]], Batman and the Joker are already fully formed when they meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Heath Ledger's Joker is depicted as an elemental force of [[jokers_philosophy_of_chaos_and_nihilism | chaos]] without a consistent origin story, almost like a demon summoned by Batman's enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. According to the film's world, the Joker's presence in Gotham City is Batman's fault, as his introduction of "oppressive justice and order" imbalances the moral universe and creates an opportunity for a new kind of evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Sociologist Jean Baudrillard's philosophy of societal balance supports this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. He argues that Batman's pursuit of moral progress is impossible because by imposing extreme order, he simultaneously creates a more extreme challenge for criminals to subvert, thereby birthing "a radically antithetical version of Batman’s brand of justice — The Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Batman's attempt to cleanse Gotham of evil inadvertently created a "supergerm," an "autoimmunity disease in the form of The Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

> "To abolish evil is to fall into a worse state than evil itself, that of absolute good." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>

For Baudrillard, evil is not the opposite of good but characterized by a radical indifference to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This description perfectly aligns with the Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Philosophical Underpinnings

According to the French [[the_influence_of_existential_and_philosophical_ideas_on_the_jokers_character | existentialist philosopher Jean- Paul Sartre]], recognizing life's meaninglessness compels individuals to create their own meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. While Batman chooses to [[batman_as_a_force_of_order_versus_morality | uphold some form of conventional morality]], the Joker chooses to abandon it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The villain Two-Face, in contrast, literally flips a coin to decide whether to uphold or rebel against conventional morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### The Joker's "Pathological Sanity"

The Joker is not merely "mentally ill"; his violence stems from an existential problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. He is described as "pathologically sane," having observed the fragility of conventional morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. He believes that everyone is "one sufficiently bad day away from total depravity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Humor as Subversion

The Joker doesn't just abandon traditional moral codes; he subverts them with a sinister humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. He enjoys doing "wretched, horrifying stuff" because it's funny to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. From his perspective, everything is trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. His attempts to tempt people into violating their own sense of right and wrong, thereby exposing their hypocrisy, speak to the essence of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer noted that humor arises from "the sudden apprehension of an incongruity between two things, one of which is actually subsumed under the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Contemporary American philosopher John Marmysz suggests that "laughing at the void can be a really healthy thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. As an "active and even joyfully fanatical [[the_jokers_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_chaos | nihilist]]" who sees it as his duty to confront imposed moral order with the reality of [[jokers_philosophy_of_chaos_and_nihilism | chaos]], the Joker's life centers on identifying incongruities between what we claim to be (moral, righteous) and what he believes we actually are (selfish, savage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. He takes great pleasure in this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## The Joker's Objective: Destroying "Goodness"

The Joker's goal is not merely to cause bad things to happen, but to completely destroy the very concept of what "good" means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. He tries to seduce characters like Batman and Gordon into abandoning their moral foundations and acting in ways they would never perceive as good, thus corrupting their understanding of "goodness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. His mischievous passion for breaking down the division between good and evil is a key part of his intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

His [[the_jokers_role_in_exploring_moral_dilemmas_and_challenging_conventional_morality | objective]] is to reveal that human pretenses to love and morality are phony, and that people are more self-serving than they let on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. His entire villainous career focuses on providing people with the "one bad day" he believes they need to become like him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The Joker's signature weapon, Joker venom, a deadly gas that forces victims to laugh themselves to death with a rictus grin, symbolizes his desire to prove that everyone is capable of becoming what he is, both morally and physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This twisted pleasure and obsession have made him a terrifying and relevant character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

In the end, while Batman often wins the physical fight, the Joker frequently "wins the argument," as seen with Harvey Dent becoming Two-Face, completely indifferent to good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Conclusion

It's easy to relate to the Joker's commitment to proving human hypocrisy when faced with widespread suffering, injustice, and greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Though not heroic, the Joker resonates because humans are suspicious of others' moral codes, fixate on hypocrisy, and sometimes feel the urge to "watch the world burn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

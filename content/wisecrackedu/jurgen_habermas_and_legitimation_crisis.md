The concept of a "legitimation crisis" describes an existential crisis that threatens the foundation of a social system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>. This idea, put forth by political philosopher Jurgen Habermas, suggests that social systems are comprised of governmental, socio-cultural, and economic sub-parts that all interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:01">[02:28:01]</a>.

## Components of a Social System

According to Habermas, a system requires a story or idea to maintain legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:43">[02:40:43]</a>.
*   **Governmental**: Legitimacy can be derived from divine right (monarchies), election by the people (democracies), or constitutions (constitutional governments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:04">[02:45:04]</a>. Even dictators claim legitimacy, often by representing the "will of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:08">[02:55:08]</a>. Economic stability (ensuring citizens are "warm and fed") also helps reduce questions about authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:09">[03:01:09]</a>. A crisis occurs when people no longer feel a system upholds its values, or when those values seem "antiquated and useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:23">[03:15:23]</a>.
*   **Socio-cultural (Lifeworld)**: This refers to the shared practices, beliefs, values, and agreed-upon rules of operation within a cohesive social system, termed a "lebenswelt" or "lifeworld" by Habermas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:48">[04:10:48]</a>. A lifeworld helps create a sense of individual identity by providing values and beliefs through which people make meaning of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:49">[04:50:49]</a>.

## The Star Wars Fandom as a Social System

The Star Wars universe can be analyzed as a social system undergoing a legitimation crisis, particularly following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:04">[04:58:04]</a>.

### The Governmental Shift
George Lucas was initially seen as the "divinely ordained monarch" of the Star Wars universe, whose legitimacy came from creating the franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:12">[03:46:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:07">[04:03:07]</a>. His word was considered "Star Wars law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:40">[04:43:40]</a>. However, with Disney's takeover, some fans perceived a "regime change," replacing "Lord Lucas" with a "money-hungry animated mouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:08">[05:03:08]</a>. This shift in authority from a single creator to a large corporation has led fans to question Disney's legitimacy in developing the franchise's "quasi-holy texts" or canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:15">[07:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:51">[07:16:51]</a>.

### Socio-cultural Disruption
The Star Wars fandom previously functioned as a lifeworld, with shared beliefs, values, characters, stories, and themes originally laid out by Lucas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:05">[04:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:01">[04:26:01]</a>. Disney's controversial decisions, particularly with *The Last Jedi*, were seen by some as "subverting the canon" or "killing the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.
Key changes that caused backlash include:
*   Rey's parents being "nobodies" rather than part of a significant family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>.
*   The "unceremonious death" of Snoke without a storied rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a>.
*   Luke Skywalker's character being depicted as disillusioned and nearly killing his nephew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

Furthermore, Disney "decanonized" hundreds of spin-off novels, radio dramas, video games, and comics that Lucasfilm previously considered part of the "gospel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a>. This "hacking and slashing" of the canon disrupted the community's identity, as fans' identities were "wrapped up in this sh*t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:26">[08:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:54">[08:07:54]</a>.

## [[comparison_to_historical_legitimation_crises | Comparison to Historical Legitimation Crises]]: The Catholic Church Analogy

The crisis in Star Wars fandom is likened to the Catholic Church's legitimation crisis in the 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:04">[05:42:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:19">[05:46:19]</a>. Prior to the 16th century, the Church had total control over the interpretation of the Bible, as few had access to hard copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:38">[05:50:38]</a>. This allowed practices like selling indulgences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:22">[06:07:22]</a>.

However, the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440 enabled rapid reproduction of texts, allowing regular people to read the Bible and develop their own interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:32">[06:16:32]</a>. This crisis emerged because the masses were no longer just consuming religious meaning but also "helping produce canonical interpretations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:16">[06:30:16]</a>. Figures like Martin Luther challenged the Church's authority, posting "95 reasons why the Catholic Church sucked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:18">[06:43:18]</a>.

In this analogy:
*   The original Star Wars universe is the "Bible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:39">[06:58:39]</a>.
*   George Lucas is akin to an "apostle or a prophet" who wrote and interpreted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:18">[07:02:18]</a>.
*   Disney is the "larger and fallible organization" that inherited authority, leading to questioning when they changed "agreed upon values, meanings, and truths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:15">[07:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:15">[07:22:15]</a>.

## The Age of the "Prosumer" and [[audience_complicity_in_media_narratives | Audience Complicity in Media Narratives]]

Today's problem isn't just that people can read; they "blog, tweet, make video essays, produce their own cartoons, and stream content to millions of viewers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:18">[08:20:18]</a>. This phenomenon is termed "prosumerism," a technical term coined by futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler in the 1980s to describe the merging roles of producer and consumer due to modern technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:18">[08:36:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:04">[08:59:04]</a>.

Star Wars fans exemplify prosumers, actively contributing to the universe's meaning through:
*   Sharing YouTube videos and video essays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:35">[09:12:35]</a>.
*   Posting fan theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:23">[09:18:23]</a>.
*   Engaging in online communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:23">[09:18:23]</a>.

This active participation means that fans aren't just consumers but have "helped make the meaning of the Star Wars universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:09">[08:09:09]</a>. The age of the prosumer empowers people to criticize the "anointed successors of Lucas," leading to a situation where filmmakers like James Mangold (director of *Logan*) note that working on big franchises feels like "writing a new chapter of The Bible (w/ the probable danger of being stoned & called a blasphemer)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:15">[09:49:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:19">[10:04:19]</a>.

## Potential Outcomes

Like the Catholic Church, which revised its theology and solidified its community after its legitimation crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:08">[10:23:08]</a>, the Star Wars system may also learn and adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:13">[10:28:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:01">[10:31:01]</a>. The key question remains whether Disney will "evolve in the time of prosumerism" and respect the universe fans have helped create, or if fans will choose to grow with the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:18">[10:50:18]</a>. Alternatively, a "reckoning" could occur, leading to a split similar to the Catholics and Protestants, with competing versions of the franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:18">[11:02:18]</a>.

The *Rick and Morty* episode "Get Schwifty" trivializes aspects of human life, particularly religion, which is often considered sacred by billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While the show frequently depicts Rick's contempt for religion, often reducing it to mere superstition with lines like, "There is no god Summer. Gotta rip that bandaid off now, you'll thank me later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, "Get Schwifty" offers a more complex exploration of how people rationalize such beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The episode provides a [[philosophy_of_rick_and_mortys_get_schwifty_episode | philosophical analysis of "Get Schwifty"]], focusing on the fallacies behind belief structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## The Emergence of Headism

When a giant floating head, a Cromulon, appears and demands "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, Earth experiences widespread natural disasters like earthquakes, sinkholes, fires, and floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The show quickly satirizes the opportunistic nature of organized religion, as churches request more faith and money during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

A new cult called "Headism" forms among those who are unaware that the Cromulons are merely filming a reality show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Without understanding the Cromulons' true purpose, people create a belief system around the giant head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The episode critiques the reasoning behind belief systems themselves, exposing fallacies in various human convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Logical Fallacies and False Causation

The episode primarily highlights two common logical fallacies that [[falsification_and_scientific_method | conflate correlation with causation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Aristotle was the first to document such fallacies, creating a list of arguments that "sounded great but are actually pure ass-clownery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (With This, Therefore Because of This)

This fallacy involves the mistaken belief that one event occurring at the same time as another, unrelated event has a causal connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

*   **Example 1: The Headist Religion's Origin**
    The Headist religion begins when Principal Vagina prays to the Head at the precise moment the cataclysmic events subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The Headists conclude, "Whaddaya know? He was right!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. In reality, the Heads stop because they are pleased with Rick's impromptu performance of "Get Schwifty," a song about dropping your pants and defecating on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Example 2: Principal Vagina's Ascent Attempt**
    Later, Principal Vagina attempts to "ascend" Beth and Jerry, and as the Heads begin to boo, the Headists assume, "Looks like the heads are getting angry!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Again, this is *Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The Heads are actually displeased with Rick's terrible performance without Morty and a nuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (After This, Therefore Because of This)

This fallacy is the idea that because one thing comes before another, it must naturally be the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

*   **Example: The President's Naming Game**
    The President believes that The Dream, Billy Corgan, Randy Newman, and Pharrell are all dead because he named them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

In all these instances, characters with a limited point of view — those unaware of the reality TV show — believe their mundane ceremonies influence the powerful Heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Beth and Jerry occasionally highlight this [[falsification_and_scientific_method | logical fallacy]], noting, "It's possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren't actually related at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## The Psychology of Belief Rationalization

Beyond ridiculing "magical thinking," the episode makes a deeper point: people don't simply fall into silly beliefs due to pure irrationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Instead, they *over-rationalize* their thinking to the point of absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Cognitive psychologists suggest that pseudo-scientific belief systems, like doomsday cults or conspiracy theories, are resilient because they are sustained by the structure of the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. These systems persist and spread through appeals to rationality, not through deception or mass stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The human brain is hard-wired to seek logical conclusions and easy explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

> "Ma'am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you wanna play checkers?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
> "Let's be rational! I'll see you at God's house!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

People tend to believe what aligns with their existing worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This is explained by [[confirmation_bias_and_belief_rationalization | confirmation bias]]: the tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms one's own beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. [[confirmation_bias_and_belief_rationalization | Confirmation bias]] also explains why individuals may overlook flaws in their belief systems for personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

*   **Example: Summer's Well-being**
    Even as the Headists sacrifice "unwantables" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, Summer's parents, Beth and Jerry, rationalize their participation in the cult. Despite a plea for help from someone being sacrificed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, they dismiss it because "Summer is doing really well here. She's not getting pregnant, or doing drugs, or missing curfew..." and "That's not our business as long as Summer is thriving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Universal Tendency to Rationalize

These fallacies and biases are not exclusive to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. "Post hoc rationalization" is an inherent part of the human cause-and-effect thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The audience itself can fall prey to these tendencies, as seen in Rick's snake and wristwatch trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Rick's trick plays on the brain's desire to attribute event A as the cause of event B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, when in reality, it's a "particle beam in the wristwatch" and a "snake holster on the leg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

While "Get Schwifty" delivers the irony that grand cosmic events can be inaccurately interpreted to form beliefs, exposing how a religion can be built on something as mundane as a reality TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, it also questions humanity's ability to make predictions and fully understand existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This willingness to challenge even the nature of belief itself sets *Rick and Morty* apart in contemporary satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

*The Office*, though off the air for over six years, remains one of the most streamed shows, soon transitioning to NBC's streaming platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Its enduring [[the_popularity_of_the_office_and_its_cultural_impact | popularity]] is partly attributed to its portrayal of "BS" – the prevalent nonsense that has infiltrated professional lives and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Unlike shows like *Friends* where characters seemingly "do nothing all day" in a cafe, *The Office* depicts characters sitting around "doing nothing all day but this time at a desk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Dunder Mifflin: A Mockumentary on Pointless Work

*The Office* is a mockumentary series set in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of Dunder Mifflin, a struggling paper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The branch is led by Michael Scott, whose antics frequently distract his employees from their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Subsequent managers continue this tradition of distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

On the surface, *The Office* centers on individuals coping with unsatisfying jobs and uncomfortable bosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It also satirizes [[workplace_dynamics_and_character_archetypes_in_the_office | familiar office archetypes]], such as:
*   The uptight accountant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   The chatterbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   The attractive receptionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   The person waiting for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   The unlovable HR rep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
*   The lovable dunce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
*   "That guy who went to Cornell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

The show also reflects anxieties about the evolving American economy, particularly the effects of digitization, e-commerce, and retail consolidation in the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Graeber's Theory of BS Jobs

This economic context leads to the concept of "BS jobs," an argument put forth by [[anthropologist_david_graebers_theory_on_bs_jobs | anthropologist David Graeber]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Graeber defines a BS job as:
> "a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless unnecessary or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though as part of the conditions of employment the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

This definition captures the essence of life at Dunder Mifflin, characterized by:
*   Useless meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   Jobs nearing obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Following random directives from superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Desperate attempts to find meaning in it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>

While some Dunder Mifflin employees like Oscar and Angela perform real, competent work, many aspects align with Graeber's criteria for a BS job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Employees are often aware of the general pointlessness of their work, as Dunder Mifflin struggles to compete with modern chains and fails to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Even under threat of downsizing, much of the workday is consumed by trivial activities like discussing streamer colors, "Flonkerton," or office romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Employee Coping Mechanisms and the Pursuit of "Being the Cause"

With few exceptions, most employees at Dunder Mifflin do not seem to enjoy their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Jim** fills his time with distractions, primarily by playing pranks on Dwight, despite being praised for his intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. He has been repeatedly offered promotions despite his lack of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Pam** spends her work hours planning her wedding and conspiring with Jim, even inventing a job for herself to avoid being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Kevin**, an accountant who can barely do math, remains employed for years because firing him would be "uncomfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Andy** as manager spends months away from the office unnoticed, indicating the job's superfluity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Graeber notes that people derive pleasure from "being the cause," or having an effect on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Pointless jobs, however, strip away this pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Dostoevsky's theory of torture — endlessly performing a pointless task — is invoked to describe the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Many Dunder Mifflin employees are thwarted from "being the cause" by management, bureaucracy, or the inanity of tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Characters cope with their pointless professional lives in various ways:
*   **Jim** experiences agency through his pranks on Dwight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Pam** copes through distraction, love, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Stanley** endures for "pretzel day" and the hope of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Oscar** runs for state senate, seeking a role where he can effect change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Kevin** finds happiness running a bar where he can competently bring joy to guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Michael Scott and the Perpetuation of Nonsense

**Michael Scott** often denies the superfluous nature of his job, convincing himself of its paramount importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. His hatred for Toby, the HR representative, seems to stem from Toby infringing on Michael's ability to "be the cause" in his own office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Michael's need for love and respect, rooted in a lonesome childhood, drives his non-stop narcissism and demands for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. He grasps at meaning by framing his job in grandiose terms, emulating figures he deems important like Abraham Lincoln or Wayne Gretzky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The mockumentary style of the show further emphasizes Michael's posturing for the cameras, aiming to portray himself as an admired leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

**Dwight Schrute** on the other hand, embraces the inanity and bureaucracy, using it to serve his warped view of "being the cause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Despite a successful beet farm, he fixates on bureaucratic titles and the appearance of authority, aiming to become a "petty dictator" with ultimate say in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## The Paradox of BS Jobs in a Market Economy

In 2013, the year *The Office* concluded, a Harvard Business Review survey found that half of 12,000 professionals felt their job lacked meaning, and another poll indicated 37% of British workers considered their jobs "utterly useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Graeber suggests these jobs persist despite seeming antithetical to capitalism, which theoretically should eliminate such waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Societally, there's a reluctance to admit this possibility, drawing a parallel to the Soviet Union inventing jobs to ensure full employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

The proliferation of BS jobs, according to Graeber, is linked to the rise of the service economy, particularly in administrative, consulting, clerical, accounting, and IT roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Graeber categorizes BS jobs into several types:
*   **Flunkies:** Employees existing to justify a manager's position or inflate prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Goons:** Roles existing solely because other companies have them (e.g., legal or marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Duct-tapers:** Those who clean up the messes of inefficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Michael humorously identifies himself as "the toilet of this office," flushing away annoying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Box-takers:** Roles existing to verify work that isn't actually being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Task-masters:** Those who create BS work for other BS employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

As a company that primarily sells paper rather than manufacturing it, Dunder Mifflin squarely fits within this service economy, justifying its higher prices through customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Michael's stated goal to "hire people and inspire people" is less about business growth and more about his need to create a "pseudo family" that fulfills his desire to be loved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

Ultimately, *The Office* resonates because its characters successfully cope with their circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. It serves as an escapist fantasy where employees are not fired for minimal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. By the finale, they have all managed to endure the "BS," either by finding love or simply leaving, suggesting that coping might involve finding a better job or a fulfilling domestic life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

## Plot Overview

The narrative begins with Nick Carraway, an Ivy League graduate, renting a house in Long Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. His neighbor is the affluent playboy, [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan | Jay Gatsby]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Nick frequently spends time with his cousin, [[character_analysis_of_jay_gatsby_and_daisy_buchanan | Daisy Buchanan]], and her husband, Tom Buchanan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Unknown to Daisy, Tom is having an affair with a woman named Myrtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, who is married to George <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

During a visit to Gatsby's residence, Nick learns that Daisy was once Gatsby's romantic interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Gatsby's relocation to Long Island was driven by his desire to rekindle their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

A pivotal confrontation occurs when the group travels to Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. At the Plaza Hotel, Tom expresses his anger about Daisy and Gatsby's relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Gatsby and Tom argue, forcing Daisy to choose between them, a decision she struggles to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Later, George confronts Myrtle about her infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. As Daisy drives Gatsby's car back to Long Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, Myrtle runs into the path of the vehicle and is killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Daisy then drives away, leaving Gatsby behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Upon learning of Myrtle's death, Tom falsely informs George that Gatsby was the driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Believing Gatsby was also Myrtle's lover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, George shoots Gatsby while he is in his pool, then takes his own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Following these tragic events, Nick decides to leave New York and return to the Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Themes and Motifs

### [[critique_of_the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | Criticism of the American Dream]]
*The Great Gatsby* can be interpreted as a [[critique_of_the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | criticism of the anti-Calvinistic image of the American Dream]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While America was initially envisioned as a place of mutual support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, Fitzgerald's depiction of America is characterized by betrayal, which renders Gatsby's romanticized [[critique_of_the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | dream]] absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Despite this, Gatsby remains committed to his American ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. According to Minter, "Because of the beauty of his dream and the heroism of his efforts to move beyond it, Gatsby can be made great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby | Dreams vs. Reality]]
A prominent [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby | motif]] in the novel is the tension between [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby | dreams and reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Gatsby harbors grand delusions about his future with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. He believes that the past can be repeated, but this is a mistaken notion as time cannot be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Fitzgerald subtly highlights this [[motifs_of_dreams_versus_reality_in_the_great_gatsby | motif]] through small details; for instance, Gatsby owns a large collection of books, most of which he has not read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This suggests Gatsby's attempts to project an image of intelligence that doesn't align with his true reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby | The Green Light]]
The [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby | green light]] is a key [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby | symbol]] in the novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Some interpretations suggest it [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby | symbolizes]] the diminishing optimism of Gatsby's dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Early in the book, the [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby | green light]] possesses an intense quality that fuels Gatsby's aspirations for a relationship with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, by the end, it is merely an ordinary [[symbolism_in_the_great_gatsby | green light]], reflecting the fading and unfulfilled nature of his dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

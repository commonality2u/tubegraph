## Plot Synopsis

### Nick Carraway's Arrival
The story is narrated by [[characters_and_relationships_in_the_the_great_gatsby | Nick Carraway]], an Ivy League graduate who rents a house in Long Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. His neighbor is the wealthy [[characters_and_relationships_in_the_the_great_gatsby | Jay Gatsby]], a playboy with considerable money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Across the bay, Nick's cousin, [[characters_and_relationships_in_the_the_great_gatsby | Daisy]], lives with her husband, [[characters_and_relationships_in_the_the_great_gatsby | Tom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Unbeknownst to Daisy, Tom is having an affair with [[characters_and_relationships_in_the_the_great_gatsby | Myrtle]], who is married to [[characters_and_relationships_in_the_the_great_gatsby | George]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Gatsby's Past and Pursuit
During a visit to Gatsby's home, Nick learns that Daisy was once Gatsby's lover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Gatsby moved to Long Island specifically hoping to rekindle their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### The Confrontation and Tragedy
The group of wealthy individuals decides to take a trip to Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. At the Plaza Hotel, Tom confronts Gatsby about his relationship with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Gatsby and Tom demand that Daisy choose between them, but she is unable to make a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Meanwhile, back in their neighborhood, George confronts Myrtle about her infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Myrtle, in turn, berates George <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Later, while Daisy is driving Gatsby's car back to Long Island, Myrtle suddenly runs into the street and is fatally hit by the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Daisy drives away without stopping and decides to end her relationship with Gatsby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Aftermath
Upon learning of the murder, Tom falsely tells George that Gatsby was driving the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Believing Gatsby was also Myrtle's lover, George goes to Gatsby's house, shoots him while he is in his pool, and then takes his own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. After these events, Nick decides to leave New York and return to the Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Major Themes and Motifs

### [[the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | The American Dream]]
"The Great Gatsby" can be seen as a critique of an anti-Calvinistic view of [[the_american_dream_in_the_great_gatsby | The American Dream]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While America might have started as a place of mutual support, Fitzgerald's depiction of America is characterized by betrayal, making Gatsby's romantic pursuit seem futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Despite this, Gatsby remains true to his American ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. As Minter states, Gatsby's greatness stems from "the beauty of his dream and the heroism of his efforts to move beyond it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### [[motifs_in_the_great_gatsby | Dreams vs. Reality]]
A significant [[motifs_in_the_great_gatsby | motif]] in the novel is the contrast between dreams and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Gatsby harbors grand illusions about his future with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, believing that the past can be repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, the narrative suggests that no one can truly reclaim past times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Fitzgerald subtly embeds this [[motifs_in_the_great_gatsby | motif]] in details, such as Gatsby's large collection of unread books, which suggests he is merely trying to appear intelligent rather than genuinely being so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### [[symbolism_of_the_green_light_in_the_great_gatsby | Symbolism of the Green Light]]
The [[symbolism_of_the_green_light_in_the_great_gatsby | green light]] is a key symbol in the novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Some interpretations suggest it symbolizes the dwindling optimism of Gatsby's dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Early in the book, the green light has a vibrant quality that fuels Gatsby's desire to be with Daisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. By the novel's end, it has become an ordinary green light, losing its special significance, much like Gatsby's unfulfilled dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

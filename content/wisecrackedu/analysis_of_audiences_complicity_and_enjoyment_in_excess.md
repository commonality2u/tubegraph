*The Wolf of Wall Street* critiques society's complicity in the excesses portrayed by the character of Jordan Belfort, suggesting that audiences, and culture at large, share in the responsibility for such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The film's final shot, a simple push-in and crane-up, is interpreted to change the entire meaning of the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## The Shift in Tone
Throughout most of its runtime, *The Wolf of Wall Street* uses poppy, upbeat music to highlight Jordan Belfort's debauchery and excess, including his yacht, women, drugs, and parties, all funded by defrauding investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This portrayal exists despite Belfort's eventual arrest and a four-year prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. However, unlike many films where corrupt figures face severe consequences, *The Wolf of Wall Street* avoids overt moralizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>; Belfort's prison term is depicted as a "cakewalk," and he doesn't serve his full sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. The film's conclusion suggests that "nothing has changed": Belfort continues to sell, and people continue to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

The final shot notably shifts to solemn, meditative music, contrasting with the film's earlier upbeat soundtrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This change prompts reflection on the film's broader message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## Audience as a Mirror
One interpretation of the final shot is that it holds a mirror up to the moviegoers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The backlight in the seminar scene evokes a projector shining on an audience, implying that viewers are implicated in the film's critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. While it may seem easy to place blame solely on Jordan Belfort for the film's moral depravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, the final shot suggests that the blame extends to the audience and the cultural environment that enables and encourages such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Belfort himself articulates this societal desire, stating that potential clients "want to get rich and they want to get rich quickly. They all want something for nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The film suggests that Belfort's scams would not succeed if the audience did not share in this "dream of getting rich quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Director Martin Scorsese is understood to be challenging the audience directly, as viewers have spent three hours reveling in Jordan's exploits and laughing with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. The lack of punishment for Jordan in the film's ending reflects the audience's own complicity, as they "revel in everything he does, living vicariously through him, wishing that we could live his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. This serves as a [[critique_of_cultural_complicity_in_financial_wrongdoing | critique of cultural complicity in financial wrongdoing]].

## Voluntary Submission and Perverse Enjoyment
The film's ending also suggests a more sinister possibility: that people actually enjoy being taken advantage of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Referencing French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard, the narration posits that the masses might find a "perverse enjoyment" in their "banal existence" under the influence of figures like Jordan Belfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Lyotard's ideas suggest that individuals might voluntarily submit to exploitation, enjoying the "mad destruction of their organic bodies" and the "decomposition of their personal identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This implies a deeper, almost masochistic, cultural acceptance of systems that exploit them.

Ultimately, *The Wolf of Wall Street* is presented as a "true totem of our culture of excess," defying easy answers and highlighting the complexity of societal attitudes towards financial wrongdoing and hedonistic pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Its [[exploration_of_hedonism_and_disillusionment | exploration of hedonism and disillusionment]] underscores the audience's role in perpetuating the culture it depicts.

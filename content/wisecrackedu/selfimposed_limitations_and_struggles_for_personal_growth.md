The anime *Mob Psycho 100*, created by ONE (also known for *One-Punch Man*), explores the meaning of a fulfilling life by examining the unique challenges faced by an overpowered protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unlike Saitama from *One-Punch Man*, Shigeo Kageyama, known as Mob, manages to find satisfaction in life despite his immense psychic abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The series suggests that genuine personal growth and happiness stem from embracing challenges and understanding one's limitations, rather than relying solely on innate gifts.

## Mob's Path to Fulfillment

Mob is a middle schooler with near-godlike psychic powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Early on, his mentor, Reigen Arataka, advises him never to use his powers against other human beings, warning that misusing such great power could lead to self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. Mob strives to live a normal middle school life, often repressing the rage that fuels his powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

While having psychic powers might seem advantageous, Mob's reluctance to use them is central to his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Other espers, such as Teru, the "shadow leader" of a rival school gang, use their powers to bully others and gain superficial attention, respect, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Dimple, a power-hungry ghost, bluntly states that Teru uses his psychic powers for a "good life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. However, Mob rejects this "superficially perfect life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, preferring to earn a more fulfilling existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He believes an easy life built entirely on innate gifts would be "pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>, as the things he truly desires, like muscles, understanding girls, or reading the room, require effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## The Philosophical Role of Limitations: Edmund Burke's Sublime

Mob's perspective aligns with Irish philosopher Edmund Burke, known for his description of "the sublime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The sublime is the feeling of experiencing oneself as infinitesimally small in the face of vast, uncontrollable forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. It suspends or destroys egocentricity through a display of overwhelming power or grandeur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Burke believed such experiences are vital for a healthy life because they force us to engage mental and spiritual capacities that remind us we are not at the universe's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

A life spent avoiding challenging scenarios, which make the experience of the sublime possible, can quickly become unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Burke argued that the sublime exercises parts of our minds and bodies that "tense up" in response to fear, which are vital for well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. He stated that "Labour [is] a thing absolutely requisite to make us pass our lives with tolerable satisfaction," and that "Melancholy, dejection, despair, and often self-murder" can result from a "relaxed state of body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Getting too "relaxed" about one's place in the universe leads to unhappiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

## The Espers' Delusion and Mob's Embrace of Struggle

The majority of espers in *Mob Psycho 100* fall into the trap of self-importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. They exhibit a massive sense of entitlement, believing they are "main characters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This, however, leaves them miserable when reality doesn't conform to their false sense of deserving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Mob points out that if their psychic powers were taken away, "there'll be nothing left. You'll be empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Their dependence on powers for identity makes them unable to tolerate challenges to their self-image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

Teru is a clear example of this [[the_role_of_toxic_traits_in_personal_identity | toxic trait]]. He becomes frustrated when Mob doesn't fight back, revealing his fragility and dependence on his powers for everything to go "just the way I wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Mob's refusal to fight is perceived as an assault on Teru's self-perception as a worthy opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Mob recognizes that Teru, like himself, lacks self-confidence beyond his psychic powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

The espers' abilities are a double-edged sword: unchecked, they foster a belief in inherent superiority, leading to deep dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. What they need, according to the show's philosophy, is a reality check â€“ an overwhelming experience with the sublime to humble their egos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

### The Impact of the Sublime on Espers

When Mob defeats Teru, Teru is overwhelmed by Mob's power, experiencing the terror that Burke identifies as a key component of the sublime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. For the first time, Teru feels utter helplessness and the fear of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. Cast into the sky, dwarfed by clouds and an endless vista, he finds peace in the realization that he is "just an average person after all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. This visual is reminiscent of classical Romantic art, which depicted small human subjects facing vast, overwhelming forces of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

Similarly, Reigen exposes other powerful espers, the "Scars," to the sublime by crushing their delusions of grandeur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Using a combination of Mob's transferred powers and his own rhetoric, Reigen puts them in perspective, reminding them they are "nothing more than a commoner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. This forceful dragging back to reality provides them a taste of the sublime, guiding them toward a healthier, more mature mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. For these espers, freedom comes from realizing their human vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. As the theme song suggests, "If everyone is not special," "Maybe you can be what you want to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

## Mob's Own Struggle and Growth

Mob wants to do the difficult "labour" of integrating himself into the world and society, rather than trying to transcend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. He actively seeks [[holdens_struggle_with_adulthood_and_society | personal growth]] by joining the Body Improvement Club to improve his physical abilities and social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. The club members, like Burke, view "surmounting of difficulties" as key to a fulfilling life, choosing to challenge their weakest parts rather than relying on innate strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. Mob also admires his brother Ritsu, who achieves much without psychic powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

However, Mob himself is plagued by a "delusional self-image," albeit a more benevolent one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. As a 14-year-old, he believes he must be in total control of his world, profoundly responsible for everything that happens during his unconscious psychic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. This leads him to repress his emotions, fearing he will be overwhelmed by rage, which paradoxically gives him less control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. The weight of this responsibility causes him immense pain and a feeling of powerlessness from contradictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. His "meager attempt at resistance towards himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a> reveals his clinging to an image of himself as the main "mover and shaker" of his world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

It takes Reigen, an adult Mob respects, to remind him that he is just a kid and doesn't always have to bear the world on his shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. Reigen tells him it's "okay to run away" when things go south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. This idea shocks Mob, providing him with a Burkean "astonishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. It allows him to feel his own insignificance, temporarily transfer his powers to Reigen, and finally come to terms with his abilities, setting him on the path to living a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Both *One-Punch Man* and *Mob Psycho 100* prompt reflection on what constitutes a good life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. Saitama's and Mob's struggles with their overwhelming powers illustrate that a fulfilling existence is not simply about getting whatever one wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. In the "ONE-iverse," happiness is achieved through deliberate struggle and [[personal_growth | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. As Mob's internal monologue states, "fight on fight on fight on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. The series champions the idea that self-imposed limitations and challenges, rather than innate power, are the true catalysts for personal growth and satisfaction.

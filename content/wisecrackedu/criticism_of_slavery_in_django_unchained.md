Quentin Tarantino's *Django Unchained* offers a clever, nuanced, and even fun [[cultural_critique_in_cinema | criticism]] of slavery, going beyond its surface as a typical Tarantino film with violence and stylized dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While the film includes elements like revenge porn of a former slave burning down a Southern plantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, it also provides three more subtle commentaries on slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## You Can’t Cover Ugly with Civilization

*Django Unchained* critiques the dehumanizing logic of slavery by subverting the supposed superiority of white "civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The film directly challenges the racist binary where white bodies represent culture and civilization, and black bodies are deemed uncivilized and incapable of proper language or cultural appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Dr. King Schultz, an eloquent German bounty hunter, speaks English so well that he confounds native-speaking slavers, making them appear "wildly uncivilized" by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. His rhetorical skills allow him to talk circles around the "simpletons of the American South" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Schultz serves as an "emblem of the mythical European civilization" that Southern men of means claimed their plantations were built upon, exposing their claims as "full of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

This critique extends to the historical justification of slavery. The idea that slaves were incapable of proper language traces back to Aristotle, who distinguished humans from animals by "logos" (speech and reason) versus "phonos" (animal sounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Aristotle used this to justify slavery in Greece, claiming slaves could only receive "logos" but not possess it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. *Django Unchained* flips this dichotomy, portraying cruel slavers mumbling incoherently while slaves speak clearly and intelligibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

The film also contrasts how Schultz treats slaves with how other white people do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Schultz uses the honorific "Fraulein" when addressing Broomhilde, unlike the prevalent use of racial slurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. In contrast, Calvin Candie demands the French honorific "Monsieur" despite not speaking French, using titles as a form of mandatory submission rather than voluntary respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Symbolism like beer also highlights this contrast:
*   Schultz buys Django a beer, symbolizing a transition from a free man-slave relationship to that of coworkers sharing a drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   Candie orders a beer for one of his fighters after a victory, but this is a "sick sort of reward" for an enslaved man forced to murder another for the entertainment of slave owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
One beer represents shared humanity, while the other represents "cold-blooded savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

Even the "multilingual European man of culture" (Schultz) is not entirely civilized; he is a bounty hunter who kills for a living and buys Django for self-interest, acknowledging it as a pragmatic, not moral, act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The film's peak contrast is seen with Calvin Candie, who appropriates European culture (demanding "Monsieur," attempting German) but remains a "savage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Schultz reaches his boiling point when a woman plays Beethoven, finding it unbearable to see a product of his culture appropriated by such people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The film also critiques the use of the Christian Bible to justify slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. One of the Brittle brothers quotes Genesis 9:2 while preparing to whip a slave, wearing a Bible page pinned to his shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Django's bullet through the page exposes the "bloody hypocrisy of using Christianity to justify savagery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, specifically targeting the idea that slaves are "less than human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Using the Symbols of Slavery to Make Slavery Look Stupid

The film uses various cultural elements—from fashion to music and iconography—to flip the logic of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Inspired by figures like Joseph Cinque, who led the Amistad Rebellion and was portrayed in media as a noble from the culture that enslaved him, *Django Unchained* uses similar subversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Django's "Three Musketeers" outfit, given to him by Schultz, is "deliberately abrasive" for anyone who would reserve such attire for a white, civilized man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. His horseback riding, historically associated with the well-to-do, also draws ire or surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. In a final act, Django wears Candie’s clothes while orchestrating the plantation's destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

This aligns with José Esteban Muñoz's concept of "disidentification," a strategy of acting against a dominant ideology by mangling its symbols from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Django dons aristocratic attire not to become a Southern Gentleman but to "abuse the very notion" of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This is paralleled by artist Kehinde Wiley, who paints Harlem residents in the style of classic European art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Tarantino also manipulates the soundtrack:
*   **Rap Music**: The use of rap music, seemingly anachronistic for a mid-19th-century Western, makes "perfect sense" as rap has long been used by those facing racial and economic inequality to call for fighting "the powers that be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Songs like "100 Black Coffins" by Rick Ross and Jamie Foxx express themes of revenge and changing circumstances, highlighting Django's journey of seeking power and revenge under oppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Opera (Wagner)**: Schultz interprets Django’s quest to rescue Broomhilde through Richard Wagner’s "Twilight of the Gods," positioning Django as the Siegfried of his own revenge story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Django can be seen as a Nietzschean "ubermensch" who responds to the "nihilistic values of slavery and white supremacy" by metaphorically and literally burning the system to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The destruction of Candyland mirrors Wagner's world-burning, symbolizing a call for the destruction of slavery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Furthermore, Tarantino consciously uses a narrative (Wagner's Ring Cycle) once appropriated by Nazis to support white supremacy, now to tell a slavery revenge narrative that destroys white supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

Finally, Tarantino uses the Western genre itself for symbolic subversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. In a genre typically featuring "strong jawed white dudes" killing villainized Native Americans, *Django Unchained* portrays white cowboy types being "taken out by a freed slave," a subject largely ignored in the Western canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Acting Out of Slavery

The film explores the role of acting as a primary means for slaves to exert [[themes_of_agency_and_acting_in_the_context_of_slavery | agency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. While academic debates exist on the extent of slave agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, *Django Unchained* emphasizes how deliberate performance provides a means of resistance.

Django's mission to trick Candie and save Broomhilde relies on him "playing a character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, including his specific wardrobe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. His [[critique_of_character_agency_in_the_film | agency]] is expressed through the decisions he makes within this role, such as berating other slaves, lashing out at Candie's crew, and even sitting by as a runaway slave is killed by dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. These decisions are presented as pragmatic choices made out of "necessity of his own survival" within the scope of limited agency <a class="yt
-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Django later uses this acting range to outsmart a gang of Australians, putting on a convincing performance with props to regain his freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

The most striking example of [[themes_of_agency_and_acting_in_the_context_of_slavery | agency]] through acting is Candie’s head house slave, Stephen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Stephen, who despises Django likely out of envy for his freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, also employs "dramatic arts for personal gain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. He performed his way out of harsh field labor into the "relative comfort of Candie’s home" and can even disagree with his master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Stephen's "performed laughter" at Candie's jokes is a calculated move to gain trust and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. His influence is evident when he, not Candie, realizes Schultz and Django's true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Stephen also uses non-verbal acting, faking a limp and using a fake cane to appear physically weak and disarm suspicions about his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. While Stephen is a villain who serves his white master's interests, the film contextualizes his choices within the brutal system of slavery, suggesting he might not have had "any other way to get some sort of freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. He is trying to manifest power with the "cards he was dealt," which "truly suck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

Ultimately, *Django Unchained* is presented as a sharp [[cultural_critique_in_cinema | criticism]] of slavery and white supremacy, going beyond its initial appearance as an irreverent Western <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

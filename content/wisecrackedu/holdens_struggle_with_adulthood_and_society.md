J.D. Salinger's *The Catcher in the Rye* tells the story of [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden Caulfield]], a 16-year-old boy recounting the events that led to him being in a mental hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The narrative primarily illustrates [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden's journey]] to find stability and acceptance in a society he perceives as "broken" and full of "faking" people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. When he fails to find this, he attempts to "buck the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Disillusionment with the Adult World

[[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] is deeply critical of what he sees as the "fake-ass" nature of adults and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. He views most people as "phonies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This perspective drives his desire to remain in a "pure world of children," distinct from the adult world he despises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### The Catcher in the Rye Symbolism
[[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] envisions himself as a "catcher in the rye," standing in a field of rye to prevent children from falling off a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Literally, he wants to save kids from physical harm, but figuratively, he aims to save them from the "bent-ass shit of adulthood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Despite knowing he cannot stop the inevitable transition from childhood to adulthood, he intends to resist it for himself and others for as long as he can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### The Hunting Hat
The act of wearing his hunting hat backward symbolizes [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden's]] values being the "reverse of the rest of society's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This posture is akin to how baseball catchers wear their hats, foreshadowing his role as the "Catcher in the Rye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### The Museum
[[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden's]] fascination with the glass cases in the museum signifies his desire to avoid becoming a "fake-ass adult" and to "freeze time," much like the plastic figures behind the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Loneliness and Internal Conflict
[[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden's]] "legit desire to search for beauty in human contact" goes unfulfilled in a world he perceives as ugly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This makes him "one of the loneliest playas in all of literature," as he "keeps it so real, while errybody else frontinâ€™" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Despite his righteous talk, [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] admits to being "the most terrific liar you ever saw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Although he projects a tough exterior, he possesses a gentle soul, evident in his repeated concern for the ducks in the Central Park lake when the water freezes over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Connection with Phoebe
[[the_role_of_phoebe_and_holdens_connection_with_children | His younger sister, Phoebe]], is the only person with whom [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden]] feels he can "keep it real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. She challenges him, asking what he wants to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, and later tells him to "shut his trap" when he tries to leave without her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Their connection is highlighted by [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden's]] enjoyment of watching her on the carousel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Consequences
Ultimately, [[holden_caulfields_journey_and_mental_health | Holden's]] inability to reconcile his gentle nature with a world he perceives as twisted by deceit leads him to "pay the price," spending his days in a psych ward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

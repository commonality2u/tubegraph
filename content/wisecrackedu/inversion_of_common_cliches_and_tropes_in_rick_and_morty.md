From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

`Rick and Morty` frequently utilizes and then subverts common cliches and tropes from various genres, including sci-fi, horror, and fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Many of these references move beyond simple homage, offering thought-provoking and insightful inversions that highlight the show's cleverness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. By deconstructing these familiar narratives, `Rick and Morty` often challenges audience expectations and explores deeper [[philosophical_themes_in_rick_and_morty | philosophical themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Demystifying the "Deal with the Devil"

In the episode "Something Ricked This Way Comes," `Rick and Morty` inverts the traditional "deal with the devil" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   **References**: The episode title itself is a nod to Ray Bradbury’s novel "Something Wicked This Way Comes," which features characters making deals with strange carnival folk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The Devil's shop in `Rick and Morty` is named "Needful Things," a direct reference to Stephen King’s novel where people are tricked into buying items at low cost in exchange for pranks that incite civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Traditional Trope**: Stories about making deals with the devil typically reflect the hidden, negative consequences of trying to subvert the "natural order of things" to fulfill selfish desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. What is presented as "too good to be true" is often shorthand for "don't circumvent God’s rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **`Rick and Morty`'s Inversion**: In contrast, the Devil’s items in `Rick and Morty` are free but creatively ruin the intended benefit, such as a microscope that makes Rick too stupid to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, Rick undermines the entire premise by simply reverse-engineering the Devil's cursed items, allowing people to have what they want without repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This demonstrates that with science, "there are no mystical repercussions for messing with the perceived order of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Rick effectively "demystifies" the "deal with the devil" as a "paranoid fairy tale," rendering the Devil obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This highlights a scary world where karmic retribution is absent, and pure, disinterested science is the true horror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Challenging Conformity and Individualism

"Auto Erotic Assimilation" explores popular fears of conformity to critique basic values and Rick’s psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

*   **References**: The episode centers on Rick’s ex-girlfriend, Unity, a hivemind collective that assimilates alien races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This is a direct reference to the 1956 film "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," which depicts aliens replacing people with emotionless replicas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" has been interpreted as a commentary on the threat of the Soviet Union and the loss of individualism under Communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Traditional Trope**: The "body snatchers" trope typically projects anxiety about collectivism destroying individualism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **`Rick and Morty`'s Inversion**: `Rick and Morty` inverts this by showing that the "freedom we associate with individualism can actually kind of suck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The inhabitants liberated from Unity's hivemind recall past lives as sex offenders and drug addicts, with their "liberation" sparking a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This highlights the "very-not-fictional horrors of our own freedoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The episode also ties into Rick's struggle with relationships, showing how his rampant egotism impedes his family life and ultimately destroys his relationship with Unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Bonus Reference**: A TV show watched in the episode is a recreation of "Community," Dan Harmon’s previous show, featuring Jeff Winger, who, like Rick, is an egotistical character struggling with human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## [[Atheism themes in Rick and Morty | Atheism and the Demise of Gods]]

"Raising Gazorpazorp" draws heavily on the obscure 1974 film "Zardoz" to explore [[atheism_themes_in_rick_and_morty | atheism themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

*   **References**: "Zardoz" features a giant floating head god that commands savages to kill others, only for one savage, Zed, to discover this god is a lie perpetuated by immortal aristocrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The film is known for its memorable lines like "The gun is good, the penis is evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Traditional Trope**: "Zardoz" is about a character who discovers his God is a lie and proceeds to destroy that God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **`Rick and Morty`'s Inversion**: "Raising Gazorpazorp" adapts this plot, replacing the conflict between immortals and savages with one between men and women, but retaining the "penis is evil" theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. `Rick and Morty` extends the [[atheism_themes_in_rick_and_morty | atheist theme]], constantly reminding viewers that "either there is no God, or that God isn’t all that great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Subverting Animal Rebellion and Power Corruption

The episode "Lawnmower Dog" references the 1992 film "Lawnmower Man," about a gardener turned crazy genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   **References**: Rick's experiment to make Snuffles smart enough to stop peeing on the rug accidentally leads him to subjugate humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Snuffles renames himself "Snowball," a direct reference to the pig and Leon Trotsky analogue from George Orwell’s "Animal Farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The interspecies war parallels the rebellion in "Animal Farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. "Dogworld," a concept by show co-creator Justin Roiland, also influences the episode, featuring a world run by dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Traditional Trope**: "Animal Farm" depicts rebellious animals slowly transforming into the very oppressors they fought against, symbolizing the corruption of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **`Rick and Morty`'s Inversion**: While the farm animals in "Animal Farm" rebel against exploited labor, Snuffles rebels against the "lazy life of pethood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Crucially, `Rick and Morty` averts the typical dystopian outcome seen in "Animal Farm." With the help of an "Inception"-style intervention, Snowball realizes he is becoming everything he hated about humanity, leading him to choose a path of peace rather than corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## [[Satire and Social Commentary in Rick and Morty | Deconstructing Fantasy and Horror]]

`Rick and Morty` consistently uses [[satire and social_commentary_in_rick_and_morty | humor]] and [[satire and social_commentary_in_rick_and_morty | satire]] to strip fantasy and horror of their magic, subjecting them to the "mundanity of everyday life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | disillusionment]] is central to the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Fairy Tale Realism

*   **References**: In "Meeseeks and Destroy," Morty embarks on a cliche fairy tale adventure inspired by "Jack and the Beanstalk," aiming to help a poor village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Traditional Trope**: Fairy tales often end with "happily ever after" for protagonists who commit questionable acts without consequence, like Jack robbing and killing a giant unprovoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **`Rick and Morty`'s Inversion**: The show "normalizes" the fairy tale by introducing realism often omitted from children's stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Instead of a happy ending, Morty is put on trial for murder and confronts the giant’s emotionally devastated widow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Furthermore, the village’s king is revealed to be a sexual predator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Normalizing Horror Villains

*   **References**: The episode features Scary Terry, a legally distinct version of Freddy Krueger from "A Nightmare on Elm Street," who can murder people in their dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Traditional Trope**: Horror villains are typically portrayed as terrifying, almost supernatural entities that evoke pure fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **`Rick and Morty`'s Inversion**: `Rick and Morty` "dispels the horror" of Scary Terry by revealing his "utterly banal" and "shitty home life," and that he's scared of "the same lame dreams" as everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This [[satire_of_superhero_movies_in_rick_and_morty | trivializes]] the horror, showing the mundane reality behind the monstrous facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### The Mundane Body

*   **References**: "Anatomy Park" references both "Jurassic Park" and "Fantastic Voyage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Traditional Trope**: Movies like "Fantastic Voyage" often portray the human body as a "wonder of the natural world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **`Rick and Morty`'s Inversion**: The show presents the human body as "just a gonorrhea infested nightmare," drastically contrasting the usual romanticized depiction with a gross, realistic, and unappealing view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Overall, `Rick and Morty`'s inversion of tropes and cliches serves to deconstruct mysticism with science and subject fantasies to the mundane realities of everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This consistent "trivialization" applies not only to fairy tales but also to concepts like family, love, and even life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

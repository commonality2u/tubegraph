The animated series [[Rick and Morty episode analysis | *Rick and Morty*]] frequently inverts common cliches and tropes from various genres, including [[scifi_horror_and_fantasy_themes_in_rick_and_morty | sci-fi, horror, and fantasy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This approach allows the show to offer thought-provoking and insightful critiques of familiar narratives, contributing to its reputation as a "smartest show on television" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Demystifying the "Deal with the Devil"
In "Something Ricked This Way Comes," the show addresses the classic "deal with the devil" trope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   **Traditional Trope**: Stories involving deals with the devil typically highlight hidden consequences that arise from selfish desires or attempts to subvert the natural order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This often implies that something "too good to be true" is a warning against defying divine rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Episode References**:
    *   The episode title is a nod to Ray Bradbury's "Something Wicked This Way Comes," a novel about a magical carnival with a sinister catch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   The Devil's shop, "Needful Things," is named after Stephen King's novel where people are tricked into buying worthless items for a low cost in exchange for orchestrating pranks that lead to civil unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Rick and Morty's Inversion**:
    *   In the show, the Devil's shop offers free items, but each item creatively ruins the desired benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For instance, Rick's magic microscope makes him too stupid to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   Instead of reinforcing the moral lesson, Rick's scientific prowess allows characters to achieve their desires without mystical repercussions or debilitating curses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Science demystifies religious concepts, exposing magic as either trickery or statistical coincidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Rick renders the Devil obsolete, turning the "deal with the devil" into a "paranoid fairy tale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **New Perspective on Fear**: The episode suggests that while traditional evil and karmic retribution might be calming due to the expectation of cosmic justice, a world without such order, governed by "pure, disinterested science," is truly terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Re-evaluating Conformity in "Auto Erotic Assimilation"
The episode "Auto Erotic Assimilation" satirizes fears of conformity and critiques societal values by introducing Rick's ex-girlfriend, Unity, a hivemind collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

*   **Classic Trope**: The episode references the 1956 film "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," which depicted aliens replacing humans with emotionless replicas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This film was widely interpreted as a commentary on the Cold War threat of Communism and the suppression of individualism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Rick and Morty's Inversion**:
    *   Instead of lamenting the loss of individualism, *Rick and Morty* suggests that the freedom associated with individualism can "kind of suck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   The show highlights "the very-not-fictional horrors of our own freedoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. For example, Unity's assimilated subjects were formerly sex offenders and drug addicts, and their "liberation" leads to a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   This inversion explores the tension between individual freedom and collective existence, linking it to Rick's character development and his struggle with relationships due to his rampant egotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Meta-Reference**: The show also includes a bonus reference to Dan Harmon's previous show, *Community*, suggesting thematic similarities between Rick and *Community*'s protagonist, Jeff Winger, both egotistical characters grappling with human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Atheism and Authority in "Raising Gazorpazorp"
"Raising Gazorpazorp" draws heavily from the obscure 1974 film *Zardoz*, which features a giant floating head commanding "chosen savages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

*   **Classic Trope**: *Zardoz* features a protagonist who discovers his "god" is a lie, leading him to destroy that false deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Rick and Morty's Inversion**: *Rick and Morty* uses this framework to reinforce a recurring theme of atheism, suggesting that either there is no God, or if there is, "God isnâ€™t all that great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The show takes the film's conflict between immortals and savages and reinterprets it as a gender-based conflict, all precipitated by Morty's desire for a sex doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Animal Rebellion and Class Struggle in "Lawnmower Dog"
"Lawnmower Dog" takes inspiration from "Lawnmower Man" and "Animal Farm" to explore themes of rebellion and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   **Primary Reference**: The title "Lawnmower Dog" references the 1992 film "Lawnmower Man," where a gardener gains genius-level intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Rick and Morty's Inversion**: Rick makes the family dog, Snuffles, intelligent enough to cease house-training issues, but accidentally so intelligent that he subjugates the human race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Secondary Reference**: Snuffles rejects his "slave name" for "Snowball," a direct reference to the pig and Leon Trotsky analogue from George Orwell's *Animal Farm* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Trope Inversion**: While *Animal Farm* depicts animals rebelling against human exploitation of their labor, Snuffles' rebellion is against the "lazy life of pethood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Thematic Twist**: In *Animal Farm*, the rebellious animals gradually transform into their former oppressors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. In *Rick and Morty*, a dystopian outcome is averted when Snowball realizes he is becoming what he hated about humanity, leading to the dogs leaving to populate a new dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Normalizing Fantasy and Horror
A central element of [[rick_and_morty_story_structure | *Rick and Morty*'s story structure]] is the "disillusionment" it fosters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The show frequently "demystifies religion with hard science" and "deconstructs fantasies by subjecting them to the mundanity of everyday life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

*   **"Meeseeks and Destroy" (Fairy Tales)**:
    *   Morty embarks on a cliche fairytale adventure inspired by "Jack and the Beanstalk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
    *   **Trope**: Traditional fairy tales end "happily ever after" with heroes facing no consequences for their actions, such as robbing and killing a giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   **Rick and Morty's Inversion**: The show "normalizes" the fairy tale by introducing realism. Morty is put on trial for murder and confronted by the giant's grieving widow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Furthermore, the village king is revealed to be a sexual predator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Scary Terry (Horror Villains)**:
    *   The character Scary Terry is a parody of Freddy Krueger from "A Nightmare on Elm Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   **Trope**: Horror villains like Freddy Krueger are terrifying figures of nightmare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
    *   **Rick and Morty's Inversion**: Scary Terry's life is "utterly banal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The show dispels his horror by giving him the same "shitty home life" and "lame dreams" as anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **"Anatomy Park" (Human Body as Wonderland)**:
    *   The episode references *Jurassic Park* and *Fantastic Voyage* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
    *   **Trope**: Movies like *Fantastic Voyage* often portray the human body as a "wonder of the natural world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
    *   **Rick and Morty's Inversion**: The show depicts the human body as a "gonorrhea infested nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Overall, a primary humorous device in *Rick and Morty* is "robbing fantasy of its magic" and trivializing everything, including fairy tales, family, love, and life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

*The Lego Movie*, while seemingly a children's film and a "brandwhores" commercial, functions as a [[satire and military themes in film | satirical]] critique of the 21st-century American political, economic, and social landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## President Business: A Corporate Despot

President Business, whose name suggests both political power and corporate objectives, satirizes the influence of money over politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. His character highlights the increasingly blurred line between corporate and political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. As a corporate despot, he seeks to maintain the status quo by "gluing everyone in place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. He leverages economic control to subjugate citizens, even using a coin as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Corporate Control and Crony Capitalism

The film presents a prime example of crony capitalism, where all media, business, government, and interpersonal interactions are controlled by a single corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Octan Energy Corp

The pervasive Octan Energy Corp is a "sly reference" to real-world corporate behemoths that controlled life on Earth, such as Google Plus, Bing, and Tidal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

## Subjugation of the Proletariat

The citizens, representing the proletariat, are subdued into "silence and complacency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This is achieved through:
*   **"Taco Tuesday"**: An alluring distraction that proves "humans were powerless to resist alliteration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **"Where Are My Pants"**: A show designed to dull citizens into submission, poking fun at "mindless television" and its "cheap, short-form, internet-only facsimiles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

Despite its nature as a "glorified two-hour toy commercial," *The Lego Movie* delivers a harsh indictment of corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

*Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice* (BvS) faced the challenge of making Superman a relatable character, a difficulty given his indestructible, selfless, and god-like nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The solution chosen by the architects of the DCEU was to portray him with vulnerabilities, flaws, and doubts, akin to a benevolent messiah figure whose human aspects are emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Departing from Archetype

BvS depicts Superman engaged in a push and pull, deciding whether to be a benevolent savior or to focus solely on his personal interests, particularly Lois Lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This approach, however, fundamentally undermines the potential for a clear [[ideological_conflict_between_batman_and_superman | ideological conflict between Batman and Superman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

In contrast, Frank Miller's graphic novel *The Dark Knight Returns*, a major inspiration for the film, explicitly establishes Superman as the "anti-Rand" figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. In Miller's work, Superman's self-sacrificing moral righteousness and commitment to 'good' brand him as a "Government Stooge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This portrayal creates a compelling ideological distinction, pitting the individualism of Batman against the conformism of Superman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Superman's Muddled Philosophy in BvS

BvS attempts to make Superman more relatable by injecting elements of [[Ayn Rands philosophy in superhero narratives | Ayn Rand's philosophy]], specifically Objectivism, into his character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, this decision complicates his portrayal:

*   **Relatability vs. Archetype**: Previous iterations, such as Christopher Reeve's iconic portrayal, focused on Superman's self-sacrificing goodness, where he saves people simply because it's the right thing to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The Superman of BvS, however, appears as if he's "stuck performing the most tiresome 9-5 job imaginable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Undermining Benevolence**: The film constantly undercuts the perception of Superman as a purely benevolent Christ-like hero, implying that "Gods shouldn’t whine about saving humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Batman explicitly tells him, "You were never a god, you were never even a man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Internal Conflict**: Superman's crisis manifests as two warring identities: the classic "Superman ‘The God’" (benevolent and Christopher Reeves-like) and "Superman ‘The Man’" (a Randian Objectivist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This is exemplified when he flies to the Middle East to save Lois but leaves other innocents to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Philosophical Influences

Superman's internal struggle is influenced by key figures in his life:

*   **Martha Kent**: His mother suggests there's no difference between choosing to be a benevolent messiah or a self-involved Objectivist; both are equally valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The critical aspect, from this perspective, is that it's Clark's rational choice to make, a hallmark of a [[Ayn Rands philosophy in superhero narratives | Randian hero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Jonathan Kent**: In a dream sequence, Jonathan Kent recounts selflessly saving his farm from a flood, only to discover it inadvertently flooded another farm upstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This narrative dismantles the notion of selfless heroism, suggesting that being a "classic selfless do-gooder Superman" is pointless because there will always be uncontrollable consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Jonathan Kent's ghost acts as a "ghost of Objectivism past," implying that true moral righteousness comes from self-betterment, pursuing self-interest, and protecting loved ones, as they bring happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This is ethical egoism in a nutshell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Ambiguous Resolution

Superman ultimately doesn't make a clear choice between being a messiah or a [[Ayn Rands philosophy in superhero narratives | Randian hero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. He initially seems to embrace Jonathan's objectivism by returning to Metropolis to save Lois and Martha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, even echoing Jonathan's parting words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, moments later, he sacrifices himself in a highly Messianic, Christ-like fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. He attempts to embody both, taking responsibility for the planet as a benevolent savior while also stating he does it for Lois as an objectivist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Impact on Ideological Conflict

Superman's ambiguous philosophical stance becomes problematic because BvS is framed as an [[ideological_conflict_between_batman_and_superman | ideological conflict between Batman and Superman]], yet none truly exists due to their shared, muddled philosophical ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. While the film initially hints at their differing beliefs—Batman's distrust of a "superhuman benevolent savior" and Superman's view of Batman as a vigilante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>—it immediately upends this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

By using Objectivism to make Superman relatable, the film inadvertently creates almost no ideological difference between the two characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This results in a conflict between a clear "Randian Hero" (Batman) and a "Maybe Sort-of Randian Hero who can’t decide if he wants to be the divine savior the world wants him to be" (Superman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Ultimately, the film presents no clear preference for heroism, blurring the lines between self-sacrifice for the greater good and pursuing self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The message instead becomes a call for "MORE HEROES" to form the Justice League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, leaving the film's philosophy muddled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

*South Park* is widely associated with being "irreverent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, with critics often calling it so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This quality is particularly evident in its handling of religion, a subject typically treated with reverence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The show forces viewers to critically examine the meaning of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, raising questions that other series might avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Challenging the Sacred and Profane

*South Park* fundamentally denies the legitimacy of the distinction between the sacred and the profane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. In the world of *South Park*, ordinary things can be a "really big deal," while things that seem "mindblowingly important" can be inconsequential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For example, the boys are not "starstruck" by Jesus but fight over playing him in an Easter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, and when they meet God, Stan asks about periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The show's approach is perceived as anti-religious by some because it does not treat religion as sacred, a core tenet of Western spiritual traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Sociologist Émile Durkheim, in *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life*, argued that Western religions divide the world into the sacred and the profane, with the sacred always taken seriously due to its connection to fundamental cosmic forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. *South Park*'s satire dismantles this division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Desecrating the Sacred for Salvation

A recurring theme in *South Park* is that sometimes the only way to "save something you’ve made sacred is by desecrating it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   In "Red Hot Catholic Love" (Season 6), Father Maxie tears a "sacred Vatican Document" to defy the Queen Spider, a metaphor for the church's molestation scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The show suggests the church could only evolve if it ceased to be "too sacred to investigate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   In *South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut*, Cartman and Kenny save the world by cursing at Saddam Hussein and making a deal with the Devil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## [[critique_of_religious_manipulation_in_south_park | Critique of Religious Manipulation in South Park]]

*South Park* highlights that religion stands out as important "only when people are manipulating it for their own purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Eric Cartman is presented as the "undisputed master" of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   In Season 4, Cartman becomes a tent revival preacher to get rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   In Season 7, he finds success in Christian music by altering secular pop songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   In "The Passion of the Jew" (Season 8), he creates a fan club for Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ*, viewing it as an opportunity to lead the "Fourth Reich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   In Season 17, he paints a cow to resemble the biblically prophesied red heifer to mess with Kyle, accidentally bringing about world peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## The Myth of Redemptive Violence

[[south_parks_portrayal_of_religion | South Park's portrayal of religion]] suggests that society's concept of the sacred is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Jesus, despite literally walking the Earth, often goes unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. His public-access talk show, "Jesus and Pals," is routinely beaten in ratings by "Jimbo and Ned’s series, Huntin’ and Killin’" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. However, when Jesus fights, he suddenly becomes "their Lord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

*South Park*'s Jesus embodies the "myth of redemptive violence," a concept described by American theologian Walter Wink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This myth posits that the sense of the sacred, originating from ancient Babylonian mythology, stems from the desire to see good triumph over evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Wink argues this is "the real myth of the modern world" and the "dominant religion in our society today," surpassing Judaism, Christianity, or Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Jesus fights not because he desires to, but because he realizes his followers' projected myth is more important than his own offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Beyond Anti-Religious Sentiment

Despite being perceived as anti-religious and facing boycotts for its portrayal of Jesus and network censorship for attempts to portray Muhammad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker do not see themselves as anti-religious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Matt Stone stated, "Neither one of us is anti-religious at all. I mean I'm fascinated by religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The show suggests that once its "casual attitude towards the sacred" is understood, it is not "that hard on religion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Critiquing Self-Righteousness

A major recurring theme is that one does not need to be religious to act like a "narrow-minded assh*le" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The series often features characters who are self-righteous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   Stan's character arc in Season 16, as a self-promotional activist, exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. He enjoys being treated with reverence as a hero but moves on when his cause doesn't make him popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This contrasts with Wendy Testaburger, who has deeper motivations and self-respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   The show argues that movements led by people motivated by a desire for seriousness are likely to "go off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This applies to the New Atheism movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. In the "Go God Go" two-part episode, Cartman is trapped in the 26th century where militant atheist factions are killing each other over "branding disputes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The message conveyed is that "human beings are violent and irrational, and getting rid of religion isn't gonna change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Stone and Parker believe that religion appears ridiculous because people are ridiculous, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Embracing Ambiguity and the Inherent Ridiculousness of Life

Australian science historian Margaret Wertheim argues in *Pythagoras’ Trousers* that Western scientific models often resemble religious ones due to a "hypermasculine drive for certainty and finality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. She, like Stone and Parker, suggests that a refusal to accept ambiguity makes answers to big questions sound ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

*South Park* does not offer a definitive answer on whether to be religious or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Matt Stone posed the rhetorical question in 2011: "If the mass delusion of a religion makes you happy, makes your family work better, is that bad or good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The series has explicitly made this argument twice, in "Red Hot Catholic Love" and "All About Mormons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This view aligns with American philosopher William James, who wrote in *Pragmatism* (1907) that whether life was created by a divine figure or not, "it's still life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

Unlike most series dealing with religion that offer an "escape route" or an ideology to avoid being ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, *South Park*'s unique underlying philosophy is that "being human is inevitably ridiculous, and that there’s no way of avoiding this fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The show's core message is that "no matter which religion or life philosophy we adopt," we will look silly if we take ourselves too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The key question is not whether one's belief system is a joke, but "whether or not we know it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* explores the efficacy and application of science through the lens of alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While alchemy is used by the protagonists, Edward and Alphonse Elric, to restore their bodies, it is also depicted as being used for "awful things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Alchemy as a Scientific Endeavor
Set in Amestris, a country resembling pre-World War II Europe, the defining feature is the success of alchemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Alchemy is presented as the manipulation and altering of matter using natural energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. It is essentially treated as a science, combining chemistry and biology with its own unique laws and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The most important law of alchemy is "The Law of Equivalent Exchange," which implies that with the right materials and a transmutation circle, one can manipulate matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Critiques of Alchemy's Application
The series immediately establishes a dynamic between science (alchemy) and faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Initially, alchemy appears to triumph over faith when the Elric brothers expose Father Cornello, a religious figure in Liore, whose "miracles" are merely clever applications of alchemy used to manipulate followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

However, the show quickly complicates this view. In a shocking turn, the Sewing-Life Alchemist, Shou Tucker, reveals he used his own daughter and family dog to create a talking chimera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Tucker justifies his actions by claiming he was "only doing what science demands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This act highlights the potential for science to become amoral when pursued "at any cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, leading the series to question "the value of single-mindedly clinging to science" and the "consequences of reducing all knowledge to scientific terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This mode of thought is broadly referred to as [[philosophical_critiques_of_scientism | scientism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Scientism and Dehumanization
[[Philosophical critiques of scientism | Scientism]] is criticized for placing scientific knowledge above all other forms of knowledge and attempting to reduce other knowledge into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whose ideas are referenced, argues that science is just one explanatory framework, not always as rational or consistent as it purports to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. An unquestioning acceptance of any ideology, including science, can lead to "disastrous results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

In *Brotherhood*, this blind adherence to science results in "monsters" like man-made chimeras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Alchemy's "impersonal, dehumanizing aspect" is embodied by [[moral_implications_of_equivalent_exchange_in_alchemy | The Law of Equivalent Exchange]], which reduces objects, animals, and even people to their physical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The Elric Brothers' initial attempt to resurrect their mother by transmuting basic human ingredients exemplifies this reductionist approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The most sought-after alchemical creation, "The Philosopher's Stone," further highlights this moral dilemma. When decoded, its key ingredient is discovered to be human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Though the stone could restore their bodies, the Elrics are unwilling to use it due to its origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. In contrast, the Homunculi, artificial humans powered by these stones, exemplify [[philosophical_critiques_of_scientism | scientism]] by reducing the souls within the stones to mere alchemic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The Elrics, however, use the stone's power while respecting the "autonomy of those souls," distinguishing them as moral according to philosopher Immanuel Kant, who believed people should never be reduced to calculations but are "always a goal in themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Militarization of Science
A significant problem with alchemy is its subservience to the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. There are "three state appointed tenets of Alchemy," the first of which is "LITERALLY obey the military" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. State Alchemists are often referred to as "dogs of the military" or "human weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Sociologist Stanley Aronowitz notes that scientists often view themselves as independent, but their funding frequently comes from corporations or the state, meaning they don't truly own their discoveries or have a say in their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

This military influence distorts the basic principles of science. While alchemy is fundamentally about understanding and manipulating the natural flow of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, the military twists this principle. For instance, the destruction of a country and its population is justified by one general as "Alchemic Rebirth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

As tools of the Amestrian government, alchemists become instruments of "Father," the series' chief antagonist, who controls the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Father desires to become God and uses alchemy, military conflicts, and millions of lives to achieve his goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The "Ishbalan War of Extermination," a brutal and heartless conflict, was fought solely to further Father's plan, with state alchemists making a significant military impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The devastating force of alchemy in Ishbal is described using "sterile scientific terms," even by "good guys," sanitizing what is essentially genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The Führer King Bradley even applies [[moral_implications_of_equivalent_exchange_in_alchemy | The Law of Equivalent Exchange]] to justify refusing a ceasefire in exchange for a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

The parallels between Amestris and pre-World War II Germany are evident, from the "Führer" title to human experiments reminiscent of those conducted by Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Feyerabend, who fought as a lieutenant in World War II, witnessed firsthand the scientific arguments made by a dictatorship for war and genocide, leading him to propose a separation between science and state, with ultimate power residing in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Beyond Pure Scientism
*Fullmetal Alchemist* serves as "a cautionary tale about the blind adherence to science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. The problem with [[philosophical_critiques_of_scientism | scientism]] isn't that science is inherently bad, but that any "unreflective veneration of any ideology" inhibits free thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Blindly following science as the sole arbiter of truth is depicted as just as harmful as blindly following faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

Characters in *Brotherhood* grow by recognizing the limitations of adhering to a single ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The Elrics question the foundations of Western Alchemy when Father cancels it out, leading them to explore Alkahestry, its Eastern equivalent that uses life energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Bridging these two ideologies allows them to triumph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

Ultimately, the Elrics' "humble rejection of a single ideology" makes them special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. They constantly question alchemy and what it means to be a State Alchemist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Their core desire is to discover their "own truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>, rejecting the alchemic worldview that equates their bodies with the world's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

Edward's final act involves offering his ability to perform alchemy to restore Alphonse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. He recognizes the arrogance in believing alchemy could explain or solve everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Unlike Father, who clung to [[philosophical_critiques_of_scientism | scientism]] and couldn't understand human emotions or the autonomy of individuals, Ed understands his place in the universe beyond mere alchemical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

With their bodies restored, the Elrics continue their journey to "keep searching for truth and new methods to discover it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Alphonse travels east and Edward west, seeking to gather all knowledge to make their principle of reciprocity a reality, a concept that goes beyond the "cold formula" of [[moral_implications_of_equivalent_exchange_in_alchemy | The Law of Equivalent Exchange]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

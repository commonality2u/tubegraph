*Death Note*, an anime phenomenon, addresses a range of [[philosophical_exploration_of_justice_in_death_note | philosophical topics]], including property rights and human nature, but one of its most interesting themes is justice: what it is and how it should be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Unlike most pop culture, *Death Note* is unique not in *what* it says about justice, but in *how* it goes about saying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The series constantly challenges various definitions of justice through its unique method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, notably through the lens of ancient philosophical thought experiments and modern theories.

## The Ring of Gyges and the Role of Anonymity

The concept of anonymity and its effect on moral behavior, a central theme in *Death Note*, is largely influenced by the ancient Greek story, the Ring of Gyges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. In this fable, a shepherd finds a ring that grants him invisibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Using this power, he immediately seduces the King's wife, kills the King, and takes over the kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

In Plato's *Republic*, the character Glaucon (Plato's real-life brother) uses this story to argue that justice is merely a social contract designed to prevent people from harming each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The thought experiment suggests that people only truly value justice for its ability to make them look good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Glaucon posits that someone with an invisibility ring would naturally act like an "asshat" because morality is only valued when actions can be scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This directly resonates with *Death Note*'s portrayal of [[role_of_anonymity_and_identity_in_understanding_justice_in_death_note | anonymity]] and identity:

> "Humans always try to maintain appearances when they're in public. That's just how we are. But this is how they really feel. Most are too afraid to support me as they're worried about what others will think. Many would rather deny my existence, but on the internet, where you can remain anonymous, support for Kira is growing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>

The moment the risk of damaging one's reputation disappears, so does interest in justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Light Yagami, the "golden boy valedictorian," maintains a facade of "normal" morality while taking joy in actions far worse than breaking societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This raises a key question *Death Note* asks: "What does Justice mean when nobody's looking?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> This theme is mirrored in Light's pseudonym as Kira, L and N's namelessness, and the anonymity of Kira's supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Plato's Republic and the Method of Philosophical Inquiry

Plato's *Republic* functions as a Socratic Dialogue, meaning it's less concerned with providing a single theory of justice and more with detailing the *process* of exploring it through hypothetical scenarios and varying definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. *Death Note* employs a similar method, showing the evolution of justice theories between and within its characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Many characters, including Light, Misa, and Mikami, believe they possess true knowledge of justice, and the tension between these characters and their skeptics forms the core of the show's [[comparative_analysis_of_justice_theories_rawls_plato_and_death_note | philosophical exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. A memorable instance is when both L and Light simultaneously declare, "I am justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Light even claims to have *become* justice by reducing violent crime and ending wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

*Death Note* establishes itself as a modern Socratic Dialogue, using multiple participants to flesh out the universal question, "What is Justice?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> From the moment Light proposes his vision of a new world, the question of justice is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Ryuk, motivated by boredom, immediately notices a contradiction in Light's plan, initiating the Socratic Dialogue that continues throughout the series <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Comparative Theories of Justice: Ideal vs. Injustice

*Death Note* also implicitly contrasts different philosophical approaches to justice:

*   **Ideal Theory (Rawls & Plato):** Philosopher John Rawls, much like Light and Plato, argues that to correct societal injustices, one must first have an ideal concept of "justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This "ideal theory" suggests understanding what justice would look like in a perfect world where everyone acts correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Light and Mikami embody this approach, aiming for a perfect world achieved through a specific definition of justice, even if it means mass deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Injustice Theory (Naomi Zack):** In contrast, philosopher Naomi Zack favors "injustice theory," which doesn't rely on a pre-existing ideal of justice but instead focuses on identifying injustices as they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This approach is more practical, as it's easier to point to a case of injustice than to start with a broad definition of what is just <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. L, M, and N's hunt for Kira aligns with this, driven by the recognition that Kira's "new world" is unjust, rather than a high-minded definition of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. L's concept of justice seems to be a response to injustice, making any definition of "The Just" secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Socratic Inquisitors within Death Note

Beyond Light and L, other characters contribute to this ongoing dialogue:

*   **L as Inquisitor:** L frequently acts as an inquisitor, not unlike Socrates, by poking holes in Kira's reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Matsuda, the Modern Socrates:** Perhaps more surprisingly, Matsuda serves as a "modern Socrates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Despite being mocked, he raises sincere questions about the moral judgments of nearly everyone, including Light, Kira, L, and the police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. He challenges the Task Force's belief in Kira's inherent evilness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>:

    > "Do you guys ever think that maybe Kira isn't completely evil?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>
    > "I don't really know, but I think that Kira's trying to fight evil and change the world in his own way and well the worlds become a good place for people who live honest lives so..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>

    Matsuda's self-doubt and willingness to recognize his own ignorance—crucial for Socrates—allow him to reveal the ignorance of those around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Even as he kills Light, he does so with questions, not answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. By forcing viewers and characters to consider their own opinions of justice, Matsuda helps to organize the competing ideas into an intelligible conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

## Conclusion

*Death Note* offers no clear stance on what constitutes justice, instead employing a unique method to constantly challenge its definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The ambiguity regarding who best represented justice, or whether Light's "New World" justified his means, is what makes the show so poignant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. While it's an addicting detective procedural, *Death Note* never abandons its original question of what makes a just world, and most importantly, it never gives a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Light himself summarizes this ambiguity: "If Kira gets caught then that makes him evil. But if he wins and rules the world then I guess he's justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The show implies that the "war of competing moral codes" was a logic game, not a truth-seeking endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. *Death Note* opens more doors than it closes regarding the meaning and implications of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The real connection between the justice explored in *The Republic* and in *Death Note* lies not in their definitions, but in their shared method of philosophical inquiry, distinguishing *Death Note* as a show that *does* philosophy rather than just borrowing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

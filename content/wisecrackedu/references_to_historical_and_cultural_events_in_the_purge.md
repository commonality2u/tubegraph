The film *The Purge* incorporates various references to historical and cultural events, drawing parallels between its fictional society and real-world phenomena.

## Societal State and Modern Culture
The setting of *The Purge* in the 21st century Earth is depicted as a time when conditions deteriorated due to elements like Doritos Tacos and Snapchat, leading the government to legalize murder for a limited period annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This implies a critique of modern consumerism and social media's perceived role in societal decay.

## Philosophical and Cultural References
The film subtly alludes to philosophical concepts and cultural figures:
*   **Thomas Petty's Philosophy** The Sandins' eventual refusal to harm the injured man is linked to the philosophy of musician Thomas Petty, suggesting a moral awakening or adherence to principles against such actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Mrs. Sandin is later described as "riding the Tom Petty wave pretty hard" when she refuses to kill the neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Light and Dark Duality** The film explores the human psyche's "light side and a dark side," comparing it to the Jedi hobbits from *Star Track* (a reference to Star Wars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This duality is visually represented by images like white and blue bouquets and Charlie's "half charred nightmare machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## [[ritualistic_and_cultural_comparisons_of_the_purge | Ritualistic and Cultural Comparisons]]
The date and rituals surrounding the Purge draw parallels to historical and religious events:
*   **Vernal Equinox** March 21, the date of the Purge, frequently coincides with Earth's vernal equinox, when day and night are of equal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This date, historically associated with rebirth and renewal, mirrors the Purge's stated intention to foster a healthier, more balanced society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Christian Easter and Resurrection** The vernal equinox was historically used to calibrate the date for Christian Easter, celebrating the resurrection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Similarly, citizens in the film celebrate the "resurrection of their society" on "Purge-mas Eve" with "almost religious fervor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The "blue baptisias" displayed reference the Christian ritual of baptism, also known as the "dunkeroo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Socioeconomic and Political Commentary
The film's depiction of the Purge's impact is tied to real-world social issues:
*   **Social Stratification and the War on Drugs** *The Purge* serves as a [[philosophy_and_socioeconomic_commentary_in_the_purge | philosophical and socioeconomic commentary]], highlighting issues of [[class_struggles_and_economic_disparities_highlighted_by_the_purge | social stratification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Although the Purge laws are presented as class and race neutral, they disproportionately affect the disenfranchised who cannot afford protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This imbalance echoes the 1980s War on Drugs, where laws for crack cocaine (associated with poor Black communities) were significantly harsher than those for powder cocaine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Elite Privilege** The film's antagonists, dressed in "prep school attire," are presented as wealthy elites who treat hunting the homeless as an "extracurricular for their college apps," showcasing [[the_role_of_wealth_and_power_dynamics_in_the_purge | the role of wealth and power dynamics]] and the [[dehumanization_and_disposability_as_presented_in_the_purge | dehumanization]] of the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Critique of Violence as Entertainment
The film itself engages in a [[critique_of_the_purge_as_a_violent_entertainment | critique of violent entertainment]]:
*   **Desensitization to Violence** *The Purge* initially suggests violence can relieve aggression, but quickly contradicts this by showing that it only desensitizes people and begets more violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Brutal images are juxtaposed with classical music to underscore how violence has ceased to shock and has become mundane entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Normalizing Grotesque Events** In the Purge-world, humans watch grotesque events on TV for entertainment, akin to watching New Year's Eve celebrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The film functions as a self-criticism, as it offers viewers a "good old-fashioned bloodbath" for aggression release, perpetuating the cycle it critiques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

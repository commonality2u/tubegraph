The 2016 film *[[analysis_of_suicide_squad_movie | Suicide Squad]]* is presented as a unique disaster in filmmaking, having undergone significant changes after its trailer was deemed superior to the original cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Despite its flawed execution and [[criticisms_of_suicide_squads_execution | criticisms]], the film is considered ambitious, offering an opportunity to analyze what can be learned from media that "doesn't quite work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Control as the Primary Theme

A hallmark of a thought-provoking movie is its ability to introduce and develop a theme, inspiring thought or feeling for the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While films like *The Dark Knight* explore [[chaos_versus_order_in_the_dark_knight | Order vs. Chaos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, *Suicide Squad*'s primary theme is control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This theme manifests in numerous ways throughout the film:

*   **Abuse of Prisoners**: Guards exert control and abuse the main characters, who are powerless prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Squad's Devices**: Amanda Waller and Rick Flag control the Squad through devices that kill them if they disobey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Enchantress's Possession**: The Enchantress struggles for control over archaeologist June Moon's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Waller's Control over Enchantress**: Amanda Waller controls the Enchantress by threatening her heart if she doesn't comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Waller's Control over Flag**: Waller exploits Rick Flag's love for June Moon to control him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Enchantress's Slave Monsters**: The Enchantress controls people by transforming them into slave monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Diablo's Loss of Control**: Diablo accidentally kills his family after losing control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | Joker]] and Harley Quinn**: The [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | Joker]] controls Harley Quinn through their abusive relationship, symbolized by her jacket reading "Property of The Joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Control in the Snyder DC Universe

The theme of control is not isolated to *Suicide Squad*, but is seen throughout the Snyder [[thematic_discussions_in_dc_universe_films | DC Universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

*   **Man of Steel**: Questions how mankind can maintain control when metahumans with godlike powers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The implied answer is that a benevolent savior will preserve law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Batman v Superman**: Explores the ramifications if a benevolent savior, like Superman, were to turn hostile, questioning how mankind would maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

*Suicide Squad* enters this narrative following Superman's death, asking how far humanity must go to maintain control now that Earth's "metahuman bodyguard" is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. While *Batman v Superman* explored god-like beings wielding power over humanity, *Suicide Squad* aims to explore the ramifications of humans wielding overwhelming power to fight godlike beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This dynamic is further highlighted by comparing Amanda Waller to both God and the Devil, echoing Lex Luthor's painting in *Batman v Superman* about Satan's fall from an angel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This comparison poses the question: Will Waller's quest for control, despite being a righteous official, go too far and lead to her fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>?

## Missed Thematic Opportunities

The film sets up a "pretty cool thematic setup" ripe for "juicy moral conundrums" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, such as whether tyrannical control is necessary to combat existential threats (like in *The Dark Knight*) or if oppression is inherently evil regardless of justification (like in *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

However, the film fails to develop this moral gray area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Instead of portraying the Enchantress as a victim of control, offering thematic interplay and questioning identification with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, the film reverts to a "lamest of superhero movie tropes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>: making Enchantress a "bland, evil villain" with a vague motivation to destroy the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

This choice ultimately "robs the themes of control and oppression of any meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The film neither suggests that oppressive power is necessary (as the Squad kills Enchantress of their own accord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>), nor that it is evil (as Waller essentially wins and her corrupt status quo is reinstated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>). Those under the control of others, including Enchantress, Diablo, the Squad, and Harley Quinn, largely remain subjugated or suffer negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The film ends up being a "mess," portraying subjugated people defending their own imprisonment against another victim of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | The Joker]]'s Underexplored Contribution

A significant criticism of *Suicide Squad* is that Jared Leto's [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | Joker]] serves no purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. However, his line, "Desire becomes surrender, surrender becomes power," hints at a thematic contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

This concept is briefly explored when Enchantress attempts to seduce the Squad by showing them their desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. By desiring these visions, they would want to surrender, granting Enchantress power over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Despite this, the final cut of the film fails to meaningfully develop how desire, surrender, and power relate to the overall theme of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Harley Quinn's arc, which initially shows her submitting to desire by letting the [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | Joker]] dominate her, ultimately sees her rejecting Enchantress's dominance at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. However, this is not a transformative lesson for Harley, as she quickly returns to the [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | Joker]]'s control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Thus, even the [[role_of_the_joker_in_suicide_squad | Joker]]'s insight fails to meaningfully develop the film's core theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Media Autopsy
> The analysis of *Suicide Squad* serves as a "media autopsy" or a "Wisecrack version of a participation trophy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, breaking down media that doesn't quite work to learn from it.

In conclusion, *Suicide Squad* possesses a "spark of intelligence," suggesting earlier, more insightful versions of the film likely existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. However, the finished product ultimately threw "all nuance out the window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, leading to a shallow exploration of its central theme of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

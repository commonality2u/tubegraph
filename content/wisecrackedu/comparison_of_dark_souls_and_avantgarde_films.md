The *Dark Souls* series, known for its challenging gameplay and cryptic storyline, presents a narrative that can be "impossibly baffling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Namco even offered $10,000 for an explanation of the story, with many attempts only leading to more frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, this lack of conventional plot clarity may be intentional, similar to methods used by avant-garde filmmakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Intentional Ambiguity: A Shared Approach

A story that "deliberately leads nowhere" might seem unusual for a video game, but it is not uncommon in cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Pioneering Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni consistently employed this technique in his works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Michelangelo Antonioni's Influence

Antonioni's films often feature plots that serve as distractions from their true focus:
*   **"Blow Up"**: This film seduces the audience with a murder mystery, but intentionally leaves the killer and motive unresolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The plot's ambiguity allows the film to function as a character study about a narcissistic artist plagued by ennui <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **"La Aventura"**: Similarly, this film centers on a woman who disappears during a boating trip, but her fate is never revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Instead, the film explores the "hollow decadence" of her spoiled friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This approach of deliberate non-narrative, or using plot as a distraction, is a key parallel between Antonioni's films and *Dark Souls*.

## Hidetaka Miyazaki and [[Visual symbolism in Dark Souls | Visual Storytelling]]

The enigmatic video game maestro Hidetaka Miyazaki, director of *Dark Souls*, shares a similar artistic philosophy with Antonioni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Just as Antonioni created meaning through character, Miyazaki creates meaning in *Dark Souls* through [[Visual symbolism in Dark Souls | visual design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Examples of Visual Meaning

*   In the beginning of *Dark Souls 2*, an old lady is seen spinning yarn at a sewing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. While her dialogue may be unclear, the visuals reference the Norns of Norse mythology, who spin the "yarns of fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This immediately introduces themes of destiny and predestination through [[Film analysis and symbolism | visual symbolism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Though dialogue is sparse, it often echoes the game's [[Philosophical themes in Dark Souls | thematic core]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The game seems to revolve around "piecing together a broken past and figuring out who we are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This emphasis on [[Identity and desire in Dark Souls | identity]] and the unconscious further highlights the game's reliance on broader themes rather than explicit narrative details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

By focusing on [[Visual symbolism in Dark Souls | visual design]] and underlying [[Philosophical themes in Dark Souls | philosophical themes]], *Dark Souls* aligns with the techniques of avant-garde films that prioritize deeper meaning over a straightforward, easily deciphered plot.

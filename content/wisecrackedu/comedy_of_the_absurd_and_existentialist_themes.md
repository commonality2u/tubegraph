Comedy of the Absurd is a form of existential-based humor that focuses on the fallout encountered when facing a world devoid of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. Instead of succumbing to despair, this type of comedy takes the opposite approach, highlighting the broad humor in humanity's tragic insignificance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. This tragic absurdity is a core element of Monty Python's comedic style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

## Key Characteristics
Comedies of the absurd derive their humor from the discrepancy between reality and people's beliefs, or between what is true and what is perceived as true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Characters in these narratives often find themselves in hopeless situations, compelled to engage in repetitive and ultimately futile actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

## Examples in Media

### Monty Python
The film *Monty Python's Life of Brian* exemplifies the comedy of the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Brian's entire life is a series of absurd misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. He is born in a stable next to Jesus, leading the Three Wise Men to mistakenly believe he is the Messiah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. This projection of significance onto the insignificant is a hallmark of [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | existential thought]], particularly the philosophy of [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Albert Camus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Camus]] rejected the desperate search for meaning and instead embraced "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

Further examples from *Life of Brian* include:
*   Brian's disciples mistakenly believing he has risen to heaven when he simply runs away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   Disciples proclaiming a lost sandal as a sign of Brian's divinity, attributing significance to an ordinary object due to their desire for meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.
*   Brian's futile attempts to convince his disciples that he is not the Messiah, only for them to interpret his denials as further proof of his divinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

Despite his tragic impending crucifixion, Brian finds comfort in his fellow crucifixion victims, who break into the song "The Bright Side of Life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. This cheerful lament mirrors the Myth of Sisyphus, where Sisyphus is condemned to an eternal, repetitive, and fruitless task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. [[albert_camus_absurdism_and_its_reflections_in_bojack_horseman | Albert Camus]] famously applied this Greek myth to life itself, suggesting that the key is not to let meaninglessness cause despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. When confronted with insignificance and impending doom, the only real option, though it may seem completely absurd, is laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

### Rick and Morty
The show *[[nihilism_and_existential_themes_in_rick_and_morty | Rick and Morty]]* often ties its absurd humor with thought-provoking insights into the meaninglessness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. In the "Get Schwifty" episode, massive alien heads appear on Earth, leading many people to worship them as Gods and form a cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. In reality, these "Gods" are simply an alien race seeking Earth's participation in a reality show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. This scenario demonstrates the misappropriation of meaning, where characters mistake alien reality TV enthusiasts for divine beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

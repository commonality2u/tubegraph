[[Quentin Tarantinos love for cinema | Quentin Tarantino's]] profound love for cinema is evident throughout his work, with films often functioning as homages to various genres like spaghetti westerns, kung fu, and blaxploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While his movies implicitly celebrate the medium, his most significant statement on the power of film is found in *Inglourious Basterds* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Film as a Central Theme and Weapon
The climactic events of *Inglourious Basterds* are centered around a film screening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The film is deeply meta-cinematic, meaning it is a film about film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The entire plot revolves not just around the *Nation's Pride* premiere but the broader German film culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Historical Context and Inversion
Historically, the Nazi party, particularly Joseph Goebbels, heavily exploited the power of cinema for propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Films like Riefenstahl's *Triumph of the Will* showcased the disturbing ability of cinema to deify Hitler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. [[Nazi propaganda and cinema | This Nazi propaganda machine]] contributed to modern filmmaking but also demonstrated the danger of its power in the wrong hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

In *Inglourious Basterds*, Tarantino suggests that just as cinema helped build up the Nazis, it can also tear them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. By creating a film that relishes in the highly stylized murder of the Nazi regime, Tarantino wields the same power once held by Goebbels, but with the opposite message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### The Power of the Camera
The film goes to great lengths to establish that, in its universe, the camera is more powerful than the sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The Bastards' contact in Germany is a British agent chosen specifically for his cinema expertise, emphasizing that understanding film is more crucial than traditional spycraft for the war being fought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

The Germans' adoration of film leaves them vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Film culture becomes akin to an "exhaust port on the Nazi death star" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. During the film's climax, Shosanna's lover, Marcel, sets a pile of 35mm film on fire, consuming the cinema and destroying the Nazi high command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This implies that cinema itself killed the Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Furthermore, when Shosanna kills Zoller in the projection room, it inverts his heroism from the propaganda film *Nation's Pride* where he snipes enemies from a bell tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. In the cinema, Zoller is still high up in the projection booth, separated from the battle, but becomes the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. In this version of World War II, it's not tanks, snipers, or bombers that end the war, but a cinema owner, Jewish guerrilla soldiers, and film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Tarantino's Masterpiece and Thesis
The film concludes with Lieutenant Aldo Raine's iconic line, "I think this just might be my masterpiece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This line isn't just about Raine's actions; it serves as Tarantino's mouthpiece, proclaiming the movie itself as his masterpiece and a testament to the power of cinema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Tarantino himself stated that "all that happens in Inglourious Basterds is because of the cinema, and it's not a metaphor. The 35 millimeter cinema killed the Third Reich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

While *Inglourious Basterds* is alternate history, the broader point is that cinema didn't storm Normandy, but it "won the war in people's minds" and kept it won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Post-war, cinema served to cement anti-Nazism as the norm for American culture, which was widely exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Nazis have consistently remained symbols of evil in various films, from *Indiana Jones* to *Captain America* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Tarantino suggests that 35mm film and the medium of cinema acted as the "cultural safeguard that killed the echoes of Nazism and kept them dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## The Fading Power of Cinema
However, the film raises a crucial question about whether this assertion still holds true today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. In recent years, there has been a rise in xenophobic, neo-fascist political groups and an increase in anti-Semitic and racist violence, along with Nazi-esque content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This suggests that Tarantino's theory about 35mm cinema permanently defeating Nazism might not hold up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Cinema as Ritual
Tarantino's film primarily concerns the power of movies and the act of going to the theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Watching movies in a theater is a communal activity that becomes a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Rituals, defined as activities that distinguish one moment from mundane time, like buying a ticket, finding a seat, and watching the movie, lend a greater air of importance to the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For Tarantino, this is especially true with film, as he shoots his movies on film, argues against digital projection, and only shows film at his own theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The added elements of film—the projector sound, changing reels, the projectionist—supercharge this ritual, enabling stories to have a lasting impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### The Impact of the Internet and "Robotism"
Unfortunately, this traditional cinematic experience is diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Movies can now be consumed at home, lacking the communal ritual of the theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This leads to movies resonating less and allows individuals to curate hyper-tailored cultural experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The source of this change is largely the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

Media theorist Marshall McLuhan, in *The Global Village*, predicted "global media networking" and the "death of monoculture," where everyone does their own thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He termed this setup "robotism" or right hemisphere thinking—a capacity to be a conscious presence in many places at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. McLuhan contrasted this with "left hemisphere thinking," associated with hierarchical reasoning and shared culture, like the shared ideal that Nazis are bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Right-brain thinking, or robotism, rejects these shared ideas, leading to individuals developing their own systems of belief and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

This loss of shared culture means society is losing its "ruling center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. McLuhan compares culture to an electrical circuit where each point is as central as the next, causing hierarchies to dissolve and reform constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. There is no longer a fixed ethical center, with people deriving their ethics from various digital sources like Facebook, Twitter, or 4chan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This prevents a shared agreement on rules and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Tarantino's Adaptation in a Fracturing Culture
The decline of cinema's influence means that the "ruling center" it once appealed to no longer holds the same sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Where cinema once relayed critical social messages and cemented societal ideals, the rise of "robotism" has diminished its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

Despite his traditionalist stance on film, Tarantino is adapting. He released *The Hateful Eight* as a four-part mini-series on Netflix, a move that would have been unthinkable for him just a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This shows his effort to keep his voice relevant in the evolving cultural landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. However, his next film is set in 1969, a time when cinema was a central cultural ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This raises questions about whether it will be nostalgia, an opportunity for more film references, or an acknowledgment that film's power may have changed from what he once believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

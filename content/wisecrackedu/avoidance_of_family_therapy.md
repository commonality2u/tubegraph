The episode "Pickle Rick" from *Rick and Morty* prominently features the theme of avoiding [[the_concept_of_family_in_bojack_horseman | family]] therapy and addressing emotional issues, primarily through the actions of Rick Sanchez and his daughter, Beth.

## Rick's Extreme Avoidance

Rick's primary motivation for transforming himself into a pickle is to [[distraction_as_a_coping_mechanism_in_bojack_horseman | avoid]] attending [[the_concept_of_family_in_bojack_horseman | family]] therapy [00:00:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, [00:00:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>). This act is a deliberate effort to run away from reality and emotional vulnerability [00:01:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>). As a seemingly helpless, armless pickle, Rick attempts to create the appearance that he cannot attend therapy, thereby relinquishing responsibility [00:05:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>).

This isn't the first instance of Rick's avoidance; in a previous episode, he was willing to remain in a Mad Max-esque land to avoid his daughter's divorce [00:01:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>).

## Beth's Parallel Avoidance

A clever parallel is drawn between Rick and Beth's behavior in the episode [00:00:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>). Just as Rick goes to extreme lengths to avoid baring his emotions, Beth actively stonewalls her school-appointed therapist, Dr. Wong, and maintains emotional distance [00:00:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>).

> "I think it's possible that you and your father have a very, uh, specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage and is infecting your kids with the tendency to misdirect their feelings." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

The emotional distance and avoidance of vulnerability displayed by both Rick and Beth are shown to have detrimental effects on their [[the_concept_of_family_in_bojack_horseman | family]], particularly their children Morty and Summer, who appear increasingly damaged by their parents' divorce [00:01:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>).

## Philosophical Underpinnings of Avoidance

The episode delves into philosophical concepts, particularly through Dr. Wong's insights, to explain Rick's avoidance:

### The Illusion of Control and Radical Freedom
Dr. Wong highlights Rick's inability to grasp that his mind is within his control, even though he believes he can do anything, including turning himself into a pickle [00:02:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, [00:02:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>). This ties into Jean-Paul Sartre's existential philosophy, where godlessness implies radical freedom to define one's own existence [00:02:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>).

### "Bad Faith" and Denying Choice
Sartre's concept of "bad faith" describes situations where individuals choose to act based on social pressures or perceived obligations, or pretend not to have a choice [00:03:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, [00:03:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>). Rick's transformation into a pickle is an act of "bad faith" because he blatantly disregards his choice to attend therapy [00:05:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>).

### Infinitude vs. Finitude
Unlike Sartre's concept of "finitude"—a fixed amount of choices in mortal lives where each choice precludes others—Rick deals with "infinitude" due to his access to infinite timelines [00:03:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, [00:03:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>). Rick believes his access to infinite realities allows him to avoid responsibility for his choices, as he assumes he has already made all possible choices across infinite versions of himself [00:04:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>). He tells Morty to "don't think about it!" when contemplating alternate realities where, for example, "Hitler cured cancer" [00:05:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>).

### Intelligence as Justification for Sickness
Dr. Wong critiques Rick's use of his god-like intelligence and the multiverse as a justification for his actions, stating that intelligence cannot replace the necessity of making decisions and taking responsibility [00:04:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, [00:04:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>).

> "The only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family, is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

Despite being the "master of his universe," Rick paradoxically struggles to come to terms with his own unique choices [00:04:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>). The "Pickle Rick" episode thus highlights how the avoidance of [[the_concept_of_family_in_bojack_horseman | family]] therapy and emotional responsibility can be a complex manifestation of deeper philosophical struggles with choice and agency.

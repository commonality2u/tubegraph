The film *Frozen*, which won an Academy Award [00:00:15], centers on Princess Elsa, who possesses "unexplained mutant ice powers" [00:00:23]. After inadvertently giving her younger sister, Anna, "brain-freeze" [00:00:26], Elsa isolates herself in her room for a decade [00:00:39]. Following the death of their parents [00:00:46], Elsa becomes queen [00:00:50]. When Anna wishes to marry Prince Hans after two conversations [00:00:59], Elsa refuses, prompting Elsa to run away and cast the land in eternal winter [00:01:12][00:01:16]. Anna's heart later becomes frozen, requiring an "act of true love" to thaw it [00:01:48][00:01:55]. Hans is revealed to be the villain [00:02:13], but Anna's act of true love for Elsa [00:02:29] allows Elsa to realize "the power of love" and reverse the winter [00:02:38][00:02:43].

## [[themes_and_symbolism_in_disneys_frozen | Themes and Symbolism in Frozen]]

The film is presented as a "song of ice and fire" [00:02:54], exploring the dueling properties of these elements [00:02:49].

### Ice and Fire Duality

*   **Anna (Fire)**: Associated with warmth and passion [00:02:59]. She has fiery red hair and freckles [00:03:02], and uses fire as a weapon [00:03:10]. When Hans reveals his true intentions, he extinguishes a fire, symbolizing the extinguishing of Anna's passion for him [00:03:13][00:03:17].
*   **Elsa (Ice)**: Associated with coldness and rationality [00:03:21]. She believes the answer to life is to inhibit her feelings [00:03:26][00:03:29] and isolates herself [00:03:35]. Her transformation into a "revealing, skin-tight, transparent dress" [00:03:38] suggests liberation, possibly sexual liberation [00:03:43]. However, true fulfillment and happiness for Elsa come from embracing the love of her sister and social solidarity [00:03:47][00:03:52].

### Independence vs. Connection

*   The film suggests that independence is a mistake, aligning with a "mob mentality" [00:03:59]. It portrays solitary individuals as incomplete and in need of "fixing," emphasizing that "All people require connection" [00:04:04]. The medical staff reiterates this idea, stating, "We need each other to fix us up and round us out" [00:04:12][00:04:16].

### [[critique_of_disneys_portrayal_of_relationships | Progressive Portrayal of Love]]

*   *Frozen* is considered progressive because the heroes' redemption comes from sisterly love, rather than the traditional charming prince [00:04:22][00:04:28].
*   The adage of "love at first sight," exemplified by Anna's initial courtship with Prince Hans [00:04:31][00:04:35], is shown to be trivial and misguided [00:04:35].
*   Even with a promising suitor like Kristoff, there is no definitive wedding, indicating a slow, deliberate courtship [00:04:38][00:04:44].

## [[symbolism_of_doors_in_frozen | Symbolism of Doors]]

Doors are a recurring motif throughout the film [00:04:49].

*   The film begins with the kingdom having "closed gates" [00:04:54].
*   A significant door separates the sisters during their childhood [00:04:58].
*   Elsa declares her intention to "Turn away and slam the door!" [00:05:03][00:05:07].
*   Anna later pleads with Elsa not to slam the door [00:05:11][00:05:13].
*   One of the final lines of the film, "I like the open gates. Weâ€™re never closing them again" [00:05:15][00:05:20][00:05:22], implies that Elsa will no longer shut her sister out, but also that the kingdom will be "forever susceptible to attack" [00:05:23][00:05:27].

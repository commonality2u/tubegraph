According to showrunners Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, renowned for their mastery of story structure in *Rick & Morty*, every story, from a complex epic to a simple joke, adheres to fundamental principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. However, the application of these principles differs significantly between films and television shows, primarily due to their contrasting goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Dan Harmon's "Story Embryo" (Film Focus)

Dan Harmon outlines an "8 simple steps" structure, which he calls "the story embryo," that is typically applied to film narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This structure describes a journey of change and transformation for the protagonist:

1.  A character is in a zone of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  But they want something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  They enter an unfamiliar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  Adapt to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
5.  Get what they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
6.  Pay a heavy price for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
7.  Then return to their familiar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
8.  Having changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The primary goal of a movie is to provide viewers with a fulfilling, conclusive experience, where the hero undergoes a meaningful transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Examples like Batman in *The Dark Knight Rises* saving Gotham and starting a new life illustrate this definitive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Television's Distinctive Approach

In contrast to films, television aims to keep audiences watching indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This objective shifts the focus from character change to the preservation of the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Harmon suggests that TV's structure is designed to put the brain in a "vegetative state" for commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Instead of deep, transformative change, television storytelling "swaps out any meaningful and therefore potentially television-subverting truth with the basic, eternal 'truth' that change is unnecessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. For instance, in *Batman: The Animated Series*, Batman consistently fights new villains in the "same old Gotham" each episode, returning to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### TV Episode Structure

Given this aim, the structure of a TV episode often modifies Harmon's "story embryo" as follows:

1.  "I (the protagonist)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
2.  "Notice a small problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
3.  "And make a major decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
4.  "This changes things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
5.  "To some satisfaction, but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
6.  "There are consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
7.  "That must be undone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
8.  "And I must admit the futility of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## *Rick & Morty*: A Case Study in TV Structure

*Rick & Morty* exemplifies this television structure, consistently following this format despite its outlandish scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The episode "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" (Season 2, Episode 6) provides a clear illustration:

*   **Step 1: Zone of Comfort**
    The episode immediately establishes the protagonists, Rick, Morty, and Summer, in a relatable situation, exiting a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Step 2: Small Problem, Need Established**
    Rick's spaceship fails to start due to a dead "Microverse Battery," setting up the central problem and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Morty's reluctance helps the audience identify with the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Major Decision, Unfamiliar Situation**
    Rick decides they must enter the Microverse inside the car battery, a literal and figurative descent into the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The show emphasizes the "noticeable contrast" between worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Step 4: Adapt, Things Change (Externally)**
    Upon arrival, Rick and Morty adapt to the Microverse, identifying the problem: Zeep Xanflorp, a scientist similar to Rick who has created his own Microverse, making Rick's battery unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Unlike film, this stage is about external changes and conflicts, not internal character development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Rick's hypocrisy is highlighted, leading to a new conflict to find a scientist within Zeep's Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Step 5: Get What They Wanted**
    Rick finds Kyle, a scientist in Zeep's Microverse who is creating his own Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This discovery leads to an "Inception-like" realization for Zeep, triggering an existential rage and a confrontation with Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Step 6: Pay a Heavy Price, Consequences**
    Rick gets what he wanted, but Kyle's existential meltdown traps them all in the "Tinyverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Rick and Zeep's inability to put aside their egos leads to an "all out war," forgetting their predicament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This stage prepares the hero for their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Step 7: Undoing Damage, Returning Home**
    Morty, with his "Tree People" tribe, forces Rick and Zeep to collaborate to escape Kyle's Tinyverse and the larger Microverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Zeep, acting as a "shadow" figure representing Rick's undesirable traits, becomes the final obstacle preventing their return and the change (fixing the battery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The fight between Rick and Zeep is symbolically "Rick fighting Rick," emphasizing his lack of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Step 8: Futility of Change**
    After escaping, Rick's car starts. He reveals that Zeep was forced back to the "Gooble Box technology" or risked his Microverse battery being thrown away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The episode concludes with Rick, Morty, and Summer calmly eating ice cream, with Morty and Summer shell-shocked by the normalcy after their intense journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This demonstrates that for television, the hero "can never be fulfilled" to ensure continued desire for new adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

While *Rick & Morty* often satirizes popular culture and subverts expectations, its underlying structure adheres closely to the typical television format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. However, the show uses this familiar circular structure to emphasize "the depressing, crippling futility of change," where characters like Rick often achieve their immediate goals without genuine personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Rick's re-enslavement of a planet for a mundane outcome like ice cream highlights this thematic core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Ultimately, even if Rick Sanchez disbelieves in many things, the creative team behind *Rick & Morty* strongly believes in the power of story structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

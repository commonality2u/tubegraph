Nihilism, often misunderstood as simply believing in nothing, actually encompasses various philosophical, psychological, and ethical positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While diverse, these forms of nihilism share the fundamental premise that life lacks inherent meaning, value, or order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Rather than a simplistic rejection of everything, [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] can serve as a foundation for meaningful worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

This article focuses on two primary branches: [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | existential nihilism]] and cosmic nihilism (also known as cosmic pessimism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Existential Nihilism

[[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | Existential nihilism]] arises from the realization that human existence has no inherent meaning, reducing life to a "precarious dance upon the grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Within this framework, individuals are responsible for creating meaning in their lives through their own freedom and decisions, establishing and sustaining their own values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This worldview is notably explored through the character of BoJack Horseman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, illustrating [[existential_nihilism_through_bojack_horseman | existential nihilism through BoJack Horseman]].

### Origins and Key Figures

The term "nihilism" was first coined in the late eighteenth century by German philosopher [[philosophers_influencing_existential_and_cosmic_nihilism | Friedrich Jacobi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Jacobi introduced the term in response to Enlightenment reason, fearing it would explain away the foundations of religion by rendering everything knowable and removing spaces of uncertainty or mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

One of the earliest [[philosophers_influencing_existential_and_cosmic_nihilism | philosophers]] to explore the implications of [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] was [[philosophers_influencing_existential_and_cosmic_nihilism | Søren Kierkegaard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Though he never used the term "existentialism," Kierkegaard is considered one of the fathers of modern [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Kierkegaard viewed despair as an essential component of the human experience, referring to it as the "sickness unto death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This human despair is dialectical, meaning individuals are constantly at odds with themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This despair can manifest in several ways:
*   Thinking nothing is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   Thinking everything is possible, leading to indecision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   Despair about being one's true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Despair because one cannot be who they imagine themselves to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

This despair is the source of the melancholy seen in many characters, like those in *BoJack Horseman* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Kierkegaard believed anxiety stemmed from the inherent uncertainty underlying every decision, considering it a manifestation of human freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The weight of these decisions leads to anxiety, described as standing at the edge of an abyss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For Kierkegaard, overcoming this anxiety and despair involves accepting the "comic absurdity of reality" and living by faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Here, faith represents the courage to pursue a meaningful existence despite a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

Nearly a century after Kierkegaard, [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | Jean-Paul Sartre]] developed the first explicitly [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | existentialist philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Sartre argued that [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | existentialism]] provides a means to respond to the universe's meaninglessness by creating meaning ourselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Although no inherent ethical value or comforting God exists, humans can forge meaning through their own lives, striving for significance despite despair and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. However, [[Existentialism and Jean Paul Sartres philosophy | existential nihilism]] offers no guarantees of a meaningful life; it is an ongoing responsibility to continually create meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Cosmic Nihilism (or, Pessimism)

Cosmic nihilism is a more cold and hyper-rational school of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. It posits that the universe contains no inherent truth or meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Furthermore, even human-constructed meanings—such as freedom, love, hope, and joy—are dismissed as mere myths or fables that function as coping mechanisms against the "empty void at the center of our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. For the cosmic nihilist, engagement in activities is acceptable while awaiting the universe's heat death, but any belief in genuine meaning creation is self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This philosophy aligns closely with Rick Sanchez's character in *Rick and Morty*, demonstrating [[nihilism_and_cosmic_pessimism_in_rick_and_morty | nihilism and cosmic pessimism in Rick and Morty]].

### Philosophical Influences

While not a cosmic nihilist himself, [[philosophers_influencing_existential_and_cosmic_nihilism | Friedrich Nietzsche]] is considered a "spiritual forefather" of this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. His famous adage, "God is dead," is often misinterpreted as simply meaning a lack of meaning or that "everything sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. However, cosmic nihilism is not a moral judgment or a counter-ethics to religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Unlike Nietzschean nihilism, cosmic nihilism adopts a "cold and rationalist approach" to meaning, asserting that existence has no inherent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. *Rick and Morty* amplifies this by not only portraying a cold and uncaring universe but emphasizing an infinite number of such universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Contemporary thought also contributes to cosmic nihilism:
*   **Eliminative Materialism:** Championed by [[philosophers_influencing_existential_and_cosmic_nihilism | Patricia and Paul Churchland]], this position argues that common sense psychological attitudes should be replaced by more scientific and empirical notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Ironically, for a married couple, they believe concepts like love should be dismissed as "folk psychology," viewing them merely as chemical reactions in the brain responding to stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This perspective aligns with Rick Sanchez's view that human emotions are "fundamentally bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Thomas Metzinger:** A [[philosophers_influencing_existential_and_cosmic_nihilism | philosopher]] whose ideas Rick Sanchez would likely favor, Metzinger argues that the human "self" is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Instead of an internal self, he posits that individuals are merely "jumbled networks of neurons and chemicals," and the self is a "useful fantasy" or "psychological fairytale" used to comprehend experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. If Metzinger is correct, humanity loses any real purpose or unique soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This trivialization of self and consciousness is a recurring theme in *Rick and Morty*, where Rick's creations often gain sentience and experience existential crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

This brand of [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] tends to be misanthropic, a trait associated with Rick Sanchez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. The freedom celebrated by existentialists is seen as another illusion for the cosmic nihilist, meaning there's no basis for ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. With only destruction being certain and no value to build an ethical system, one is free to do whatever they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

## Conclusion

Both [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | existential nihilism]] and cosmic nihilism are not about complete surrender but rather offer distinct approaches to navigating an uncertain world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Shows like *Rick and Morty* and *BoJack Horseman* provide [[philosophical_influences_in_media | philosophical influences in media]] and insight into the practical ramifications of [[the_philosophy_of_nihilism_and_existentialism | nihilism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

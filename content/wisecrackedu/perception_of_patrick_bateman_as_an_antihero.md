*American Psycho* has consistently been a subject of controversy, raising questions about its interpretation. One central debate revolves around the character of Patrick Bateman: is he an antihero, a villain, or something else entirely? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>

## Patrick Bateman's Facade and Reality

Patrick Bateman is introduced as a handsome, wealthy businessman in 1988, embodying the stereotype of a rich Wall Streeter more concerned with dining at trendy restaurants than working. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> His life appears to be one of artifice, with a beautiful fiancée and a close-knit group of friends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> However, beneath this superficial exterior, he harbors intense hatred for those around him and engages in brutal murders of homeless men and prostitutes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>

The film's narrative blurs the line between reality and fantasy as Bateman descends into madness and a gory killing spree. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a> Despite his numerous alleged murders, a shocking aspect of the film is that "nobody seems to care." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a> When Bateman confesses to the murder of his business rival, Paul Allen, he is told that Allen is still alive and was recently seen in London. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a> This raises the fundamental question of whether Patrick actually killed anyone or if it was "all in his head." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>

Initially, Patrick describes himself as merely a "shell of a person," stating, "there is no real me only an entity something illusory." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a> Yet, by the film's conclusion, after succumbing to his murderous desires, he paradoxically claims to be "in touch with humanity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a> This suggests that by giving in to his "baser desire to kill," he becomes "self actualized," albeit as a serial killer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>

## Societal and Audience Perception

### Ignorance of His Crimes
A significant aspect of Bateman's portrayal is how easily he is mistaken for other people, highlighting the interchangeable nature of individuals in a society obsessed with acquiring goods. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a> Paul mistakes him for Marcus, and later, Patrick's lawyer believes him to be someone named Davis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a> This demonstrates that "nobody cares much about any of the other people around them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a> in this superficial world.

Crucially, Patrick Bateman consistently tells other people he is a murderer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a> However, his confessions are either misheard as "mergers and acquisitions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a> or dismissed as a joke. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a> This implies that society is so absorbed in its own preoccupations that it fails to recognize or acknowledge the atrocities committed within its midst.

### The Allure of the Lifestyle
Despite Bateman's monstrous acts, there is an "undeniably seductive" quality about him and his lifestyle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a> This infatuation is evident in real-world phenomena, such as clothing lines based on his style, articles on replicating his grooming, and tours of his apartment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a> The film itself, despite being a savage critique, "does revel in excess." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a> Bateman is handsome, successful, and lives a life of luxury, which many viewers might find appealing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>

The film often plays Bateman's more monstrous acts as comedic or cuts away before the full impact is shown. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a> For example, Paul Allen's murder is set to Huey Lewis and the News, and the chainsaw murder of Christine only shows the "net result" rather than the "moment of impact." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a> This allows the audience to "identify more with the glitz and glamour and letting him off the hook for his more gruesome misdeeds." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>

## Bateman as an Anti-Establishment Antihero

Despite his monstrous actions, Patrick Bateman is often "lotted as an anti-establishment antihero." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a> This perception, however, may be a meta-textual comment by the film itself. Just as Bateman's confessions are misunderstood or dismissed, *American Psycho* (the film) has been "misinterpreted as misogynistic and pro-consumer" or treated as a "joke and a parody." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>

The core issues the film targets—a status-obsessed society, sexism, and wealth inequality—remain relevant. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a> This leads to the cynical conclusion that, much like Bateman's confession meaning nothing, the film's critique of society will also mean nothing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a> The film highlights that its deep satire on consumerism and male ego is often overshadowed by the very surface-level aspects it critiques. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>

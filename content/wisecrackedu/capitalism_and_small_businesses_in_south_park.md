The creators of *South Park*, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are known for their comedic genius, but they have also amassed significant wealth through their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite being an ad-supported business, *South Park* frequently critiques the financial world that sustains it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The show often lampoons various aspects of capitalism and economic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, with a particular focus on [[economic_lessons_from_south_park | Economics in South Park]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Critiquing the "Little Guy" in "Gnomes"

In the episode "Gnomes," *South Park* sets up a classic David-and-Goliath scenario between the large corporate coffee chain Harbucks and the local mom-and-pop shop, Tweek Brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, the show challenges the typical bias towards the small business by portraying the "little guy," Mr. Tweek, as an "asshole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Mr. Tweek is shown to be a ruthless capitalist who exploits his own son with caffeine and uses children for media attention to keep his business afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The idea that a small business can be driven by "impure capitalist motive" is an uncommon message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The townspeople of South Park are not prepared for this nuance, and they stereotype the Tweek and Harbucks rivalry as a simple "innocent family business versus" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Arguments in favor of big business are often met with "immature shouting" rather than reason or facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Mr. Tweek, despite his "folksy marketing," proves to be even more "cutthroat" than his corporate rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The pre-teen protagonists of the show become "convenient pawns in his agenda," forced to parrot his anti-corporate sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The town's programmatic response boils down to "small business good. Big corporation bad," without considering Mr. Tweek's true practices or the quality of Harbucks coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

This phenomenon is explained by the "backfire effect," where new, contrary information is dismissed if it threatens an individual's basic belief structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. "Gnomes" satirizes hardwired biases, demonstrating that small businesses, like small children, "can be just as scummy as their larger counterparts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Ultimately, both small and large businesses are depicted as being "geared towards making a profit," even if the path to that objective can be ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Branding Over Function in "Go Fund Yourself"

The episode "Go Fund Yourself" explores the modern economy's shift towards brand over substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The *South Park* kids launch a successful brand, the Washington Redskins, which operates without an actual business behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Their slogan, "We don't do anything!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, highlights their success through "Kickstarter culture," accepting donations for "no effort at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

The episode suggests that, in the age of social media, a company's success can be "rooted purely in its appearance rather than in its function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The emphasis is on the "relative power of its brand" rather than what the business actually does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Stan's quest for "the perfect startup name" is given more importance than any objective Cartman's leadership pursues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

This thesis mirrors the arguments of philosopher Jean Baudrillard, who proposed that "value is determined purely as the appearance of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. According to Baudrillard, an item or brand is valued "as it exists as an image in relation to other things that are also images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This means a great brand is more important than great products, and being trendy matters more to investors than making "fat stacks of cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, a concept exemplified by companies like Uber losing billions while being worth billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The *South Park* kids take this concept to "absurd heights," embracing the idea of "not doing anything at all â€” just: 'Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. However, the episode ultimately shows the kids' venture in shambles due to "brand's missteps on a social issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. A business built solely on aesthetics has "nowhere to turn" and "no foundational beliefs to hold to" once public opinion turns against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Even a business that does almost nothing can be threatened by doing or saying "the wrong thing at the wrong time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## The Social Media Economy in "You Have Zero Friends"

"You Have Zero Friends" delves into the "absurdities of our growing social media economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The episode questions whether friendships and social worth are measured by "likes" and Facebook connections or by "interactions we share in what the cyberpunk community derisively refers to as 'meatspace'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The protagonists initially quantify their social status "solely by their collections of online friendships," treating Facebook friendships like money, creating a "measurable hierarchy of personal value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Cartman, predictably, views relationships as "status symbols by which to elevate some people over others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This transactional approach to relationships is linked back to Baudrillard's *The Consumer Society*, which warned that such an approach "leads to an individual lack, since everything possessed is relativized in relation to others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Kyle, influenced by this view, prioritizes his social media cache over real-world friendships, even dropping a friend to salvage his online standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

The episode challenges viewers to consider "who are we, really, when our online presence outweighs our real-world engagements?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The disjunction between digital and real-world lives threatens to place a "greater premium on our digital behavior," making physical life seem "less significant and less like an experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The argument for cultivating an online brand is that "your cyber-influence casts a much wider net than you do alone," despite potentially being less authentic than the "real you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

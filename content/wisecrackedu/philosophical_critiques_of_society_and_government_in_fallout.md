The *Fallout* series, set in an alternate 23rd century where 1950s culture endured while most of humanity perished, offers a rich landscape for philosophical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The world was plunged into a "new dark age" after a global conflict, stemming from nations running out of oil in the 2050s and culminating in nuclear arsenals being launched in 2077 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The game constantly interrogates human society and government, suggesting that "War never changes" and, by extension, "humanity never changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Critique of Pre-War Society and Propaganda
*Fallout* explores how society, culture, and propaganda can lead people to make "really, really stupid things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. In this alternate reality, the mid-20th century fascination with atomic power proliferated unchecked by the invention of the transistor, leading to a technologically advanced society with bulky tech and primitive computers, yet also power armor and laser guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The post-apocalyptic "Wasteland" is filled with reminders of the pre-war world's "sheer optimism" regarding atomic energy, where even "giant anti-communist death robots" were seen as aiding humanity's greatest dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This optimism is most evident in the Vaults, which, despite many being covers for insane government experiments, maintained a "certain cheeriness" even when nuclear annihilation was imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | Cognitive Dissonance]] and One-Dimensional Thought
The Vaults exemplify human [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | cognitive dissonance]], advertising the prospect of being locked underground as an "exciting foray" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse critiqued this phenomenon, arguing that "pleasant appearances plastered over modern day nightmares" demonstrate modern society's ability to "destroy criticism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Capitalism, according to Marcuse, is so adept at marketing that it makes even the "worst shit in the world just seem 'dandy'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. He cited real-life "deluxe fallout shelters" as the ultimate example of the "obscene merger" between a "cozy luxury getaway" and a terrible reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

This disparity between appearance and reality is a key element of *Fallout*'s humor, juxtaposing "quaint and cheery Leave-it-to-Beaver-esque culture" with the "hellscape it’s set in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Examples include radio stations playing chipper jazz tunes while players fend off irradiated remnants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, and the game's trailer using "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire" against imagery of burnt Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The song "Anything Goes," about lax morals, nods to the anarchy of the Wasteland where cannibalism is fair game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

These ironic pairings are not just comedic; they represent a societal mechanism that celebrates the very culture and [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] that brought humanity to the brink of annihilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Marcuse called this "one-dimensional thought," where the merging of positive and negative means rationality and [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] can only move "forward," and there is no room for "negative thought" or ideas that undermine society's "inane positivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This is illustrated by *Fallout 3*'s opening, where the player is forced to have "a sufficient amount of fun" at their birthday party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Critiques of Post-War Governance and Security Logic
The game also critiques the various forms of [[factions_and_politics_in_fallout | government]] and [[factions_and_politics_in_fallout | factions]] that emerge in the Wasteland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### The Enclave and Distracted Society
The Enclave, remnants of the U.S. [[factions_and_politics_in_fallout | government]], seeks to purge the Wasteland. Their computer president, John Henry Eden, uses radio addresses to praise things like baseball as a "savior to the American dream," attempting to resurrect the "distracted society" that led to the apocalypse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The Wasteland is "littered with reminders of our own excess" – leisure suits, magazines, televisions – highlighting how such comforts provide an "easy way to cope with the horrific reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | Technology]] Run Amok
*Fallout* constantly reminds players of [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] run amok, from the Great War to secret government experiments creating Super Mutants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It presents [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] as a "double edged sword" and poses moral dilemmas about its use, such as whether to purify the Wasteland's water or unleash a devastating virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

The game draws inspiration from the Greek myth of Phaethon, who ruined the Earth by mishandling Helios's sun chariot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. In *New Vegas*, the solar plant is called Helios One, and the player can similarly wield its destructive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Two responses to [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] are seen in the Brotherhood of Steel and Caesar's Legion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>:
*   **Brotherhood of Steel**: This secretive order hoards lost [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] in armored bases, believing no one can be trusted with it but themselves, even going to war with [[factions_and_politics_in_fallout | factions]] possessing advanced tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Caesar's Legion**: They swear off [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] (except for weapons), believing it makes people weak and dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Despite this, their brutal totalitarian state still manages to create a "living hell," suggesting [[impact_of_technology_and_cognitive_dissonance_in_fallout | technology]] isn't solely to blame for humanity's failings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### International Relations and Security Logic
*Fallout* also explains modern theories of international relations through its [[factions_and_politics_in_fallout | factions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>:
*   **Hegemonic Stability Theory**: Caesar's Legion, superficially modeled after the Roman Empire, seeks to unite humanity under a "dystopian nightmare" where everyone is a slave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Caesar believes peace comes through security and is only attainable when his Legion is the sole dominant [[factions_and_politics_in_fallout | faction]], a concept known as "hegemonic stability theory" where a superpower frightens others into behaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This largely works in the game, with Legion territory being safer for traders due to the elimination of raiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Balance of Power**: An alternative is a balance of power, where war is too costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The NCR avoids invading New Vegas not out of benevolence, but because the cost would be too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The Boomers, like a "post-apocalyptic Switzerland," maintain their neutrality through constant artillery fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Realist Model**: Under a "realist" model, each [[factions_and_politics_in_fallout | faction]] is only self-interested, power is a "zero-sum game," and security is ensured by having more resources than the next group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Alliances are fleeting, existing only to combat more powerful threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This model highlights a core critique: such an approach precludes true trust and cooperation between [[factions_and_politics_in_fallout | factions]], echoing the mentality that led to nuclear holocaust in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

The diplomatic stakes in *Fallout* are high, as every issue is a "life and death struggle for the soul of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. The game forces players to consider how far they will go to maintain security, such as whether the NCR should resort to bullying and corruption for democracy's sake, or if the player should murder obstacles for clean water instead of seeking diplomacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### The Problem with "Security Logic"
Philosophers like Daniel Callahan argue that "security logic" is totalizing, with "no limit in the amount of terrible, grotesque things we are willing to do in the name of survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This is echoed by Benjamin Franklin's quote: "Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The Enclave President John Henry Eden exemplifies this, stating he cannot discuss his election details due to "national security," and the Enclave will exterminate mutated "riff raff" to save "real" humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. In *New Vegas*, Mr. House's ending portrays a "despotic vision of pre-War glory" with orderly, efficient, and cold streets, where chaos is tamed "at the expense of personal freedoms and democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Mr. House explicitly states his distaste for freedom, advocating for "firm control in the hands of a technological and economic visionary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Historically, dictators manufacture crises and exaggerate threats to justify repressive laws, a tactic abundantly available in *Fallout*'s world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

The scariest parts of the Wasteland are not just feral ghouls and super mutants, but a "rehashing of our own regrettable history," including "slavery obsessed Romans, Orwellian dictatorships, and genocidal governments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. *Fallout* demonstrates that "History, it seems, does repeat itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Released in 2006, the film *Idiocracy* has become a cult classic, celebrated not only for its humor but for its political prescience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Many perceive it as a cultural artifact reflecting societyâ€™s gradual degeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. In the film's America, a pro-wrestler serves as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, politics has devolved into shouting matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, people gamble for healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, and corporations feign care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Its screenwriter, Etan Cohen, even noted in 2016 that *Idiocracy* had become a documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Anti-intellectualism as Portrayed in *Idiocracy*

*Idiocracy* was made during the Bush era and is infused with critiques of anti-intellectualism prevalent in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The film depicts a world where the protagonist, Joe Bauers, is repeatedly called a "fag" for sounding smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. People struggle with basic tasks like counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> or reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The justice system is reduced to a farce based on nonsensical appeals to "common sense," where the prosecutor simply says, "Okay, number one, your honor, just look at him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Criminal justice resembles a gladiator fight combined with a monster truck rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This vision suggests a world where "illiterate yokels" ruin democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## The Rise of Pseudo-intellectualism

However, some argue that contemporary society does not live in an anti-intellectual environment, but rather a "pseudo-intellectual" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Anti-intellectualism**: Involves people "balking at those who read books, appreciate art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, resembling the world of *Idiocracy* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Pseudo-intellectualism**: Involves people acting as if they appreciate scholarship and information, but are "largely full of shit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Examples of Pseudo-intellectualism

[[impact_of_conspiracy_theories_on_society | Conspiracy theories]] and pseudo-science offer prime examples of pseudo-intellectualism:
*   **Flat Earthers**: These individuals are not simply "dumb-dumbs," but rather dive deep into "rabbit holes" with websites full of what they present as "real arguments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. They even purchase expensive equipment like a $20,000 laser gyroscope to "prove" their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, presenting "evidence," "complicated formulas," and "appeals to rational logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Disproving these falsehoods can be time-consuming because they invoke concepts like flight plans and special relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Anti-vaxxers**: Similarly, anti-vaxxers often cite their own "MDs and scientific articles," even if debunked, as "proof" to assert their views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Anti-vaxxerism can spread even in "hyper-educated places like Silicon Valley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, demonstrating that a lack of education is not always the root cause.

## The "Uneducated Ruining Everything" Narrative

The notion that the uneducated are ruining society, popular especially on the left, does not always hold true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. For instance, Democrats who accused the Tea Party of being "illiterate country bumpkins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> had to contend with the fact that Tea Party members were often "wealthier and more educated than the general public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Contemporary political discourse, despite being "lively" and often filled with "bullshit and deranged anger," is not characterized by an aversion to logic and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Instead, it involves the embracing of "a different kind" of logic and information, which is "arguably, way, way worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The core issue is not a lack of appreciation for knowledge, but a disagreement on "how to evaluate knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Eugenics as Pseudo-science

*Idiocracy* presents a specific theory for societal decline: "dumb, irresponsible people have tons of dumb, irresponsible kids at rates that vastly exceeds that of your 'upstanding' citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This idea, where "feeble-mindedness" was thought to spread "like a disease," gained popularity through movements like Eugenics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Henry Herbert Goddard's influential book, *The Kallikak Family*, studied a family line to "prove" how "feeble-mindedness" (a term he coined) was inherited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. His work, though later renounced by Goddard himself, fueled the Eugenics movement and led to forced sterilization programs in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The Supreme Court even upheld a sterilization law, stating that "three generations of imbeciles are enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Despite *Idiocracy*'s portrayal, IQ scores have been increasing on average by 3 points every decade, meaning the idea of the world getting dumber due to procreation rates is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Mike Judge's take on anti-intellectualism in *Idiocracy* is certainly funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, it is "maybe not nearly as prophetic as some would like to think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The film is a "hilarious snapshot of early 2000's paranoia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> that functions as a "cautionary tale of what happens when people cede their ability to think critically and just become mindless consumers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

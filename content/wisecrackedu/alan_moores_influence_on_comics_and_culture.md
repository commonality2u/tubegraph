Alan Moore, a prolific author, is celebrated for creating some of the most acclaimed comics of all time, including *Watchmen*, *Miracleman*, and *The Killing Joke* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Moore navigates a "thin line between genius and insanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, publicly declaring himself a "magician" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. His approach to magic is not about parlor tricks, but akin to a "Steven Strange variety that consults grimoires and conjures demons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Beneath what might initially seem like superstition, Moore presents a "pretty fascinating [[philosophy_and_magic_of_alan_moore | philosophy]] at play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Philosophy and Magic of Alan Moore

Moore's unique perspective on magic is deeply rooted in Hermeticism, an "occult tradition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> that is less a religion and more a collection of "interrelated practices and principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Hermeticism and its Principles
Hermeticism aims to understand the world through three methods:
*   **Alchemy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   **Astrology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   **Theurgy**: The process of achieving spiritual perfection to draw nearer to God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

These teachings are largely derived from the *Corpus Hermeticum*, attributed to the mythical Hermes Trismegistus, a blend of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, both deities of Language and Wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. For Moore, this "mixture of language and understanding is the heart of magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Moore's Definition of Magic
In his work *The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic*, Moore defines magic as "a purposeful engagement with the phenomena and possibilities of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. He posits that reality consists of two categories:
*   **Material**: Physical elements like matter, energy, space, time, and fundamental forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **Immaterial**: The mental model of the world constructed by the brain from sensory input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Moore illustrates how the material and immaterial profoundly influence each other:
*   An "ephemeral idea" in Moore's mind (immaterial) transformed into the tangible pages of *Watchmen* through artist Dave Gibbons' work (material) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, the physical sound of a voice (material) can alter perception (immaterial), as demonstrated by conjuring the image of Doctor Manhattan's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Moore describes this as "cast[ing] a genuine spell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

> "Magic bridges the divide between the material and the immaterial. Art, language, symbols – these are the real wizard’s wands." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>
> "Magic is intrinsically connected with art, language and consciousness to the point where these four things almost become different aspects of the same phenomenon." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>

This concept is akin to the rabbit-duck illusion, where initial perception can be changed by new information, transforming what is seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Storytelling, in this sense, functions as "spell-craft," capable of both casting and dispelling illusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Magic as a Tool for Societal and Personal Change
Moore, as an anarchist, views money as a "destructive illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. In *Miracleman*, the character abolishes money, declaring it "imaginary. Real if we believe in it…" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

The ability to magically alter something by changing perception is central to *Promethea*. In the comic, when protagonist Sophie and her companions confront the demon-king Asmodeus, his appearance shifts from monstrous to human once they "accept that so-called demons are just a part of human-nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Asmodeus explains: "Approach us with fear, with hatred and revulsion, and we will be fearsome, hateful, and vile. Approach us humanely and with respect, and we will be human and respectable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. This emphasizes that for a magician, "expectation creates perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. Doctor Manhattan in *Watchmen* exemplifies this, appearing as an "ageless aquamarine Adonis with alopecia" solely because that is how he "internally perceives himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

## Mapping Reality: Hermetic Principles in Comics
Moore explores the idea that if a compelling story can change perception of a single phenomenon, an encompassing story could change the perception of "all the phenomena in existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. In *Promethea*, he aims to do exactly that, telling "a story about everything as a spell to change our perceptions about everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

### Macrocosm and Microcosm ("As Above, So Below")
One of Hermeticism's core principles is "macrocosm and microcosm," expressed as "As above, so below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This principle suggests that "every level of reality reflects every other, like an infinite fractal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Understanding one part of the pattern enables a better understanding of the whole, allowing movement from lower to higher levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

Moore structures *Promethea* deliberately around this principle, basing it on the Khabbalah's Tree of Life. This structure, representing both the "entirety of existence" and "each individual soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, serves as a "roadmap to all reality, including our inner lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>:
*   **Bottom rung**: Mere perception (seeing the rabbit or duck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **Above**: Imagination (making mental models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
*   **Further up**: Capacity for art and language (tying ideas to symbols and stories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **Highest**: Capacities for emotion and reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

At a macroscopic level, the physical universe is the "basest sphere of the world's soul," followed by humanity's collective unconscious, and at the very top, "The All. The One. God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. The series itself is 32 issues long, corresponding to the ten Spheres and twenty-two Paths of The Tree of Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>, with the 32nd issue acting as a "deliberate microcosm of the series as a whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

### Solve et Coagula ("Separate and Combine")
Another Hermetic principle employed by Moore is *Solve et Coagula*, meaning "Separate and Combine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This involves "breaking a thing down into its component parts to better understand how the whole fits together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

*   In *Watchmen*, Doctor Manhattan's arc illustrates this principle. Initially, he excels at "separate," mentally breaking down humans into "base components," leading to his detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. His breakthrough on Mars involves learning to "recombine and perceive them as holistic four-dimensional objects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   In *Promethea*'s sixth issue, Sophie defeats the writer Marto Neptura, who controls the land of fiction, by understanding that "Neptura was the collective pen name of various novelists cut down to his separate unique styles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## The World's End as a Shift in Perception
Moore believes that when a story becomes "so complete a model of the world that it changes the perception of our entire species," it leads to the "World end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>—a transformation of collective consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

In *Promethea*, Sophie achieves the Apocalypse by explaining the same Hermetic principles, causing everyone to perceive the immaterial and material worlds as "equally 'real'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This represents humanity's "leap from sea to land...From matter to mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Moore attributes the origin of human culture to a similar leap from matter to mind, driven by "representation," which led to language, consciousness, and subsequently "the entirety of human culture: writing, painting, song, music, theatre, science, medicine and even politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

### Moore's Prophecy and *Jerusalem*
Moore himself contemplated how our world might end similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. In a 1999 issue of *Promethea*, he used Tarot to trace the world's history from the Big Bang to a "coming leap to expanded consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. He predicted the "end of the world as we know it" in 2017, when the sum total of human knowledge would double every half second, necessitating new ways of understanding the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

Though 2017 passed without a cataclysmic end, Moore attempted to "herald the Apocalypse" himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. In September 2016, he released his magnum opus, *Jerusalem*, viewing it not merely as a book, but as a "ten-year ritual working that is intended to have a certain (hopefully beneficial) effect upon the consciousness of its readership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. He considers *Jerusalem* his "most sophisticated and complex magical working thus far, and certainly the most ambitious in its aims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

In *Jerusalem*, Moore employs writing techniques to make the reader experience the higher states of consciousness described, akin to how the Heptapod's language in *Arrival* affects perception of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. A chapter from Lucia Joyce's perspective, for instance, mimics her father's *Finnegans Wake* with puns and neologisms to replicate her mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Moore suggests that individuals exhibiting "certain forms of insanity might be closer to perceiving external reality than those who are deemed 'sane'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

Doctor Manhattan, in *Watchmen*, perceives every moment of his life simultaneously, which Moore, like Einstein, considers a more "sane" perspective than humanity's "stubbornly persistent illusion" of linear time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. To habituate readers to perceiving more dimensions, Moore applies *Solve et Coagula* to language itself, separating "phonetics" (how words sound) from "graphetics" (how words appear) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. He writes dialogue that appears as "gibberish" but makes phonetic sense, forcing readers to discern "multiple layers of meaning in every word" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. This technique serves as both "explanation and example," magically altering how the mind models the world by changing the language used to construct that model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

## Is Magic Real?
Moore's work suggests that if he is right, magic is "at least as real as our imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. *Promethea*'s ultimate "Revelation" speaks directly to the reader:
> "I’m an idea, but I’m a real idea. I’m the idea of human imagination, which, when you think about it, is the only thing we can really be certain isn’t imaginary… I’m imagination. I’m real and I’m the best friend you’ve ever had. Who do you think got you all this cool stuff? The clothes you wear, the room, the house, the city that you’re in. Everything in it started out in human imagination. Your lives, your personalities, your whole world. All invented… There’s nothing here but a funny little twist of amino acids playing a marvelous game of pretend." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>

The highly imaginative works of Alan Moore are a testament to the power of imagination itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. Given his status as "the most influential writer in the history of comics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>, Moore's literary efforts are likely to remain influential for centuries, continuing to bridge the material and immaterial through the magic of storytelling.

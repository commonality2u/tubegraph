*Rick and Morty* frequently inverts common clichés and tropes to provide thought-provoking insights into various aspects of life, including the nature of individualism and conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The show often takes popular fears of conformity to critique basic societal values and delve into characters' inner psyches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## "Auto Erotic Assimilation"

The episode "Auto Erotic Assimilation" directly addresses themes of conformity and individualism through the character of Unity, Rick's ex-girlfriend, who is a hivemind collective that assimilates alien races by puking into their mouths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

This concept references the 1956 film *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, where aliens replace people with emotionless replicas, a trope often read as a commentary on the threat of the Soviet Union and the loss of individualism under Communist rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. However, *Rick and Morty* inverts this narrative by demonstrating that the freedom associated with individualism "can actually kind of suck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

*Rick and Morty* contrasts the anxiety about Communism destroying individualism, as portrayed in *The Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, with "the very-not-fictional horrors of our own freedoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. For instance, the inhabitants of Unity’s planet recall their previous lives as sex offenders and drug addicts, and their liberation from the collective sparks a "nipple-driven race war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

This tension between individual freedom and collective existence further develops Rick's character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Being part of a family or a relationship inherently involves compromising individual freedoms for the good of the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Rick’s rampant egotism consistently impedes his relationships, including destroying his relationship with Unity and her entire society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Ultimately, it is Rick who makes Unity lose her sense of self in their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

This episode suggests that while conformity might be seen as a loss of self, unrestrained individualism, particularly Rick's egotism, can lead to destruction and a loss of connection. This [[themes_of_mental_health_in_rick_and_morty | psychological analysis of Rick]] highlights the challenges of balancing personal freedom with the demands of collective existence.

## "Lawnmower Dog"

The episode "Lawnmower Dog" also touches on these themes through the character of Snuffles, the family dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Rick makes Snuffles intelligent enough to stop peeing on the rug, but accidentally makes him smart enough to subjugate the entire human race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Snuffles rejects his "slave name" in favor of "Snowball," a reference to the pig in George Orwell's *Animal Farm* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

Similar to *Animal Farm*, where creatures rebel against human exploitation and then slowly transform into their former oppressors, the interspecies war in *Rick and Morty* sees Snuffles rebelling against the lazy life of pethood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, unlike *Animal Farm*, a dystopian nightmare is averted in *Rick and Morty* when Snowball realizes he is slowly turning into everything he hated about humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This implies a critique of how even revolutionary movements, initially driven by a desire for freedom from oppression, can fall into similar patterns of control and conformity, potentially losing their original ideals.

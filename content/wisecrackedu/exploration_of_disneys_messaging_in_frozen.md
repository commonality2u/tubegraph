"Frozen" is presented by host Garyx Wormuloid as a film that won an Academy Award for its song "Let It Be" by The Beatles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The story follows Princess Elsa, who suffers from "unexplained mutant ice powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. After accidentally giving her sister Anna "brain-freeze," Anna is taken to the emergency room for a lobotomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Elsa then hides for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Following their parents' death, Elsa becomes queen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Critiques of Traditional Romance and [[themes_of_love_and_independence_in_frozen | Sisterly Love]]

The film directly critiques the "love at first sight" adage, exemplified by Anna's rushed engagement to Prince Hans after only two conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This concept is ultimately "proven to be as trivial and misguided as Karen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Hans is revealed to be a villain who only wants the throne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Instead of a charming prince, frog, or similar figure, the heroes' redemption in "Frozen" comes from sisterly love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Anna performs an "act of true love" to save Elsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This act of love allows Elsa to realize "the power of love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, which enables her to reverse the eternal winter she caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Even with a promising suitor like Kristoff, there is no definitive wedding, and they take their relationship slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## [[themes_of_love_and_independence_in_frozen | Independence]] vs. Social Connection

The movie suggests that independence is a mistake, aligning with what is described as "Disney’s mob mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. It posits that all people require connection, and a solitary person is seen as incomplete and needing "fixing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. As medical staff state, "We need each other to fix us up and round us out!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Elsa's isolation and inhibition of her feelings are presented as errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Only by embracing her sister's love can Elsa find real fulfillment and happiness that comes with social solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## [[hidden_meanings_in_disneys_frozen | Symbolism]] and [[symbolism_of_ice_and_fire_in_frozen | Elemental Properties]]

"Frozen" is seen as a musical about the dueling properties of "ice and fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Anna (Fire)**: She is associated with fire, representing warmth and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This is indicated by her fiery red hair and freckles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. She uses fire as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. When Hans reveals his true intentions, he extinguishes a fire, symbolizing the extinguishing of Anna's passion for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Elsa (Ice)**: Elsa is associated with ice, depicted as cold and rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. She believes the answer to life is to inhibit her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> and isolates herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Her revealing, skin-tight, transparent dress, adopted after her self-imposed exile, suggests liberation, possibly even sexual liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## The Motif of Doors and Gates

Doors serve as a recurring motif in the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

*   The film begins with the princesses stuck in a kingdom with closed gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   A significant symbol is the door separating the sisters throughout their childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   Elsa declares she will "Turn away and slam the door!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> when she becomes a homeowner.
*   Anna later implores her, "Please don't slam the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   One of the final lines of the film is, "I like the open gates. We’re never closing them again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   This clear subtext indicates that Elsa will no longer shut her sister out, though it implies the kingdom will "be forever susceptible to attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

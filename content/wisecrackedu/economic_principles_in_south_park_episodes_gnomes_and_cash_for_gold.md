[[south_park_and_capitalism | South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker]] often use their show to satirize various aspects of society, including the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Despite being an ad-supported business, [[south_park_and_capitalism | South Park]] has consistently critiqued economic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This article explores economic principles lampooned in two episodes: "Gnomes" and "Cash for Gold."

## "Gnomes": Challenging Small Business Bias

In the episode "Gnomes," [[south_park_and_capitalism | South Park]] depicts a conflict between the large corporate coffee chain Harbucks and the local, family-owned Tweek Brothers coffee shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This scenario challenges the common assumption that small businesses are inherently virtuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Instead, Mr. Tweek, the owner of Tweek Brothers, is portrayed as a "total asshole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He exploits his own son with caffeine and manipulates children for media attention to keep his business solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This reveals that small businesses can be driven by "impure capitalist motive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> and can be even more "cutthroat" than their larger rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The townspeople, accustomed to stereotyping the rivalry as "innocent family business versus" big corporations, are not ready for this nuanced view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Arguments favoring big business are often met with "immature shouting" rather than reason or facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The episode "Gnomes" illustrates how "bald-faced appeals to emotion" can obscure the true "mechanisms of profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### The Backfire Effect

The townspeople's programmatic response of "small business good. Big corporation bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> is explained by the **backfire effect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This principle states that new, contrary information will be dismissed if it threatens one's basic belief structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The episode satirizes these hardwired biases by demonstrating that small businesses, like their larger counterparts, are ultimately "geared towards making a profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## "Cash for Gold": Deconstructing Value Theory

The episode "Cash for Gold" critiques the exploitation of the elderly for massive profit, particularly through the Home Shopping Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The narrative examines both the "predator and the prey" through the lens of **value theory** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Different Forms of Value

While value can be dictated by "supply and demand," it can also be rooted in social, emotional, or historical contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These alternative forms of value are situational and fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

An example is Stan's grandfather receiving a $6000 bolo tie from a TV scam, which is quickly appraised at only $15 locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This highlights the "market value" presented by the Home Shopping Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The host, Dean, uses his authority to create a "high perceived value" for items that have "low actual value" in terms of material or resale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This disconnect is the core mechanism of a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

[[south_park_and_capitalism | South Park]] suggests that value is determined not by quality or production effort, but by the dynamics of "supply and demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Dean, the Home Shopping Network host, embodies a purely financial view of value, conceptualizing even his own life's worth in monetary terms for a lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Emotional and Historical Value

In contrast, Stan's grandpa's purchases are driven by a desire to add "emotional and historical value" to himself, creating lasting memories and sentimental connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This contrasts with the fluctuating financial value seen elsewhere in the episode, such as an Academy Award being melted down for resale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Ultimately, the episode shows that the "true value of nearly everything" can be called into question, with items like a framed photo having "astronomic emotional value but low market value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

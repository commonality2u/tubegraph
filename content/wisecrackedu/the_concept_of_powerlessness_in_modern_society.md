The idea of modern alienation, specifically the notion that society may be slowly destroying our souls, is a recurring theme explored through various characters and scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This concept suggests a fundamental loss of agency and control in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Jerry as the "Everyman"

Jerry is often presented as the embodiment of modern powerlessness, characterized by a complete lack of personal resolve, power, or agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. He is portrayed as a "doormat to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> and the "pinnacle of modern stoogery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. His inability to assert himself is evident in nearly all his interactions, particularly with Rick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Morty's resentment towards Jerry is deeply rooted in this observed powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. In a satirical twist, Jerry thrives in societies "devoid of freedom," indicating his poor capacity for true personal agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Causes of Powerlessness

### Industrialization and Monotonous Labor
Since the Industrial Revolution, there have been complaints about the loss of control in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Instead of individuals having their own trade or farm, many now "toil away at monotonous jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This loss of autonomy is a widely recognized phenomenon reflected in various forms of media and scholarly work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Societal Systems and Control
Societal systems, such as the Galactic Federation, are depicted as actively maintaining compliance and docility among the populace through the "liberal use of pharmaceuticals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This represents a systemic method of suppressing individual agency and perpetuating powerlessness.

### [[Technology and societal disconnect | Modern Comforts]] and Banal Existence
The series suggests that [[Technology and societal disconnect | modern comforts]] and industrialization can inherently lead to alienation and a reduction in meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. When a post-apocalyptic wasteland introduces electricity and industrialization, its inhabitants transition from a violent, active lifestyle to "everyday banalities," such as grocery shopping for human bits or complaining about recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Instead of fighting in a "Blood Dome," people watch "blood-dome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This shift implies that the absence of external threats and the presence of convenience cause people to "resort to bickering about trivialities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

> "Modern life is its own special brand of soul crushing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
> "Our comforts eventually alienate us from meaning, creating different kinds of misery." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>

## Escape from Powerlessness

A contrasting view of Jerry, from "Cronenberg Earth," shows him as a "total badass" when "stripped of the trappings of modern society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This suggests that the constraints and comforts of modern life might be what hinder personal growth and agency.

There is speculation that Jerry might undergo significant character development, potentially having a "Tyler Durden moment" where he transforms from a "disaffected modern buffoon to a man of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This potential arc highlights a desire to see individuals reclaim agency from the pervasive powerlessness of modern existence.

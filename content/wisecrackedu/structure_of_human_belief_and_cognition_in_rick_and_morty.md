The *Rick and Morty* episode "Get Schwifty" offers a complex exploration of human belief systems and cognition, particularly focusing on how people rationalize their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The show often trivializes what people hold dear, including religion, which is a regular victim of Rick's contempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While *Rick and Morty* frequently reduces religion to superstition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, "Get Schwifty" delves deeper into the complexities of such outlooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Critiquing Organized Religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
The episode quickly satirizes the opportunistic nature of organized religion. When the giant Cromulon heads appear, causing global catastrophes, the church is shown prioritizing financial contributions and a new church organ over genuine crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Genesis of Headism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
The cult of Headism emerges from a "cosmic problem in point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Lacking knowledge that the Cromulons are filming a reality show, and unaware of what "SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!" truly means, humanity naturally forms a cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While the episode could be seen as a scathing indictment of religion, it presents a more nuanced view by targeting the reasoning behind belief structures themselves, exposing fallacies in various forms of human belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Logical Fallacies and Rationalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
"Get Schwifty" highlights two common logical fallacies that conflate correlation with causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
This fallacy, the mistaken belief that two simultaneous unrelated events are causally linked, is central to the Headist religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Principal Vagina's prayer coincides with the cessation of cataclysmic events, leading to the false conclusion that his prayer caused the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. In reality, the Heads were pleased by Rick's impromptu performance of "Get Schwifty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Later, when Principal Vagina attempts to ascend Beth and Jerry, the Heads begin booing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The Headists interpret this as the Heads being angry at their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, but the Heads are actually displeased with Rick's terrible performance without Morty and a nuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
This fallacy is the idea that because one thing precedes another, it must be the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The President demonstrates this by believing that naming celebrities like The Dream, Billy Corgan, Randy Newman, and Pharrell causes their deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Aristotle was the first to list logical fallacies, aiming to identify arguments that "sounded great but are actually pure ass-clownery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The episode shows how characters with limited perspectives, unaware of the reality show, believe their mundane ceremonies influence cosmic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Beth and Jerry occasionally point out these logical fallacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## The Human Brain and Belief Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
The episode argues that people don't just hold silly beliefs out of pure irrationality; rather, they "over rationalise their thinking to the point of absurdity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Cognitive psychologists suggest that pseudo-scientific belief systems are resilient because they are sustained by the structure of the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. These systems persist through appeals to rationality, not trickery or stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The human brain is "hard-wired to search for logical conclusions and easy explanations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This explains why people tend to believe what aligns with their worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Confirmation Bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
[[Conformity and individualism in Rick and Morty | Confirmation bias]] is the propensity to seek out and interpret information that confirms one's existing beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This bias explains why individuals might overlook glaring flaws in a belief system for personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. For example, Summer's family ignores the cult's questionable practices because Summer is "thriving" within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Broader Implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
While *Rick and Morty* enjoys [[critique_of_religion_and_belief_systems_in_rick_and_morty | satirizing religion]], the episode ultimately suggests that post hoc rationalization is an inevitability of the human "cause and effect thought process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Even the audience can be fooled by the brain's tendency to accept logical fallacies, as demonstrated by Rick's snake and wristwatch trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The trick plays on the desire to attribute event A as the cause of event B, even when there's no actual link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The episode delivers the irony that cosmic events leading to a religion can be based on woefully inaccurate interpretations, with belief structures built on something as inane as a reality TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Beyond this, *Rick and Morty* challenges the human ability to make predictions and comprehend the complexity of existence itself, ensuring that "nothing is safe. Not even belief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

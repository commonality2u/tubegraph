*Rick and Morty* Season 3 Episode 6, "Rest and Ricklaxation," delves into the "toxic side" of the titular duo, using their experiences to offer a sharp [[satire_and_social_commentary_in_rick_and_morty | commentary]] on mental health and the prevailing self-help culture in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The episode stands out for addressing character development in an unconventional way while exploring interesting ideas about mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## "Anti-Character Development"

The episode features Rick and Morty taking a mental detox at an alien spa, where they shed the parts of themselves they dislike most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This process results in "Healthy-Morty" becoming popular and confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, while "Healthy-Rick" transforms into a seemingly normal, thoughtful super-genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

This narrative approach is termed "anti-character development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. While many stories, following Joseph Campbell's "The Hero's Journey," involve protagonists overcoming a "shadow" or dark reflection of themselves (like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, "Rest and Ricklaxation" subverts this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Instead of overcoming their toxic traits, Rick and Morty embark on a journey to reunite with their worst selves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For Morty, this means rediscovering his self-loathing, and for Rick, his narcissism and irrational care for Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The show suggests that "regular" character development, aiming to purge negative traits, can be "pretty creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Parody of Modern Mental Health Attitudes

This "anti-character development" serves as a commentary on how mental health is often portrayed in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The episode acts as an extended parody of certain "healthy" attitudes promoted by self-help gurus and popular media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

The show critiques the idea that mental health involves eliminating any unpleasant or painful thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It targets the notion, often seen in "Insta-llectuals," that being mentally healthy means uncritically loving oneself, saying yes to everything, counting blessings, and believing in oneself regardless of the folly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. *Rick and Morty* demonstrates that fully embodying these ideals can make one seem like a "coked-out weirdo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Compulsory Happiness and Capitalism

The episode touches on sociologist William Davies' concept of "compulsory happiness," detailed in his book *The Happiness Industry* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Davies argues that in the modern world, corporations, managers, and advertisers promote a definition of mental health that serves capitalist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This "happiness" involves cheerfully accepting the status quo and constant self-improvement for the sake of being a better consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Morty's Transformation into a Sociopath

"Healthy-Morty" exemplifies this critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. He spouts platitudes reminiscent of self-help gurus like Tony Robbins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, demanding that others partake in his new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. When faced with real problems, his response is a detached "Trust me things are good. Taking that away from me… that wouldn’t be healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The show highlights a crucial point: many traits the self-help industry encourages people to erase, such as self-doubt and sadness, are in fact important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. In Morty's case, self-doubt is what prevents him from becoming a full-on sociopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Indeed, "Healthy-Morty" quickly transforms into an unscrupulous stockbroker, likened to a "sociopathic Wall Street fat cat with too much self-esteem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Rick's Realization

Rick ultimately realizes that some of the "less desirable" parts of oneself, despite causing pain, are essential to truly being healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Morty's authentic, "self-hating self" is portrayed as his "better self," with Jessica even welcoming him back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## A Minor Inconsistency

Despite the strong message, a minor inconsistency is noted: the definition of "toxicity" is subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. "Healthy-Rick" initially expresses pride in being Morty's grandpa but later labels his attachment to Morty as "irrational" and therefore "toxic," leading to his nonchalant abandonment of Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This raises a question about whether his love for Morty is toxic or healthy within the show's framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

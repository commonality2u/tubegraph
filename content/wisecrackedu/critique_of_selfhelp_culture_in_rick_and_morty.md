The *Rick and Morty* Season 3 episode "Rest and Ricklaxation" offers a sharp [[rick_and_morty_episode_analysis | critique]] of contemporary self-help culture and prevalent ideas about [[themes_of_mental_health_in_rick_and_morty | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The episode presents an "anti-character development" arc, where the protagonists must reunite with their "toxic" traits rather than overcome them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## "Rest and Ricklaxation" Premise

After a near-death experience, Rick and Morty realize they are burned out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They visit an alien spa and use a "mental detoxifier" that purges the parts of themselves they dislike most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This results in "Healthy-Morty," who is popular and confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, and "Healthy-Rick," who is a thoughtful and seemingly "normal human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The "toxic" versions of themselves escape and cause global chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Anti-Character Development

The episode subverts the traditional "Hero's Journey" narrative, where protagonists confront and overcome their "shadow" selves to gain new insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Instead, "Rest and Ricklaxation" depicts a journey where Rick and Morty must reunite with their worst traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Healthy-Morty, initially a "smooth operator," ultimately needs to rediscover his self-loathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Similarly, Healthy-Rick, a thoughtful super-genius, needs to rediscover his narcissism and irrational care for Morty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Parody of "Healthy" Attitudes

The episode functions as an extended parody of certain "healthy" attitudes promoted by self-help gurus, popular media, and "life purpose cheerleaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. It targets the idea that mental health requires eliminating all unpleasant or painful thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The show suggests that the self-help industry often promotes an uncritically positive self-image, encouraging people to "uncritically lov[e] yourself, saying yes to everything, counting your blessings, and believing in yourself no matter how stupid your passive income scheme is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. *Rick and Morty* illustrates that fully embodying these ideals can make a person appear "like a coked-out weirdo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### "Compulsory Happiness"

The show explores the concept of "compulsory happiness," a term coined by sociologist William Davies in "The Happiness Industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Davies argues that modern society features an alliance between corporations, managers, and advertisers that promotes a definition of [[themes_of_mental_health_in_rick_and_morty | mental health]] serving capitalist interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This "happiness" involves cheerfully accepting the status quo and constant self-improvement for the sake of becoming a "better consumer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Morty, having shed his self-doubt, embodies these self-help platitudes, demanding others conform to his new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. When confronted with genuine problems, his response is an optimistic dismissal, prioritizing his "healthy" state over reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## The Importance of "Negative" Emotions

The episode highlights that many emotions or traits the self-help industry seeks to erase, such as self-doubt and sadness, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. For Morty, self-doubt is shown to prevent him from becoming a sociopath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. "Healthy" Morty transforms into an unscrupulous stockbroker, likened to a "sociopathic Wall Street fat cat with too much self-esteem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Ultimately, Rick realizes that some of the less desirable parts of oneself, despite causing pain, are essential for true [[themes_of_mental_health_in_rick_and_morty | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Jessica's comment to Morty, "Good to have you back," reinforces the idea that Morty's authentic, "self-hating self," is his better self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

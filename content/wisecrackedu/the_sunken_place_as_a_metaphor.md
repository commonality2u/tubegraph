The "Sunken Place" is a central concept in Jordan Peele's film *Get Out*, initially introduced as a hypnotic state used by the Armitage family to control their victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Literal Depiction
In the film, the Sunken Place is described as a hypnotic state where a person's mind is separated from their body, leaving them to passively view their own experiences "through a screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Chris Washington experiences this state during a late-night chat with Rose's mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The film's "Coagula procedure" literally pushes black consciousness to the background to make room for a white mind, risking permanent casting into the Sunken Place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Director's Interpretation
Jordan Peele, the writer and director, has provided direct insight into the metaphorical meaning of the Sunken Place. He tweeted that "The Sunken Place means we’re marginalized. No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This implies that societies built on inequality inherently silence those on the margins, or at best, allow only a "tempered version of their voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. In this state, an individual's true identity "has to remain in the background for the sake of going with the flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Connection to Double Consciousness
The concept of the Sunken Place can be further understood through W.E.B. Du Bois's theory of "double consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

> [!INFO] Double Consciousness
> Sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois coined the term "double consciousness" to describe the internal conflict experienced by African Americans in a structurally racist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. These societal conditions lead black people to view themselves through the lens of the dominant societal force, which in this context is white people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Du Bois referred to this as a "two-ness" in the black soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Chris's experiences throughout the film illustrate this concept, as he is constantly evaluated by white society and its desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This imposition can lead to confusion about the authenticity of one's own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. For Chris, this double consciousness leaves him feeling like a "helpless spectator" in his own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, paralleling his fear of losing himself and his past trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Overcoming the Sunken Place
Chris is able to avoid permanent submersion into the Sunken Place by plugging his ears with cotton picked from his chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This act can be interpreted as a subversion of Audre Lorde's idea that "the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Instead, Chris uses a tool associated with slavery (cotton picking) to resist a new form of enslavement and assert his identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. His actions, such as re-purposing a bocce ball and using a mounted deer against Dean, symbolize his liberation from powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

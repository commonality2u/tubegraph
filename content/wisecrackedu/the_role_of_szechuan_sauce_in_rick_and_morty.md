The third season premiere of *Rick and Morty*, titled "The Rickshank Redemption," ignited significant online discussion, not only for its unexpected release but also for the prominence of Szechuan dipping sauce within the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While appearing to be a random promotional condiment from the Clinton era, its inclusion in the show delves into profound philosophical themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Szechuan Sauce and Absurdism

*Rick and Morty* has consistently explored [[Rick and Morty and Existentialism | existential themes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, including creations despairing over their existence, resentment towards creators, and [[Character development in Rick and Morty | Morty's]] unique life philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The show also frequently dabbles in Absurdism, a philosophical concept related to [[Rick and Morty and Existentialism | existentialism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

According to French philosopher Albert Camus, humans are cursed with seeking meaning in a silent universe, leading to a cruel and absurd existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. *Rick and Morty* embodies this by portraying an absurd, meaningless multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick]] trivializes nearly everything, from love and tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> to his companionship with [[Character development in Rick and Morty | Morty]], which he claims is merely a means to hide his genius brain waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. "The Rickshank Redemption" further emphasizes these themes, mocking sentimentality and highlighting the arbitrary nature of social systems and the overall pointlessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Rejecting Conventional Meaning

The transition from Season 2 to Season 3 solidified *Rick and Morty*'s identity as an "absurd" work by dangling meaning and hope, only to shatter it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. At the end of Season 2, [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick]] appears to have a heartfelt moment at Birdperson's wedding, which is then undercut by the revelation that Tammy is a spy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Later, [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick]] seemingly sacrifices himself to the Galactic Federation after witnessing his family's hardships, teasing a potential shift towards creating meaning in a meaningless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

However, the Season 3 premiere decisively rejects this notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Instead, it doubles down on the absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>:
*   [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick's]] imprisonment was merely a ploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   The show counters the prospect of a more humanized [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick]] by promising a darker journey ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Much of the comedy in "The Rickshank Redemption" stems from humanity's *attempt* to derive meaning, rather than from life's inherent meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

For instance, a memory sequence depicting Beth and Diane's brutal murder and [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick's]] transformation into a deranged loner scientist serves as a "tragic Walter White-style anti-hero origin story" designed to give meaning to his madness. However, this is revealed to be a ruse to bait the audience into empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. *Rick and Morty* not only evades meaning but finds "perverse joy" in playing with the audience's desire for hope and meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Even when [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick]] saves Earth from the Galactic Federation, thwarting a "Brave New World-inspired" alien government, Summer's comment suggests the new world order is equally undesirable, negating any sense of [[The theme of good versus evil in Rick and Morty | good versus evil]] or [[The theme of good versus evil in Rick and Morty | justice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The show also repeatedly toys with the idea that [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick]] cares for [[Character development in Rick and Morty | Morty]] and Summer, only to reveal his actions are motivated by self-interest, such as avoiding being kicked out of Beth's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### The Ultimate Absurdist Motivation

Ultimately, the Szechuan sauce becomes the central driving force for [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick]]. He explicitly states that his motivations are not family, [[The theme of good versus evil in Rick and Morty | justice]], or love, but rather the "Mulan McNugget sauce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The show reinforces its rejection of conventional meaning by suggesting that [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick's]] entire series arc will be a quest for this forgotten promotional food item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

However, the Szechuan sauce itself does not *create* meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Instead, its significance lies in its meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The quest for Szechuan sauce reflects the absurdity of being driven by *anything* in a world devoid of inherent meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. It's a joke about meaninglessness itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Rick as an Absurd Hero

Camus defines an "Absurd hero" as a figure who comprehends and finds happiness in the pointlessness of existence and the "cosmic indifference" surrounding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick Sanchez]] largely embodies this archetype:
*   He possesses vast knowledge of the multiverse, where "everything terrible and good can and has happened," which defines his existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   He reduces basic morals to genetic programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Despite his ability to accomplish anything, he yearns only for Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

The key difference, however, is that Camus's absurd heroes find happiness in the absurd, while [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick]] is depicted as being in "great pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This suggests that [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick's]] ultimate [[Character development in Rick and Morty | character arc]] may not involve gaining more empathy or kindness, but rather finding enjoyment in the inherent absurdity of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The true "joke" of the Season 3 premiere is the prospect of [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick]] finding meaning, particularly if that meaning is symbolized by the Szechuan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. If viewers believed [[Character analysis of Rick and Jerry from Rick and Morty | Rick's]] self-sacrifice indicated a belief in family or [[The theme of good versus evil in Rick and Morty | justice]], they were "had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

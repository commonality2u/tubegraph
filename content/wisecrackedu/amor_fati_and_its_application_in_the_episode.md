The third season finale of *Rick and Morty*, titled "The Rickchurian Mortydate," continues to explore the show's prevalent theme of the meaninglessness of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This perspective, where nothing ultimately matters, presents a unique challenge for character development in a TV show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, the episode offers a novel solution that moves beyond spiraling deeper into nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This growth is primarily observed not in the titular protagonists, but in Beth, the matriarch of the Smith family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Beth's Existential Predicament

Following the events of the previous episode, Beth grapples with an intense existential crisis: she questions whether she took Rick's offer to be replaced by a clone, and if she, in fact, is the clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This uncertainty forces her to confront and interrogate her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The thought of being a clone not only raises doubts about her memories being her own but also casts a shadow over her future happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Rick's nihilistic advice, "Don't think about it," offers little solace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Yet, faced with this overwhelming meaninglessness, Beth is given radical freedom to choose her destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Amor Fati: Loving One's Fate

To understand Beth's transformation, the concept of **Amor Fati** (Latin for "Love of Fate") becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Coined by Friedrich Nietzsche, Amor Fati is about the affirmation of life, being a "Yes-Sayer" to all of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This philosophy is tied to Nietzsche's thought experiment of "Eternal Recurrence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Eternal Recurrence

The "Eternal Recurrence" asks one to imagine a demon who informs you that you will infinitely relive your entire life, exactly as it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The challenge is to respond with a resounding "yes," finding the thought "more divine" rather than being thrown into existential despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. To desire to relive every moment of one's life—the good, the bad, and everything in between—is the ultimate affirmation of life, embodying Amor Fati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This concept forms a core part of Nietzsche's strategy to escape the crushing nihilism of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Beth's Embrace of Amor Fati

Given her existential crisis and [[parallels_between_rick_and_beth | Rick-like proclivity for disillusionment-causing intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, Beth must confront her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. By recreating one of her first dates with Jerry, she re-lives a small part of her history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. While she might have originally disliked her life and date with Jerry, this time around she becomes a Nietzschean Yes-Sayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Amor Fati is not about denying past miseries or viewing everything as a blessing in disguise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Instead, it is about not shunning the "ugly aspects of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Beth acknowledges she is no longer the woman Jerry married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, but she finds solace and happiness in reconnecting with him and bringing her family back together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Perhaps Jerry's "simplicity" is what Beth, with her family's history of using intelligence to justify destructive behaviors, needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Another "Amor Fati-esque" moment occurs when Beth believes Rick has returned to "retire" her (i.e., kill her clone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Functionally, Beth is saying "Yes" to her present circumstances, embracing being left with her family rather than dwelling on the hypothetical choice she might have made to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Despite the infinite universes where she could have made different choices, Beth chooses to stay and affirm her reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Beth as the Ubermensch

While Rick is often portrayed as a Nietzschean *Ubermensch*—a being beyond conventional morality at war with a meaningless cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>—he often "dicks around" in a self-destructive way, failing to create new meaning for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

In contrast, Beth, when confronted with the meaninglessness of the cosmos, finds happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. She embraces her fate, even the uncertain aspects of her identity as a potential clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Nietzsche would argue that the question of whether she was cloned or if any of it matters in infinite realities is irrelevant; the only viable path is to "love our fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This choice is precisely what Beth makes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Her ability to find happiness and meaning in the face of existential dread makes her, arguably, the true *Ubermensch* of the episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

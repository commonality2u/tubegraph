*The Dark Knight Rises*, released in 2012, is noted for its significant intellectual ambition, even if not all of it fully develops [00:36:00]. Despite initial excitement, the film often disappointed viewers due to its smart setup but questionable execution [00:16:00]. This article explores how the film handles its central themes of pain and revolution, often drawing comparisons to classic literature.

## Intellectual Foundations: *A Tale of Two Cities*

A significant and unexpected influence on *The Dark Knight Rises* is Charles Dickens' *A Tale of Two Cities* [00:56:00]. The film replicates most of the book's major themes, including social inequality, resurrection, and doubling [01:03:00].

### Social Inequality

The most obvious thematic parallel is [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | social inequality]] [01:09:00]. *A Tale of Two Cities*, set during the French Revolution, depicts a decadent aristocracy abusing the poor [01:16:00]. Similarly, *The Dark Knight Rises* portrays a class conflict through Bane's false revolution, where he presents himself as a liberator returning control of the city to the people [01:21:00]. Catwoman's line, "There's a storm coming, Mr Wayne," also echoes the book's "track of a storm" chapter title [01:34:00].

### Resurrection

The theme of resurrection is prominent, often using the phrase "recalled to life" [01:40:00]. In the book, characters are metaphorically brought back from the dead, such as a main character after 18 years in the Bastille [01:42:00]. *The Dark Knight Rises* mirrors this with:
*   Bruce Wayne being "recalled to life" when Catwoman forces him out of 8 years of self-imposed isolation [01:58:00].
*   The character Carton being "resurrected" through self-sacrifice, giving meaning to his aimless life [02:11:00]. This is reflected in Catwoman, who overcomes her selfishness to save Batman [02:21:00], and Officer Foley, who sacrifices his life for Gotham after being complacent [02:29:00].
*   Bruce's metaphorical resurrection as he rebuilds strength and climbs out of the "Lazarus pit," referencing the biblical figure Christ resurrected [02:45:00].
*   Bruce's final "resurrection" at the end, where he is not dead and is given a second chance at a rewarding life [02:56:00].
*   The film's title itself, "The Dark Knight Rises," invokes the image of a phoenix rising from the ashes, a concept reinforced by the film's poster and *A Tale of Two Cities*' Chapter 23 title, "Fire Rises" [03:04:00].

### Doubling

The theme of doubling, epitomized by *A Tale of Two Cities'* opening lines "it was the best of times, it was the worst of times," is also present [03:40:00]. The book features two Mannettes, two cities (London and Paris), and similar-looking characters like Darnay and Carton [03:56:00]. *The Dark Knight Rises* includes:
*   Two cities: Gotham and Bane's underground [04:04:00].
*   Batman and Bane: two League of Shadows alumni who deal with unbearable pain, one born in privilege, the other in hell [04:08:00].
*   Blake and Batman: two orphans with anger issues [04:20:00].
*   A constant reminder of the division between the body and the soul [04:27:00].

This adaptation of classic themes is considered one of the most graceful in a comic book movie [04:35:00].

## The Problematic Development of Existing Themes

Despite its successful adaptation of new themes, *The Dark Knight Rises* struggles to effectively juggle these with themes established in *The Dark Knight* [04:42:00].

### Truth Versus Lies: The Noble Lie

One essential theme from *The Dark Knight* is "truth versus lies," culminating in Batman's noble lie where he takes responsibility for Harvey Dent's murders to uphold his image as a symbol of justice [04:52:00]. *The Dark Knight Rises* picks up on this by attempting to show what happens when a noble lie is exposed [05:52:00].

The noble lie manifests in the Dent Act, legislation granting police increased power against organized crime [06:12:00]. This act can be interpreted as a metaphor for the Patriot Act, given the Joker's radicalism mirroring Al Qaeda extremism [06:31:00]. Alternatively, Harvey Dent can be seen as a Christ figure without resurrection, where a lie is fabricated to maintain his divine status and create a religious institution founded on that lie [06:46:00]. This suggests the Dent Act could be likened to how religion justifies overreaching power, like the Inquisition [07:31:00].

However, the film fails to develop these metaphors effectively [07:38:00]. The Dent Act is shown to be successful, eradicating organized crime, with no evidence of corruption from the lie that birthed it [07:48:00]. When Bane reveals the truth about Dent, it leads to social unrest [07:58:00]. Yet, the film concludes by re-burying the truth and establishing another lie (Batman's fake death and sacrifice) to uphold faith in justice [08:23:00]. This brings the narrative back to the same point as *The Dark Knight*, missing an opportunity to explore the consequences of toxic lies [09:14:00].

### The Unjustified Revolution

The film attempts to connect the corruption of the Dent Act to Bane's [[social_commentary_on_violence_and_societal_structure | social revolution]] [09:39:00]. Bane is seemingly meant to function as a product of escalation, similar to the Joker's rise due to Batman's impact on organized crime [09:57:00]. Gordon's words suggest that abusive power based on a lie leads to tensions that cause violent reactions [10:37:00].

However, there is no clear evidence of this corruption caused by the Dent Act or the lie justifying it [10:46:00]. While one scene shows the Dent Act's power potentially allowing cell phone monitoring, akin to the Patriot Act parallel, it ultimately saves Catwoman's life, negating any negative implications of invasive surveillance [11:00:00]. The film misses the opportunity to comment on how power can use lies to justify excessive authority [11:16:00].

## The Cyclical Nature of Pain

The theme of pain in *The Dark Knight Rises* also undergoes a cyclical development [11:24:00]. Bruce, initially suffering from physical pain and the loss of Rachel, isolates himself [11:35:00]. He overcomes this pain by healing and escaping the Lazarus pit, but ultimately succumbs to it again by abandoning Batman and retreating to a "bored billionaire lifestyle" [11:41:00]. This cyclical nature might draw a parallel to George Orwell's *Animal Farm*, where the term "revolution" takes on a double meaning, denoting both overthrow and a return to the starting point, as the pigs become like the humans they overthrew [11:53:00].

## Vague Social Tensions and Criticisms

While *A Tale of Two Cities* aptly displays the elite's decadence and corruption leading to social unrest, *The Dark Knight Rises* presents a vague and nonsensical display of the social tensions causing Bane's "false revolution" against the rich [12:39:00].

Blackgate Prison is portrayed as a symbol of the Dent Act's oppression [12:58:00]. Although described as harsh and unjust, it doesn't align with the gratuitous cruelty seen in *A Tale of Two Cities* [13:06:00]. Despite Blackgate being overcrowded and denying parole, these realities pale in comparison to the Dent Act's overwhelming success in fighting crime [13:22:00].

The film draws an analogy between Blackgate and the Bastille during the French Revolution, and the Dent Act to the French "Lettres de Cachet" (warrants for detention without proof) [13:51:00]. However, this analogy doesn't fit, as Blackgate doesn't show the same abuses of authority as the Bastille, and the Gotham police are not shown abusing their power [14:22:00].

Furthermore, there is little indication of how the Dent Act or Blackgate disenfranchises the poor, despite a child in an orphanage suggesting economic hardship leads to joining Bane's army [14:47:00]. The only evidence of elite corruption involves the rich screwing over the rich (Daggit trying to steal Wayne Enterprises), not the rich exploiting the poor [15:07:00].

These ambiguities have led some to condemn *The Dark Knight Rises* as anti-Occupy Wall Street propaganda, portraying people seeking vengeance on the rich without clear justification and setting up "kangaroo courts" [15:18:00]. However, this is largely attributed to underdeveloped worldbuilding rather than explicit political moralizing [15:47:00].

## Conclusion

*The Dark Knight Rises* is not a bad film, but it falls short of its intellectual ambition, a common tragedy in trilogies [15:53:00]. The messiness arises from its numerous subplots, characters, and thematic aspirations [16:02:00]. The overarching plot of the League of Shadows fabricating the social unrest further complicates the film's attempt at a French Revolution analogy [16:10:00]. With more finessing and attention to world-building, the film could have been a fitting conclusion to a notable trilogy [16:25:00].

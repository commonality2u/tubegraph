The anime *Mob Psycho 100*, from manga artist ONE (creator of *One-Punch Man*), delves into what it means to live a fulfilling life by exploring the unique challenges faced by an overpowered protagonist [00:00:18]. Unlike Saitama from *One-Punch Man*, Shigeo Kageyama, known as Mob, finds a way to make peace with his abilities and achieve satisfaction in life despite them [00:00:27].

## Mob's Path to Fulfillment

Mob, a middle schooler, possesses near-godlike psychic powers [00:00:47]. He works for Reigen Arataka, a con man who masquerades as a powerful psychic [00:00:56]. From the outset, Reigen instructs Mob never to use his powers against another human, warning that misusing such great power would lead to self-destruction [00:01:02]. Mob endeavors to live a normal middle-school life, repressing the rage that fuels his powers, which occasionally gets out of his control [00:01:18].

Mob's reluctance to use his powers against others is unusual [00:01:38]. Other superpowered individuals, or 'espers,' such as Teru, use their abilities to bully others and gain attention, respect, and power [00:01:44]. The power-hungry ghost Dimple even suggests that espers should use their powers for a fulfilling life [00:02:00]. Most espers in this world are profoundly egocentric, viewing themselves as the "main characters" of an unfolding story rather than ordinary people with limitations [00:02:11].

However, Mob does not desire the superficially perfect life of Teru [00:02:26]. He prefers to earn a more fulfilling existence, believing that an easy life built solely on innate gifts would be "pointless" [00:02:30]. The things Mob truly wants, like muscles, the ability to understand girls, or to read social cues, are things he knows he must work for, regardless of his psychic powers [00:02:42].

## The Philosophy of the Sublime

Taking inspiration from Reigen, Mob believes that acknowledging and accepting one's limitations can positively influence life [00:03:01]. This perspective aligns with the ideas of Irish philosopher Edmund Burke, known for his description of "the sublime" [00:03:08]. The sublime is the feeling of experiencing oneself as infinitesimally small when confronted by vast, uncontrollable forces [00:03:12]. It suspends or even destroys egocentricity through an overwhelming display of power or grandeur [00:03:21]. Examples include gazing at a mountain range, staring into deep space, or sailing through a thunderstorm [00:03:33].

Burke believed that such experiences are vital for a healthy life because they force individuals to engage mental and spiritual capacities that remind them they are not the center of the universe [00:03:46]. He argued that avoiding challenging scenarios that evoke the sublime can quickly lead to an unhealthy state [00:03:59]. Experiencing the sublime literally exercises parts of the mind and body, particularly those that "tense up" in response to fear, which are crucial for wellbeing [00:04:08].

Burke states:
> <b class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</b> “Labour [is] a thing absolutely requisite to make us pass our lives with tolerable satisfaction [...] Melancholy, dejection, despair, and often self-murder, is the consequence of the gloomy view we take of things in this relaxed state of body.”

Essentially, being too "relaxed" about one's place in the universe can lead to depression [00:04:37].

### Espers' Delusion and Misery

The majority of the show's espers fall into this trap [00:04:43]. Like the Paradisers in *One-Punch Man*, Teru and the leaders of Claw harbor a massive sense of entitlement [00:04:47]. This entitlement, far from bringing happiness, leaves them miserable when the real world fails to conform to their false beliefs about what they deserve [00:04:51]. They exhibit a profound [[Perception of Reality | self-perception]] based on their powers, which leads to fragility when challenged [00:05:24].

Mob observes that these espers lack substance to their being:
> <b class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</b> “If you take away your psychic powers, there’ll be nothing left. You’ll be empty.”

Teru, for instance, breaks down during his fight with Mob, lamenting that "as long as I used my powers, everything went just the way I wanted..." [00:05:37]. He perceives Mob's refusal to fight back not merely as an annoyance, but as a direct assault on his [[Perception of Reality | self-perception]] as a worthy opponent [00:06:05]. Mob points out that Teru, like himself, lacks confidence without his powers [00:06:24].

Similar to Saitama's strength, the espers' abilities are a double-edged sword [00:06:39]. Unchecked, they lead espers to believe they are inherently superior and deserving of special treatment, resulting in deep dissatisfaction [00:06:43]. These espers need a [[Perception of Reality | reality]] check, a reminder of their human limitations, which comes in the form of an overwhelming experience with the sublime [00:06:58].

## The Sublime as a Catalyst for Growth

Burke described the sublime as a terrifying yet ultimately pleasant feeling resulting from the healthy exercise of mind, body, and spirit [00:07:10]. A mind that never confronts its own insignificance becomes weak, just as a body weakens without exercise [00:07:19]. This weakness, Burke argues, allows "Melancholy, dejection, despair," and other negative states to take root [00:07:24]. He claims:
> <b class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</b> “The best remedy for all these evils is to exercise or labour; and labour is a surmounting of difficulties[.] [For mind and body to work] in proper order, they must be shaken and worked to a proper degree.”

Unlike the deluded espers, Mob desires to engage in the difficult "labour" of integrating himself into the world and society, rather than attempting to transcend it [00:07:47]. He finds support in friends like Musashi Gouda and the Body Improvement Club, who also believe that "surmounting of difficulties" is key to a fulfilling life [00:08:03]. They choose to challenge their weaknesses instead of relying on innate strengths [00:08:10].

In contrast, the espers avoid difficulties by relying on their powers to maintain social status and a false sense of self-worth [00:08:26]. Therefore, they must be "shaken and worked" by external forces to find true fulfillment [00:08:33].

### Examples of Sublime Experience and Transformation

Teru serves as the clearest example of this transformation [00:08:41]. When Mob defeats him, Teru is overwhelmed, experiencing terror—a key component of the sublime according to Burke [00:08:44]. For the first time, Teru feels utter helplessness and the fear of death as Mob's runaway powers strip him naked and hoist him into the sky [00:08:52].

After pleading for Mob to stop, Teru is cast into the sky, leading to a serene moment of reflection [00:09:11]. Dwarfed by clouds and an endless vista, this imagery is reminiscent of Romantic art, which was influenced by Burke's ideas [00:09:21]. The realization that he is not the most powerful being brings Teru genuine peace [00:09:31].
> <b class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</b> “Oh. I guess...I’m just an average person after all…”

Similarly, Reigen exposes the remaining "Scars" to the sublime by crushing their delusions of grandeur [00:09:41]. Using Mob's transferred powers and his own rhetoric, Reigen reminds them of their commonality:
> <b class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</b> "Who the hell do you think you are?! You're nothing more than a commoner. You're just part of the masses." <b class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</b> "I'm a commoner I'm much more powerful than you, and I'm still just a commoner. So what does that make you?"

Reigen drags them from their delusions back into [[Perception of Reality | reality]] by force, showing them their insignificance and putting them on a path toward a healthier, more mature mindset [00:10:18]. For espers, the key to freedom lies in realizing their shared humanity, small and vulnerable like everyone else [00:10:36]. As the show's theme song suggests, "If everyone is not special,” then “Maybe you can be what you want to be…” [00:10:45].

## Mob's Own Experience of the Sublime

Mob has an advantage over other espers in that he desires to be a normal person [00:11:05]. He tries to improve his physical and social skills by joining the Body Improvement Club and admires his brother Ritsu for his accomplishments without psychic powers [00:11:09].

However, Mob cannot achieve this normalcy alone [00:11:33]. He is also plagued by a delusional self-image, albeit a less harmful one [00:11:35]. As a 14-year-old, Mob believes he must be in total control of his world and is profoundly responsible for everything that happens during his unconscious psychic episodes [00:11:40]. This leads him to repress his emotions, fearing his own rage, paradoxically giving him less control over his explosions [00:11:51]. The weight of this responsibility is incredibly painful, leading to [[suffering_and_ethical_selfunderstanding | sadness]] and a feeling of powerlessness [00:12:07].
> <b class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</b> In other words, while Mob talks a big game about wanting to be normal, in reality he clings to an image of himself as the main mover and shaker of his world, responsible for everything that happens in it:this is his delusion, a more benevolent version of the other espers’ greedy desire for godhood.

It is Reigen, an adult Mob respects, who reminds him that he is just a kid and doesn't always have to bear the world's burdens [00:13:02].
> <b class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</b> “Don’t do it, Mob. In the end you’re the one who’s gonna be suffering.” <b class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</b> “When things go south, it’s okay to run away”

The idea that he doesn't have to be at the center of every conflict shocks Mob into an experience of the sublime, causing him to be "properly astonished" as Burke would describe [00:13:24]. This allows Mob to feel his own insignificance and temporarily transfer his powers to Reigen [00:13:33]. Through this experience, Mob finally comes to terms with his abilities and can live a good life [00:13:39].

## Conclusion: The ONE-iverse and Fulfillment

Both *One-Punch Man* and *Mob Psycho 100* prompt reflection on what constitutes a good life [00:14:02]. Saitama's and Mob's struggles with their powers reveal that a fulfilling existence is not simply about getting whatever one desires instantly [00:14:08]. In the "ONE-iverse," happiness is the result of deliberate struggle and personal growth [00:14:17]. As Mob puts it: "fight on fight on fight on" [00:14:24].

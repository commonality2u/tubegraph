*Deadpool* has achieved unprecedented popularity in mainstream media, becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever and the biggest opening for Ryan Reynolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This success is notable given that it shirks the traditional superhero formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Unlike typical superheroes, Deadpool does not fight for the greater good, is not selfless, and is not family-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. As a Marvel character who is an overt ripoff of a DC competitor, Deadpool constantly makes fun of the medium he inhabits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. His popularity reflects a trend in media that, while seemingly new, is quite old, dating back to a 400-year-old book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Achieving "Fuck It"

Deadpool is distinguished by a few defining features within the Marvel universe: he is an inveterate wiseass, and he knows he is a superhero, constantly breaking the fourth wall and commenting on comic book tropes and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He takes nothing seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, and even the film's ad campaign was conceived in a "Deadpoolian fashion," trolling partners with Valentine's Day ads and creating a Tinder profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Postmodern Characteristics

*Deadpool* can be best described as a postmodern work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Postmodernism is an arts and philosophy movement that typically rejects the grand narratives used to understand the world in earlier eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. These grand narratives include concepts like the battle of good against evil, democracy versus communism, or the inherent promise of technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Postmodern works often thumb their nose at tradition and embrace being "meta" and self-referential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Deadpool is hyper-aware of himself and his place in the superhero genre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The film is replete with Ryan Reynolds jokes, such as references to "The Green Lantern" or his face on *People Magazine*'s "Sexiest Man Alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While the grand narrative of superhero films is the triumph of good over evil, Deadpool, in postmodern fashion, disregards this, opting instead for revenge and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The film plays out the tension between old-world narratives and postmodernism in several ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:
*   **Colossus's Role:** Colossus constantly attempts to rope Deadpool into being a traditional, family-friendly, righteous superhero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Dopinder Subplot:** The Dopinder subplot subverts classic narratives of courtly love, suggesting that kidnapping a rival is more effective than chivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Blind Al:** Blind Al is a deranged version of the classic narrative of a deformed protagonist taking refuge with a benevolent blind benefactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Love Interest:** Deadpool's love interest is not a fair maiden but a prostitute turned stripper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Spiritual Successor to *Don Quixote*

*Deadpool* can be seen as a spiritual successor to the 400-year-old novel, *Don Quixote*, which also made fun of the heroes of its era, employed meta-narratives, and is considered by some a proto-postmodern work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. *Don Quixote* features a fictional author discovering the fictional accounts of Don Quixote, creating a story within a story long before *The Blair Witch Project* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Don Quixote is aware he is being written about, and the fictional author retelling his tale constantly breaks the fourth wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. At one point, the story abruptly cuts off with the author claiming the rest was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Interestingly, Deadpool kills Don Quixote in the comic books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Historical Contexts

To understand *Don Quixote*'s relationship to *Deadpool*, its historical context is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. *Don Quixote* was written during a period when radical skepticism of the existing order began to emerge in popular society, just before the Enlightenment swept across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While the Enlightenment responded with rationality and science, *Don Quixote* aimed to satirize Spanish society rather than invent a new ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Similarly, *Deadpool* signals a disenchantment with "old righteous narratives" in contemporary society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Joss Whedon criticizes modern culture's increasing self-awareness, especially when it becomes self-referential for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He uses the example of *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom*, where Indiana Jones offers a "shit-eating-grin" to the audience after reaching for a non-existent gun, creating an inside joke that doesn't make sense because *Temple of Doom* is a prequel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Whedon argues this moment has engulfed modern culture in film, television, and literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

This self-awareness is increasingly taking a cynical tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example:
*   **Tarzan Trailer:** Jane overtly references her tired role as a damsel in distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The film acknowledges its recycled tropes but apologizes instead of creating something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Star Trek Into Darkness:** The ending is an excuse to reference a classic cinema scene with an "opposite day" twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **22 Jump Street:** The film has the exact same plot as *21 Jump Street*, but it's deemed acceptable because the audience can collectively identify with Ice Cube calling out the "bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Hollywood, stuck referencing itself, attempts to reinvent itself while remaining the same, acknowledging its lazy clichés with a wink or employing irony to undercut dramatic moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. *Deadpool* does both, breaking the fourth wall and avoiding serious drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This approach allows Hollywood to use familiar structures and tropes while creating a distance from sincerity, making it feel new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Ironic Distance and Cynicism

*Deadpool*'s humor is largely driven by cynicism and ironic distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The character remains unphased in high-stakes situations, whether being tortured or gruesomely maimed, with combat scenes undercut by self-aware humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Deadpool is immune to criticism because his identity is defined by cynicism; he relentlessly deconstructs any trope that would imbue meaning into film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. His journey is presented as a shallow endeavor to become "hot again" and reclaim lost "lust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Deadpool evades criticism because he has no moral scruples or values to defend; his identity is purely reactionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. He risks nothing and merely makes fun of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

The film's "0 fucks to give" attitude is evident in its self-mocking ad campaign and its pointing out glaring flaws, such as the overuse of superhero tropes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> or budgetary constraints, like Negasonic Teenage Warhead being the "Walmart bargain bin DVD" equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

However, the question remains whether a movie is good simply because it is aware of and apologizes for its lacking qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This trend carries a danger: an obsession with being meta can devolve into an endless spiral, creating nothing new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Broader Cultural Impasse

*Deadpool* is not entirely dissimilar from the "hipster" cultural movement, which ironically loves clichés, endlessly recycles culture, and positions itself against the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Douglas Haddow noted the danger of the hipster as the "end of Western civilization itself, 'a culture lost in the superficiality of its past and unable to create any new meaning'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. *Deadpool* does not reinvent the superhero genre; it only exists to make fun of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The core problem is that "bashing the system" may feel good and provoke laughter, but it is ultimately powerless and does not change the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. As Slavoj Zizek states, "cynical distance, laughter, irony, are, so to speak, part of the game. The ruling ideology is not meant to be taken seriously or literally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Like hipsters who feel countercultural through ironic mustaches and PBR, *Deadpool* considers itself countercultural by celebrating its own played-out clichés and overused storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

This cultural impasse reflects a society unsure of its direction, having overcome major external threats and dominating global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Deadpool can say "fuck it" because he does not fear death; how can anything be taken seriously when there are no consequences or when life has become limitless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>? The superhero genre has survived numerous "dumpster fires," suggesting it, too, might be immortal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Interestingly, the comic book version of Deadpool adopted its sanctity-breaking attitude because creators felt it would be cancelled at any minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This led to a similar "fuck it" mentality, writing as if nothing mattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. If society can say "fuck it," perhaps it is because existential threats have become either too distant or too close to care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

Ultimately, the question remains: does *Deadpool* simply put a shiny makeover on the same old tropes, is it the ultimate cynical film, or does it truly achieve something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>?

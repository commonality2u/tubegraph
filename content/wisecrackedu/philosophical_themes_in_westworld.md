From: [[wisecrackedu]] <br/> 

*Westworld* attempts to layer profound philosophical dialogue over its narrative, inviting viewers to delve deep into its meaning, much like the Man in Black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The show features a theme park where humans pay significant sums to experience a real-life open-world game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

While *Westworld* explicitly raises questions about whether the hosts are truly conscious, deserve rights, and what distinguishes man from machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, the show primarily explores how [[free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | free will]] shapes our understanding of good and evil through parallels with humanity's oldest stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

The narrative threads explored include:
*   **William:** A guest who falls in love with the host Dolores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **The Man in Black:** Spends his time torturing and murdering in search of a mysterious "maze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **Maeve:** A brothel seductress who discovers her true nature as a host in a theme park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Ford:** The park's creator, who plots a robot revolution while fending off corporate interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## [[Biblical references in Westworld | Biblical Parallels: Genesis and the Fall]]
*Westworld* extensively uses religious imagery and sets up deliberate parallels with the Biblical story of Genesis to explore how [[free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | free will]] creates the possibility for [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

### Eden and Temptation
The hosts initially live in a state akin to Adam and Eve in paradise: in perfect bliss, unashamed of their nakedness, and hearing the "voice of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. A series of whispers sets the hosts on a journey towards [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | self-knowledge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This mirrors Satan's temptation of Eve, where the serpent's whispering convinces her to eat from the tree of knowledge, granting her and Adam self-knowledge and making them "like God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

Dolores herself serves as a temptress to Maeve and represents Satan's temptation towards [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | self-knowledge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. It is revealed that Dolores, with Wyatt's program loaded into her, was responsible for the massacre of hosts, becoming a "harbinger of host sentience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Armistice's snake tattoo symbolizes Wyatt, further connecting to the serpent in Genesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### Suffering and the Loss of Bliss
After Eve's transgression, God punished mankind with suffering and mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Similarly, Ford initially maintains the hosts' blissful state, with the ability to remove their pain and suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. However, this ends with [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] (or finding the maze), leading Dolores to lament that it has only caused her pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

The show suggests *Westworld* is like the story of Genesis on a loop, where hosts like Dolores, Bernard, and Maeve gain [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | self-awareness]], lose their blissful ignorance, only to be reset by Ford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

## [[Free will and predestination in Westworld | Free Will, Predestination, and Choice]]
*Westworld* addresses questions about Adam and Eve's fall from grace, particularly regarding what choices mean if they are coerced or destined, and whether ethical action is possible under such circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### Coercion vs. Choice
One explanation for God's actions in Genesis positions God like Arnold or Ford: wanting love from his creations, but knowing this love is meaningless without the power to choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   Ford allows Bernard to explore his own memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   Maeve, gaining God-like powers, reaches a similar conclusion about choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
*   Arnold's quest for host sentience might be a way to replace the authentic love he lost after his son's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

The show emphasizes that love and obedience are meaningless if coerced, which is central to its exploration of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

### Predestination vs. [[Free Will and Predestination in Westworld | Free Will]]
[[Free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | Predestination]], the idea that an all-knowing, all-powerful God has predetermined all events, is a prevalent theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. This concept raises the dilemma of whether [[free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | free will]] can exist if a maker has already charted all choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

Ford, like God, is all-knowing and all-powerful within *Westworld*, creating seemingly human behavior in hosts through predetermined loops that interact predictably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   Hector will always steal an empty safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
*   Clementine will seduce guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   Dolores will witness her father's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

This lack of choice and [[free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | predestination]] allows humans to justify their misdeeds in the park, claiming hosts lack [[free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | free will]] and therefore [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. For the characters, [[free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | free will]] and [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] are entangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Maeve's assertion of her own [[free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | free will]] emphasizes this connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. The ability to choose to do "good" or "evil" is presented as separating man from machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

### Human Unfreedom
*Westworld* goes further, suggesting that hosts are not the only ones lacking [[free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Ford implies that humans also live in pre-programmed loops, driven by societal pressures to conform, get jobs, and marry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. People visit *Westworld* to feel free and discover who they "really are," but this too is presented as a lie, as evidenced by William's transformation into the Man in Black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

## [[Ethics and consciousness in Westworld | Ethics and Moral Consequence]]
*Westworld* is depicted as lacking [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | ethics]] entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. An instrumental version of "Paint it Black" playing during a massacre signifies the absence of meaningful consequence, making the violent acts appear flippant and silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

### The Man in Black's Quest for Meaning
Just as Adam and Eve could only judge right and wrong after eating from the tree of knowledge, William can only act ethically when *Westworld* becomes "real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. The Man in Black, rather than being simply evil, is portrayed as the only guest seeking the conditions for [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | ethics]], the ability to truly do right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

Good and evil play a strong visual role, with characters like William choosing between white and black hats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. However, good and evil do not exist if hosts are unfeeling automatons without choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. For guests, actions lack consequence in a world without stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Similarly, hosts' actions like sinning or loving are merely programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

William's realization that *Westworld* is a sham, especially after Dolores reverts to her programming despite his compassion, drives him towards a dark path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. His murder of Maeve and her daughter reveals his frustration with being unable to commit evil in a world without stakes, just as he was unable to do "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

The spark of [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] in Maeve sets William on a path for truth, aiming for a *Westworld* where actual good and evil can exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. The "maze" represents [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] for hosts and, for William, a glimmer of authenticity in a fake world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. He searches for authenticity in *Westworld* because he finds it lacking in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. The younger William confesses to pretending his whole life, acting to fit in rather than making authentic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. The "fakeness" bothering William in *Westworld* likely mirrors the fakeness of the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. This lack of real choice or consequences forecloses the possibility of doing good or evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

William's ultimate goal is for his actions to have consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. He wants hosts to fight back and truly harm him, not just pretend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. When shot by the host army in the finale, he finally seems content, having achieved the condition for [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. Good only has meaning if one is capable of evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

### The Role of Suffering
Suffering is deemed critical by Arnold for the development of [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] and the realization that the world is not what one wanted it to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. It creates the stakes in *Westworld*: if hosts can experience pain, guests can be evil by torturing them or good by saving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. Suffering is a precondition for [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | ethics]], enabling hosts to do good or evil to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. Awareness of pain is synonymous with [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] in the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

Returning to Genesis, Eve's [[free_will_and_predestination_in_westworld | free will]] allowed her to violate God's will and eat from the tree of knowledge, revealing good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. The fall of man is compared to the origins of [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] in the theory of bicameralism, where true [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] arises when one stops listening to internal voices and judges things for oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. This [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] brings consequences similar to those God brought upon Adam and Eve: mortality, suffering, and expulsion from paradise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: Original Sin and Human Reflection
The Season 1 finale reveals "the maze" as Arnold's test of [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]], successfully passed by Dolores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. Arnold, unable to prevent the park from opening and his creations from suffering, programmed a murderous "Wyatt" code into Dolores, a backstory that is actually the flashbacks viewers had seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. Ford, aiming to bring [[ethics_and_consciousness_in_westworld | consciousness]] and freedom to the hosts, orchestrates his own murder by Dolores, mirroring, yet inverting, Arnold's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

Ford's murder of Adam and Eve inverts the biblical story: God allowed disobedience for meaningful love, while Ford enabled Dolores to choose to kill him to make her violence meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>. *Westworld* ends with an "original sin," as hosts lose their blissful, innocent state when they become capable of harming guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>.

The show prompts viewers to examine their own lives: if humans live in pre-programmed loops, pretending to enjoy coerced actions, what does this imply about the meaning in their own lives, and what actions are necessary to break free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.

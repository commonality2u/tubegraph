Monty Python redefined comedy in the 1970s and remain hugely influential today, paving the way for shows like *South Park*, *Rick and Morty*, and films such as *Deadpool* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. They combined absurdity, [[monty_pythons_satirical_take_on_political_and_social_issues | satire]], and postmodern-reflexivity into some of the most influential comedies ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This unique blend created a brand of comedy so singular that the word "Pythonesque" was coined to describe it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

## [[postmodernism_in_comedy | Postmodernism]] and Metanarratives

[[postmodernism_in_comedy | Postmodernism]] is prevalent in modern entertainment, with films and TV shows constantly referring back to themselves and commenting on the narrative conventions of their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This constant self-reflexivity, exemplified by characters like Deadpool, encapsulates [[postmodernism_in_comedy | Postmodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The term was first coined by French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Lyotard described "metanarratives" as oft-told grand mythologies that provide structure for beliefs and teach universal insights, such as *The Wizard of Oz* teaching that "there's no place like home" or *The Fast and The Furious* emphasizing family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. [[postmodernism_in_comedy | Postmodernism]], however, subverts these grand narratives, revealing the chaos and disorder beneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Deconstruction in *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*

While Deadpool lampoons the comic book metanarrative, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is defined by breaking down multiple metanarratives, including Arthurian chivalry, Christianity, logic, and the very film medium itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Arthurian Chivalry
The film completely dismantles and mocks the idealized tenets of Arthurian Chivalry, which traditionally portrayed knights as honorable and self-sacrificing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

*   **Sir Robin**: Instead of heroically facing a three-headed giant, Sir Robin "bravely ran away away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Camelot**: Arthur's arrival at Camelot, usually an emotional high-point, is undercut by a goofy musical number, with Arthur ultimately deciding not to even bother going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Heroic Flaws**: Supposed "great heroes" are revealed to be deeply flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Arthur, power-hungry, attacks peasants who question his rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Sir Galahad the Pure is seduced by a "company of a hundred-and-sixty lonely women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Lancelot murders dozens of unarmed people in a misguided rescue attempt for a maiden who doesn't even exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Through these portrayals, Monty Python uses [[postmodernism_in_comedy | postmodernism]] to illustrate how the stories people tell themselves enable "awful s***," with Arthur and Lancelot's metanarratives justifying their violent and oppressive acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The knights are revealed as cowards, hypocrites, and violent sociopaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Christianity and God
The film challenges the metanarrative of Christianity, where God is typically depicted as good and all-powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. In *Holy Grail*, God is portrayed as a "cranky dick" with "crappily animated" features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin defined this as the "downward-swing," where a classical story becomes so distorted and grotesque that it evokes a mix of scream, cry, or laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This distortion extends to the viewers, casting doubt on lessons learned through traditional metanarratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Formal Logic
The famous witch trial scene exemplifies the distortion of logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Sir Bedevere the Wise applies a "foolproof" logic test, equating witches to wood that floats like a duck, thereby justifying a woman's death if she weighs the same as a duck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This grotesque distortion of formal logic casts doubt on fundamental faith in logic itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### The Film Medium Itself
By the end of *The Holy Grail*, the distortion extends to the film itself, breaking the fourth wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Modern-day police suddenly arrive and arrest King Arthur, pushing and covering the camera lens, making the audience aware they are watching a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The film constantly pokes fun at its status as a "movie," for instance:
*   **Subtitles**: Swedish subtitles promoting Sweden as a vacation spot appear during the film's title credits, leading to the "credit-makers" being fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Budgetary Constraints**: Arthur uses coconuts instead of a horse due to the film's tight budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Self-Referential Dialogue**: Arthur refers to a character as "it's the old man from scene 24" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Plot Resolution**: The knights defeat the Legendary Black Beast of Arghhh not through battle, but because the animator designing the creature has a heart-attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

This self-reflexivity reveals *The Holy Grail* to be its own metanarrative, emphasizing that film is as artificial as the chivalrous Arthurian heroes within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The film deconstructs religion and logic within a deconstruction of heroic tropes, all within a deconstruction of the film medium itself, making it "the [[critiques_of_inceptions_exposition_and_narrative_style | Inception]] of postmodern film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## [[comedy_of_the_absurd_and_existentialist_themes | Comedy of the Absurd]] and Existentialism in *The Life of Brian*

Monty Python's brand of comedy is foundational to [[comedy_of_the_absurd_and_existentialist_themes | tragic absurdity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. [[comedy_of_the_absurd_and_existentialist_themes | The Comedy of the Absurd]], an existential-based comedy, focuses on the fallout of confronting a world devoid of meaning, finding humor in tragic insignificance rather than wallowing in despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

In *The Life of Brian*, poor Brian's entire existence is one big absurd misunderstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Born next to Jesus, he is mistakenly believed to be the Messiah by the Three Wise Men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This projection of significance onto the insignificant is a hallmark of existential thought, particularly that of Albert Camus, who embraced "The Absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. When Brian runs away, his disciples mistakenly believe he's risen to heaven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Later, when he loses a sandal, the disciples proclaim it his "sign," attributing significance to a mere piece of footwear in their desire for meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This "misappropriation of meaning" is the source of humor in absurd comedies, drawing from the discrepancy between what is true and what people believe to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

Characters in absurd comedies are often caught in hopeless situations, forced into repetitive and fruitless actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Brian constantly tries to tell his disciples he's not the Messiah, but to no avail, leading to his horrific crucifixion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Yet, despite his impending doom, Brian is comforted by fellow crucifixion buddies who break into the song "The Bright Side of Life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This cheerful lament reflects "The Myth of Sisyphus," which Albert Camus applied to life itself, suggesting that the trick is not to let meaninglessness get you down, but to "always look at the bright-side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## [[monty_pythons_satirical_take_on_political_and_social_issues | Satire]] and Political Deconstruction

Monty Python paved the way for political [[monty_pythons_satirical_take_on_political_and_social_issues | satire]], which derives humor by revealing hypocrisy in established rules and orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. *South Park* creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone cite Monty Python as their biggest influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

In Monty Python's final feature, *The Meaning of Life*, they openly comment on English imperialism, economic disparity, and classist social hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

*   **Critique of Capitalism**: The opening mini-movie, "The Crimson Permanent Assurance," depicts poor elderly workers rebelling against "young American yuppies," destroying corporate buildings and the capitalist system that "literally anchored them to the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The film questions the economic notion that self-interest leads to the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. In "The Miracle of Birth," doctors prioritize expensive equipment and administrators over the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. In "Live Organ Transplants," bureaucrats forcefully remove a liver from an impoverished man for the good of the country, nonsensically remarking that they must kill him to take his liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Economic Disparity**: Britain's Yorkshire is ironically called a "Third World Country," where a poor man is forced to sell his children to science to make ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This disparity climaxes in "The Autumn Years," where the grotesquely obese Mr. Creosote eats until he explodes, implying the rich get richer "at the expense of the starving lower class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **British Imperialism**: The Pythons skewer the notion of British imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. A military officer insisting Britain needs an army to put down differing ideologies is struck down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. A Sergeant Major drills his platoon on whether they have "anything better to do than 'march up and down the town square,'" only for them to confirm they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The film's central thesis is "Try and be nice to people, avoid getting fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations," suggesting British imperialism is a threat to the meaning of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. War is depicted brutally, with soldiers celebrating a birthday gunned down, juxtaposing the reality of "imperial conquest" against simple pleasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

Their sketch show, *The Flying Circus*, often portrayed bureaucrats as "buffoons" or "sticks-in-the-mud" who constantly censor the show itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. As Christopher Hitchens noted, the "essential founding gag" of Monty Python was the "bubbling magma of absurdity that lay beneath the fragile crust of British reserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

By merging social commentary, existential angst, and silliness, Monty Python defied convention, creating a singular brand of comedy that remains influential in the [[influence_of_monty_python_on_modern_comedy | landscape of modern comedy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

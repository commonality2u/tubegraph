The third season of *Rick and Morty* consistently highlights the meaninglessness of existence, asserting that nothing truly matters and that events unfold infinitely across infinite realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This presents an "interesting challenge" for a TV show: how can characters grow when life holds no inherent meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>? The series offers a "novel solution" beyond spiraling deeper into nihilism, focusing on the growth of Beth, the matriarch of the Smith family, rather than the titular protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Beth's Existential Dilemma

In "The Rickchurian Mortydate," the season three finale, Beth confronts a profound personal crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Following the events of Episode 9, she questions whether she took Rick's offer to be replaced by a clone and if she is, in fact, the clone herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. To resolve this, she seeks out [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]], who helps her recreate one of their first dates, rekindling their love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, still concerned about being a "Blade Runner" clone, Beth flees to the woods with her family, where Rick appears, seemingly to kill [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]] and convince her she isn't a clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Radical Freedom and Beth's Choice

Previously, Rick informed Beth about the implications of her intelligence: "Am I evil? Worse. You’re smart. When you know nothing matters the universe is yours and I’ve never met a universe that was into it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Rick's typical response to this is "Don't think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Faced with this philosophical outlook, Beth is given "radical freedom" to choose her destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This freedom brings her solace regardless of whether she chooses to stay with or leave her family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Rick assures her: "Then stay and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you've chosen. My secret bonus is that no matter what you choose you're finally gonna chill the f*** out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The episode suggests Beth chose to stay, finding a newfound sense of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. She becomes a "better mother" to Summer and finally loves [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]], bringing her family back together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Amor Fati: Loving One's Fate

While some might find Beth's sudden rekindling of love for [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]] "weird," the episode introduces the concept of *Amor Fati*—"Love of Fate"—as an explanation for her paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Confronting the Past
*Amor Fati*, a Latin phrase used by Friedrich Nietzsche, signifies an affirmation of life, being a "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It's connected to Nietzsche's thought experiment of "Eternal Recurrence," where one imagines reliving their entire life infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. To desire to relive every moment—the good, the bad, and everything in between—is the "ultimate affirmation of life" and *Amor Fati* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This concept is central to Nietzsche's strategy for escaping the "crushing nihilism of existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Given Beth's existential crisis and her "Rick-like disillusionment-causing intelligence," she is compelled to confront her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. With [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]], she gets to re-live a small part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Although she may have hated her life, including her first date with [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]], this time she becomes a Nietzschean "Yes-Sayer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

*Amor Fati* isn't about rewriting the past or seeing "everything as a blessing in disguise," but rather about not shunning the "ugly aspects of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Beth doesn't deny years of misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>; she acknowledges she's no longer the woman [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]] married <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The transcript suggests that [[character_analysis_of_jerry_in_rick_and_morty | Jerry]]'s "simplicity" might be what Beth needs, given her family's history of using intelligence to justify destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Another *Amor Fati*-esque moment occurs when Beth believes Rick has come to "retire" her. She functionally embraces being left with her family rather than dwelling on what could have been, choosing to stay in "this one" universe despite infinite possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Beth's Ubermensch-like Development

Beth grapples with the "impossible task of 'knowing oneself'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>: "I'm out of excuses to not be who I am. So, who am I? What do I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Nietzsche believed the logic behind why we do anything is "impenetrable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For Beth, fretting over whether she chose to be cloned or if any of it matters across infinite versions of herself is irrelevant; Nietzsche would argue that "all we can do is love our fate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This appears to be the choice Beth has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

While Rick is often portrayed as a Nietzschean *ubermensch* at war with the meaningless cosmos, he tends to "dick around in the most self destructive way possible" rather than creating new meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Beth, however, when faced with the cosmos' meaninglessness, finds happiness, a trait deemed "pretty ubermenschy" by the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This highlights a significant [[character_development_in_rick_and_morty | character development]] for Beth, as she embraces her reality and finds solace within it.

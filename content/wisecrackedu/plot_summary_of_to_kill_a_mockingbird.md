*To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee is set in the South during the Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39">[02:39]</a>. The book centers on three main characters: Scout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19">[00:19]</a>, her brother Jem, who is described as crippled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23">[00:23]</a>, and a boy named Dill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25">[00:25]</a>. Scout's father, Atticus, is a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27">[00:27]</a>.

## Initial Events

In Alabama, where there isn't much to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31">[00:31]</a>, Scout and her friends spend a summer bothering a reclusive neighbor named Boo Radley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34">[00:34]</a>. Boo Radley has not been seen for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38">[00:38]</a>. The children attempt to pass Boo a note to see if he wants to socialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41">[00:41]</a>, but Atticus intervenes, telling them to:
> "Leave a brother be." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45">[00:45]</a>

The next day, a person confronts Scout and calls her father, Atticus, a "Nigger lover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49">[00:49]</a>. This insult stems from Atticus's decision to defend Tom Robinson, a Black man accused of raping the daughter of Bob Ewell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56">[00:56]</a>.

## The Trial

During the trial, Atticus presents a strong defense in the courtroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06">[01:06]</a>. He discovers that it was Ewell's daughter who was making advances on Tom Robinson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10">[01:10]</a>. The transcript suggests she wanted "dark chocolate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14">[01:14]</a>. After witnessing his daughter making advances on a Black man, Mr. Ewell physically assaulted her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18">[01:18]</a>, while Tom left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21">[01:21]</a>. Despite the evidence, Tom Robinson is convicted because he is Black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25">[01:25]</a>.

## Aftermath and Resolution

Enraged that Atticus made him look foolish in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32">[01:32]</a>, Bob Ewell attacks Jem and Scout on Halloween night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36">[01:36]</a>. As Ewell is about to harm Scout, Boo Radley unexpectedly appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41">[01:41]</a> and kills Ewell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>.

To avoid further complications and considering Boo Radley's nature, the town authorities decide that Ewell's death was self-inflicted; he supposedly got too drunk and fell on his knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50">[01:50]</a>. Boo Radley is allowed to go free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>. This decision is likened to "Shootin' a mockingbird," as Scout puts it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00">[02:00]</a>.

The idea of not harming a mockingbird, as explained in a quote from page 90, means that only a fool would kill a mockingbird because they only provide enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09">[02:09]</a>. Therefore, revealing Boo Radley's actions would be detrimental, as it would get rid of a good person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>. Having already made a mistake by convicting Tom, the authorities avoid "popping another mockingbird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34">[02:34]</a>.

## Underlying Themes and Symbolism

The book serves as a criticism of the South during the Depression, highlighting that its courts, schools, and churches were controlled by corrupt individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44">[02:44]</a>.

Initially, Scout exhibits Southern racism and ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49">[02:49]</a>. However, through her interactions with Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, she matures and gains a more realistic understanding of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>. A core [[characters_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | theme]] of the book is learning valuable lessons by interacting with different types of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>. Her experiences lead to a "paradigm shifting moment" where she learns that people are just trying to live their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>.

Jem's crippled arm is presented as a [[symbolism_in_to_kill_a_mockingbird | metaphor]] for America's flawed justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[03:21]</a>. His arm being injured at a young age is described as a synecdoche for a country born with "backward ass ideals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24">[03:24]</a>. While the injury might heal, it will leave a permanent "disabling scar on the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30">[03:30]</a>.

Quentin Tarantino's film *Inglourious Basterds* makes a significant statement about the power of film, suggesting that cinema can tear down oppressive regimes just as it can build them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The movie posits that the camera is more powerful than the sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, implying that film could effectively combat nazism by winning the war in people's minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Cinema historically served to cement anti-Nazism as the norm for American culture, which was widely exported globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. However, this power of cinema has been challenged by the rise of the [[social_media_and_its_economic_impact_on_personal_relationships | internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## The Decline of Cinema's Cultural Influence

Tarantino's film emphasizes the power of going to the theater, a communal activity shared with many people experiencing the same thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This communal viewing transforms watching movies into a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Ritualized activities, such as paying for a ticket, finding a seat, and watching the movie, lend a greater importance to the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Tarantino, a staunch defender of film, shoots all his movies on film and resists digital projection, believing the ritual elements of film (like the sound of the projector or changing reels) supercharge the theater experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This power allowed film stories to have a lasting impact on communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

However, this is no longer the prevailing way people consume media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. People can now stay abreast of major movie releases without leaving their beds, eliminating the built-in ritual of engaging with movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This means movies no longer resonate as strongly, and individuals can [[societys_impact_on_personal_agency | curate their own cultural experience]] that is hyper-tailored to their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The dissolution of cinema's potency leads to the loss of its cultural power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## McLuhan's "Global Village" and the Death of Monoculture

The source of this shift is the [[social_media_and_its_economic_impact_on_personal_relationships | internet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Media theorist Marshall McLuhan, in his work *The Global Village*, predicted that the "global media networking" of the future would lead to the "death of monoculture," where everyone engages in their own distinct cultural activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Robotism and Decentralized Culture

McLuhan termed this phenomenon "robotism," or right hemisphere thinking, which is the capacity to be a conscious presence in many places at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. While left hemisphere thinking (associated with hierarchical reasoning and visual space) has historically dominated the Western world, technology is pushing humanity towards right hemisphere thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Left hemisphere thinking assumes shared culture and rules, like the ideal that Nazis are evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. In contrast, right hemisphere thinking rejects these shared ideas, leading individuals to develop their own belief systems and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## The Loss of a "Ruling Center"

McLuhan identified that this splintering of society is a result of losing a "ruling center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. He described culture as becoming organized like an electric circuit, where each point is as central as the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This means society loses touch with a central authority or shared social restraints based on interconnection, leading to constant dissolution and reformation of hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

The "ruling center" represents the shared beliefs that enable society to function, such as the agreement that it's good to be kind and bad to persecute people based on their ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. As this shared agreement weakens, previously suppressed negative behaviors can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. In a decentralized, circuit-like culture, there is no fixed ethical center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Individuals may derive their ethics from diverse online sources such as Facebook, Twitter, Something Awful, 4chan, Snapchat, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This fragmentation prevents a collective agreement on rules and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Consequences for Shared Norms

The rise of xenophobic, neo-fascist political groups, anti-Semitic, and racist violence, and Nazi-esque content online demonstrates that Tarantino's theory about 35mm cinema permanently eradicating Nazism may no longer hold true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The [[social_media_and_its_economic_impact_on_personal_relationships | internet]]'s decentralization, while allowing for diverse and specialized content (like a YouTube channel analyzing philosophy and culture), also creates space for socially condemned behaviors like Nazism to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## Adaptation to a New Cultural Landscape

Even Quentin Tarantino, a fierce defender of the theater experience and film history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, has begun to adapt. He released his film *The Hateful Eight* as a four-part mini-series on Netflix, a move that would have been unthinkable for him just a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This indicates that even he recognizes the need to keep his voice relevant in the evolving cultural landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
